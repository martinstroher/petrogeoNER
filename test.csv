carbonate,"A carbonate is a sedimentary rock that is constituted by more than 50% by volume of carbonate minerals, principally calcite and/or dolomite. These minerals typically form from the accumulation of skeletal fragments of organisms or through direct chemical or biochemical precipitation from water. Limestone and dolostone are the most common types of carbonate rocks.",ROCHA
