Geological setting The breakup of the western Gondwana Super Continent and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean developed diachronously from south to north over the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous as recorded in the southern American Continent e g Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Szatmari 2000 Mohriak and Szatmari 2008 Carlotto et al 2017 In both conjugate South Atlantic margins offshore Brazil and offshore southwest Africa vast basins developed like the Santos Basin as result of phases of extension during the pre rift in the Late Hauterivian Early Barremian e g Karner and Gamboa 2007 Chaboureau et al 2013 Rifting promoted the development of an extensive half graben system leading to continental basins including interconnected lake systems but periodically isolated during times of reduced lake level as rifting pro ceeded from south to north the initial set of many small lakes gave way to regional flexural subsidence creating a widespread sag basin e g Carminatti et al 2008 Chaboureau et al 2013 Carlotto et al 2017 Pietzsch et al 2018 In offshore Brazil basins and their counterparts in the African margin the siliciclastic and carbonate successions that un derlay extensive evaporite units are currently named informally as Pre Salt and are considered to range in age from Hauterivian to Aptian times They are generally interpreted as having been deposited in lakes and associated terrestrial environments namely fluvio deltaic or allu vial fan systems based on several lines of evidence e g Karner and Gamboa 2007 Carminatti et al 2008 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Tavares et al 2015 Thompson et al 2015 Saller et al 2016 The biostratigraphic framework of these South Atlantic basins is mostly based on ostracod biozonation e g Poropat and Colin 2012 The western South Atlantic Pre Salt Basin is 400 km wide at its southern edge Santos Basin Fig 1 narrowing towards NE Brazil to 100 km Sergipe Alagoas Basin In the southern part of the Brazilian proto Atlantic margin initial rifting and subsidence are evidenced by intense basalt extrusion the subsequent phases of subsidence and sedi mentation are traditionally considered as defining three megasequences overall similar in all the marginal basins of Brazil continental transi tional and marine megasequences Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Moreira et al 2007 Mohriak and Szatmari 2008 Buckley et al 2015 Accordingly the sedimentary infilling of the Santos Basin is usually divided into three super sequences rift post rift often referred to as sag phase and drift super sequences Fig 2 The timing of rifting or thermal sag is still being debated e g Ceraldi and Green 2017 and references therein The rift succession is essentially composed of con tinental siliciclastics lacustrine coquinas forming important reservoir intervals e g Moreira et al 2007 Carlotto et al 2017 and organic rich shales corresponding to of the Piçarras and Itapema for mations The late rift and post rift sag sequence comprises lacustrine carbonates comprising the most prominent reservoirs e g Carminatti et al 2008 Carlotto et al 2017 and shales of the Barra Velha For mation followed by the huge accumulation of evaporite deposits composing the Ariri Formation which express the flooding of the basin by sea water Fig 2 The salt forms the effective regional seal for hy drocarbons hosted in underlying reservoirs Above the salt drift phase marine sediments developed as the region evolved into a passive margin e g Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Mohriak and Szatmari 2008 Car lotto et al 2017 The Santos Basin is located between latitudes of 23 and 28 S in the southeast portion of the Brazilian margin being limited by the Cabo Frio and Florianopolis Highs respectively Moreira et al 2007 Carlotto Fig 2 Regional

Wright and Barnett 2020 et al 2017 Fig 1 This basin encompasses about 350 000 km2 with water depths in excess of 3000 m The reservoirs addressed in this study belong to the upper part of the Aptian Barra Velha Formation in the Santos Basin Fig 2 The Barra Velha unit lies within the traditional Brazilian Alagoas stage formation Moreira et al 2007 and its thickness varies significantly across the basin from over 500 to 55 m on fault blocks highs along which it may be locally absent e g Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 It is bounded at its base by the Pre Alagoas unconformity that separates it from the un derlying bivalve coquina bearing units is divisible by the intra formational Intra Alagoas unconformity and capped by the base of salt unconformity e g Moreira et al 2007 Wright and Barnett 2020 Gomes et al 2020 3 Material and methods The studied material includes cores plugs sidewall samples and thin sections from two wells Well 1 and Well 2 in a sector of Santos Basin which correspond to the upper part of the Barra Velha Formation but at different intervals and geomorphic positions thus it is not meaningful to correlate them directly From Well 1 the core length is 14 m 68 m below the base of salt from Well 2 the core length is 36 m 122 m below the base of salt In addition to cores 127 Well 1 and 101 Well 2 sidewall samples 39 Well 1 and 143 Well 2 plugs and c 140 thin sections in total were available for study The material was analysed at CENPES Petrobras in Rio de Janeiro Brazil using con ventional hand lenses and 10 HCl acid for macroscale core observation and description binocular microscope and Zeiss optical microscope with photographic camera for fast microscale analysis and description a coupled Axion Vision software was used for photo management The set of photomicrographs are original data of the authors The microfacies study was later improved through very detailed analysis of the thinsection photos performed at the Faculdade de Cie ncias da Uni versidade de Lisboa FCUL The in site description of the cores and samples was also later revisited and improved at FCUL with construc tion of systematic box by box sheets compiling core photos which cannot be shown here lithologies and facies types as defined by this team textures porosity evidence of diagenetic processes and other particular aspects colour codes were used for facies types and porosity degree to enhance graphic clarity and ease analysis of the overall data along the wells an example of the description sheet and symbols used are shown in Fig 3 3

Very locally and rare possible shell fragments and unidentified structures resembling algae were detected together in the same thin section mixed with shrub material Fig 5 C The shrub intervals as a whole occur predominantly as horizontal layers very locally they make a domal shaped structure It is common to find F2A as interstitial material within the main F2B framework Fig 6 A More rarely this F2B is composed of very small less than 2 mm high shrubs here called micro shrubs corresponding to the F2B2 sub type These very small shrubs form regular layers a few millimetres thick which occur interbedded with F2B and F2A and usually show a regular preferentially bedding parallel tight arrangement Fig 7 A Both F2B and F2B2 may include small spherulites spherulitic coatings micritic coatings and very rarely small ostracods or ostracod moulds Another subtype of the F2B facies is here created for very delicate finely structured highly porous textures lacy aspect named lacy F2B Fig 7 C and D with poor element definition at core scale exami nation but in which at microscale a ghost framework texture is recognizable This suggests it to be a residual texture from an originally connected framework that is a structured non random morphology resembling the outlines and branching of shrubs Fig 7 C and D Therefore this textural type is here interpreted as remnant of F2B and accordingly included as a subtype in F2B Other cases show similarly highly porous some still inter connected structures mixed with partially broken collapsed fragments of the shrubby material acquiring an aspect closer to grain dominated car bonates these examples are interpreted here as having closer textural affinity with the next described facies type F3 thus being named F2B quasi F3 Fig 7 E and F In fact a transitional suite from F2B to lacy F2B to quasi F3 and F3 is recognized see also F3 as discussed in 7 Diagenesis The inter shrub space is commonly totally or partially void when occluded calcite or dolomite more common occur as crystalline ce ments pore linings and infillings sometimes also argillaceous and micrite material interstitial laminae of F2A or rarely siliceous matter Figs 6 A C and D 8 A and C It is particular noteworthy that dolomite in the inter shrub space occurs commonly as apparently floating rhombs either scattered or in clusters or only linked by very thin tiny bridges Fig 8 A and D There are pores within the shrub structures themselves which depending on the growth development and preser vation stage of the shrubs may appear as growth framework vugs inter and intra particle pores Figs 6 A C and D 7 B in the case of the dolomite masses inter crystalline porosity may occur also Fig 8 A and C Overall F2B commonly exhibits high porosity that may be even excellent especially F2BT lacy F2B and F2B quasi F3 but some times moderate and rarely low porosity are also recorded in F2B amal gamated arrangements Fig 8 F and in F2B2 The pore system network differs between F2BT and lacy F2B with usually larger size pores in F2BT and higher tortuosity in lacy F2B Fig 7 C and D The small well sorted shrubs of F2B2 usually form a tighter lower porosity texture but the straighter channel pores may potentially enhance permeability Fig 7 A It is notable that all the types of F2B may have interbedded siliceous layers irregular bands or nodules Fig 8 A as well as recrystallization zones visible at macroscale F2B except for F2B2 is one the most abundant in the two studied cores and typically occurs successively for several metres though thinner intervals and intercalations of other facies are common namely of the next described F3 Figs 6 F 7 B 8 B The textural classification of these facies and subtypes is problem atic due to the uncertainty on their genetic process Azere do et al 2011 2018 see also 5 Palaeoenvironmental interpretation and 8 Dis cussion If dominant microbial origin is accepted they would fit into the boundstone definition but if the abiotic hypotheses are favoured then they are developed in situ but not organically made In the latter case they could be referred as pseudo boundstones or precipitated boundstones following Della Porta 2015 or cementstones following Wright 1992 More specific comparison may be made with the ter minologies recently proposed for the Barra Velha carbonate facies the F2B of this work is roughly equivalent to the F1 F1a either with inter shrub Mg silicate matrix or porous respectively of Wright and Barnett 2017a 2020 and fit well into the term shrubstones coined by Gomes et al 2020 4 3 Facies 3 F3 intraclastic grainstones packstones whose clasts are mostly F2B remnants These limestones apparently exhibit a grain supported textural appearance corresponding to intraclastic grainstones packstones more rarely rudstones floatstones but with a special characteristic the term apparently is used deliberately to stress the interpretative classifica tion the clasts are mostly F2B collapsed structures and remains that is apparently having disaggregated into pieces in situ or almost with no or just incipient reworking Figs 7 B E and F 8 B and E 9 A and B a few more clearly reworked grains occur This rock type is regarded as an essentially diagenetic texture with minor depositional contribution so to be classified as mainly diagenetic not depositional grainstones mostly or packstones see 7 Diagenesis and 8 Discussion However for simplicity concerning the general characterization of these microf acies we use the classical textural terms of Dunham 1962 and Embry and Klovan 1971 These carbonates may exhibit a variable range of particles from dominant differently sized more usually medium grained fragments of F2B structures as said here interpreted as mostly in situ commonly interlinked locally exhibiting a more amalgamated arrangement likely due to slight compaction to less common well defined intraclasts locally dark coated grains a few oncoids elements with a few oncoidal coating layers spherulites and peloids Fig 9 A and B There may be an inter granular crystalline cement often dolomitic locally micrite or silica This set of elements makes up a more granular fabric Fig 9 A and B but most commonly the fragments arrangement and their interconnection are strongly suggestive of a previous organized struc ture and morphology thus an originally non granular fabric for which the currently observed one would be a remnant ghost Figs 7 E and F 8 E interpreted as having textural affinity with the previously described facies subtype F2B quasi F3 as said Very rarely a very faint lami nation is observed Siliceous layers irregular bands or nodules as well as pervasively recrystallized zones commonly with irregular outlines visible at macroscale may occur Fig 8 B In similarity to F2B this facies may occur successively for several metres though thinner intervals and in tercalations of other facies are common and next to F2A and F2B is the most abundant in both cores This F3 commonly exhibits high to excellent porosity but in some cases low moderate pore development occurs No exact match between this facies and those typified by previous authors is recognized The best resemblance would be cases named as spherulitic shrubstone and shrubby spherulitstone by Gomes et al 2020 but in the studied cases only sometimes the particles are spherulites as described More often the clasts are clearly simply shrub fragments locally coated but mostly exhibiting no or incipient reworking and almost in situ redeposition The F5 of Wright and Barnett 2017a 2020 in particular as detailed in Barnett et al 2018 corre sponds also to grainstones and rudstones comprising fragments of crystal shrubs spherulites intraclasts and in some cases peloids and volcanic fragments one of their subtypes is dominantly composed of intraclasts of re worked crystal shrubs mainly coarse to very coarse grained up to pebble grade with planar to low angle lamination and very rarely cross lamination The clear reworked character of the shrub clasts the very coarse grained size no preserved or perceived previous connection among shrub fragments and clear lamination

peloids and volcanic fragments the studied examples differing in the dominant fineto medium grained size and absence of volcanic clasts the latter were recognized in previous studies of the authors in

spherulites among other components in the other facies The spherulites also been referred to as fibro radial spherulitic polycrystals or spherules Chafetz et al 2018 are rounded elements made by a radiating array of calcite crystals with sweeping extinction and typical pleochroic rosettes in the studied cores they range from 0 12 mm to 1 2 mm in diametre though previous au thors report larger size ranges for instance commonly less than 2 mm but reaching c 15 mm Terra et al 2009 Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 and from 0 1 to 4 mm Gomes et al 2020 The spherulites are often silicified Fig 9 C and D less frequently dolomitized or recrys tallized and some spherulitic grains show a component similar to a shrub but with a fascicular optic calcite aspect more rarely they may be coated Fig 9 C The bounding material is microcrystalline calcite dolomite or silica chalcedony or microcrystalline quartz Porosity in F4 is absent to locally low F4 is present only in Well 2 along centimetre to decimetre thick intervals almost always with sharp boundaries to under and overlaying facies This facies type is equivalent to the F2a of Wright and Barnett 2017a 2020 and to the spherulitestone of Gomes et al 2020 In contrast with other sectors of Santos Basin differentiated spherulitic grainstones and packstones are not so much common as to make this F4 one of the predominant facies though spherulitic particles within several of the other facies are common as described The facies here labelled F6 contrasts with the remainder facies types in having oncoidal material as dominant allochems thus corresponds to oncoidal rich grainstones rudstones and packstones floatstones It in cludes well defined individualized oncoids oncoidal coated fragments and aggregates with associated intraclasts Fig 9 F The oncoidal par ticles range from less than 0 5 mm to more than 3 5 mm with the in ternal concentric laminar structure clearly to moderately developed though frequently affected by intraparticle dissolution this may be so strong locally as to result in almost mouldic porosity where the original oncoidal nature is recognizable because of the coexistence with better preserved oncoids Fig 11 C The bounding material may be micrite and or crystalline dolomitic cement locally calcite with gravitational morphology and siliceous cement Porosity in this facies is low to moderate made by mostly intra granular pores but unconnected This facies type F6 only occurs at a few intervals in Well 1 Wright and Barnett 2017a 2020 included oncolite bearing car bonates in their microbial facies F4 4 5 Facies 5 F5 intraclastic grainstones and packstones 5 Palaeoenvironmental interpretation Intraclastic grainstones and packstones locally rudstones with heterogeneous textural arrangement Fig 9 E most usually showing a massive packing with little cement but locally showing grains more loosely distributed in larger cement amount see also 7 Diagenesis and Fig 11 A and B These limestones are characterized by the common presence of dark grains whereas in F3 they are rare besides the more common intraclasts the clasts are of various sizes but more commonly fine to medium grained and moderately sorted rounded subrounded to subangular overall defining clear evidence of reworking Among the intraclasts some are similar to F3 elements remnants of shrubs but with a more worn and reworked aspect as evidenced by abraded poorly preserved structure of the particles some with irregular outlines and the scattered distribution no inter linked pieces as in F3 a few intra clasts may exhibit a thin dark coating likely of micrite clayey micrite Besides intraclasts peloids are also found Very rarely a faint graded lamination is observed Argillaceous matrix material and siliceous nodules may occur The bounding material is of carbonate or siliceous nature The presence of cement or cement plus matrix among the grains is another difference to F3 which is typically highly porous with no or only bridges of interstitial material The silica ranges from crypto to mesocrystalline and in some cases it is not possible to be sure whether it was precipitated as siliceous cement or resulted from silicification of previous carbonate cement In other cases a clear difference is seen in size and morphology between crystals surrounding the grains and crystals in remaining intergranular space suggesting that there was at least a precursor circum granular cement later silicified this inference is reinforced by the occurrence of similar microcrystalline silica infilling local intragranular porosity Porosity in F5 is low to inexistent F5 intervals in the studied cores range from centimetre to 0 50 0 60 m thick almost always with sharp boundaries to under and overlaying facies This facies type basically compares with F5 of Wright and Barnett 2017a 2020 more detailed in Barnett et al 2018 namely their grainstones and rudstones comprising clearly reworked fragments of The palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the Pre Salt carbonate facies is rather difficult due to the uncertainties of present knowledge concerning the genesis of these deposits and the extensive amount of data confidentiality It is fairly clear that they were originated in nonmarine depositional settings basically in alkaline lakes with variable salinity the lack of marine fossils and of marine evaporite minerals is consistent with this scenario e g Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2008 Wright 2012 Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 Recent isotope geochemistry studies yielded results supporting freshwater to evaporitic lacustrine palaeoenvironments Pietzsch et al 2018 At certain sectors namely in the Campos Basin besides lakes there would be peri lacustrine transitional settings with terrigenous fluvio deltaic or alluvial fan systems Muniz and Bosence 2015 Tavares et al 2015 However in detail there are many doubts and different ideas have been discussed regarding lake styles and features topographic bathy metric configuration water depth hydro geochemistry geometry with two main end member conflicting models i deeper lakes with differentiated microbial platforms of hundred meters relief and smaller buildups Buckley et al 2015 ii very shallow evaporitic hyper alkaline lakes with predominantly abiotic carbonate and Mg silicate precipitate Wright and Barnett 2015 2017b Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Farias et al 2019 The latter model assumes that the km scale vertical relief now separating some intervals reflect significant post depositional but pre salt structuration largely due to post and some syn Barra Velha faulting and erosion Karner and Gamboa 2007 Wright and Barnett 2017b 2020 Wright 2019 Recently some possible variations and alternatives to those models were added by Pietzsch et al 2018 and Gomes et al 2020 Considering the huge dimensions of the Santos Basin it is likely that different sub basins with diverse configurations and environmental scenarios could have coexisted or succeeded each other depending on conditions developed on separate sectors and or their syn or postdepositional structuration The

A C Azere do et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 108 2021 103202 sectors and intervals of the basin succession reinforce this idea The debate on palaeonvironmental setting and evolution of these carbonates can only be seriously approached with wide and multidisciplinary dataset at the regional scale which is not the case of this study Therefore the palaeonvironmental interpretations made here are not intended to discuss previous wider scale models but only to better constrain each of the studied facies thus it is necessarily limited to the restricted sector and interval represented by the examined cores A crucial factor casting doubt on inferring the depositional conditions is the general lack of unequivocal palaeo depth markers with very rare exceptions poor fossil record indicates highly unusual life inhibiting environmental conditions namely too high alkalinity Exceptions would be possible microbial communities if these were at least partially responsible for the stromatolitic like layers and clotted laminae but this remains questionable as wider data was not available for this study In the Barra Velha unit over the basin there has been also little unequivocal evidence for microbial presence Wright 2012 2019 Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Similar facies in Campos Basin was reported to show microbial structures Muniz and Bosence 2015 The very rare small sized 1 mm in length ostracods occur as smooth carapaces or their moulds not loose valves indicating autochthony in agreement with these obser vations previous authors have referred to ostracods being present in the Santos Pre Salt carbonates with forms of a wide salinity tolerance and appearing to be non marine e g Wright and Barnett 2015 It is important to highlight the recognition in the present study of a char ophyte gyrogonite Fig 5 B plus rare submillimetric fragments possibly also belonging to charophytes but not that unequivocal Even being a very rare finding it is significant here to the authors knowledge it is the first clear documentation in the Brazilian Pre Salt carbonates of this group of benthic green algae typically inhabiting upper photic zone of fresh to brackish very locally saline waters The reason for the extreme paucity of their record in the Barra Velha Formation is not clear but a combination of possible causes may be speculated i it is known that a few charophytes can survive in higher salinity conditions as docu mented for instance in the margins of saline coastal lakes of Australia fed by groundwaters of varying salinities Burne et al 1980 but germi nation of fertilized oogonia apparently requires lower salinities Thus the fact that in the Pre Salt lakes the trend was of common periods and general evolution towards increasing salinity e g Ceraldi and Green 2017 Pietzsch et al 2018 would not favour proliferation and survival of a charophyte flora ii another likely cause could be lack of calcium carbonate bioavailability for algae calcification considering the strong consumption required for the huge shrub development Overall the data attests for very shallow restricted low energy strongly alkaline and probably episodically saline lake setting In these unusual geochemical conditions there could be generation and accu mulation of the reported Mg rich clayey material previously discussed which is often observed in association with the F2A laminations Therefore as it is here interpreted this F2A would represent the typical carbonate facies on the marginal lacustrine zones developed laterally to other facies formed in slightly deeper water column namely the F2B and or in periods during which the lake waters would become less supersaturated in calcium carbonate as compared to those favouring the exuberant development of the F2B shrubby structures see below The examples of laminated microbialites from Campos Basin were interpreted to be more marginal marine depositional systems Muniz and Bosence 2015 5 1 Facies 1 F1 These argillaceous limestones are assigned to low energy deposi tional conditions under a moderately deep water column deeper than that of the other facies defined in this study though not very deep with some fine grained terrigenous supply These conditions are deduced from the fine grained nature of the sediments mixture of carbonate and argillaceous material presence of some organic matter lack of reworking suggesting no bottom currents and weak water circulation the general absence of significant mass flow resedimentation events and only very locally syn sedimentary deformation signs imply negligible slopes and weak steep gradients and interbedding with shallower water facies with no signs of irregular contacts or erosion is consistent with the envisaged scenario In addition the fact that the main clay minerals present in the Barra Velha Formation are Al free Mg silicate minerals Tosca and Wright 2015 suggests according to Gomes et al 2020 that they were pre served in sub littoral but not too deep zones where Mg clays would dissolve The generation of authigenic Mg clay minerals in alkaline and saline lacustrine environments is well documented with stevensite being reported to form in highly alkaline lake waters of pH 9 Khoury et al 1982 Jones 1986 Calvo et al 1999 Tosca and Wright 2015 Saller et al 2016 It remains a matter of discussion if they are the likely product of biotically bacterially mediated precipitation of precipita tion driven by abiotic process such as evaporation or both e g Tosca and Wright 2015 Perri et al 2018 Gomes et al 2020 Deposition of this facies could be related to meteoric water flooding events increasing lake water level and diluting freshening the water thus promoting hydrochemistry changes albeit minor towards slightly decreased alkalinity but remaining alkaline and lower salinity which would be less favourable to most intense carbonate precipitation as those origi nating the F2 The presence of pre compaction silica nodules in this facies is also consistent with freshening of lake waters as pointed by Wright and Barnett 2020 as silica precipitation is favoured by a lowering of alkalinity However the interpretation here requires further evidence as it is also possible to admit other situations like changes in precipitation evaporation linked to arid semiarid humid climate modes or variable detrital influx from the hinterland see for instance Wright and Barnett 2015 Gomes et al 2020 5 3 Facies 2B F2B The robust ramified and well developed shrub framework with growths composed of successive stacked bands of densely arranged calcite crystals perpendicular to structure growth axis implies in situ formation The strong often exuberant development of these shrub structures vertically continuous and laterally linked without or only very locally showing erosion or top truncation and with no evidence of subaerial exposure further supports in situ growth under persistent subaquatic conditions The terrigenous supply would be minimal and discontinuous during F2B formation The water column would be oxygenated shallow but slightly deeper than as for F2A with persistent calcium carbonate oversaturation and very high alkalinity allowing such high carbonate productivity and preservation likely highly saline due to the high ion concentration According to Saller et al 2016 calcite composing similar shrub structures of Kwanza Basin in the conjugate west African margin has high strontium concentrations average 3000 ppm which is explained by the authors as related to generally high 5 2 Facies 2A F2A The dominant tabular morphology of these carbonate layers with laminar macro to microstructure that may vary from planar to wavy but bedding parallel also when interstitial among F2B suggest prefer ential lateral development over vertical growth and accumulation like in mats under a very shallow water column There is common fenestral and pseudo fenestral porosity the former supporting the inference for very shallow setting with intermittent emersion events very locally sparse micro cracks resembling desiccation cracks occur which would also imply rare short subaerial exposure Besides the abiotic or biotic processes that may have assisted in carbonate origin the minor occur rence of interstitial muddy material likely micrite with clay matrix cement indicates low energy depositional conditions The dramatically 13

inhibits or totally pre vents metazoan life Konhauser 2006 Wright and Barnett 2020 explaining the striking lack of fossil record in these carbonates locally very rare ostracods similar to those in F2A The common association of F2A laminae with the shrubs F2B F2BT either interstitial among the main framework or as lenses bands suggests spatial proximity between these facies hence common gradual transitions and small scale interwoven between them This corroborates the inference that their depositional settings would not be much different as regards location within the lake system although with deeper water column higher available space for subaquatic aggrada tion in the case of F2B F2BT comparing to F2A The micro shrubs of F2B2 are possibly an exception as their side by side alignment forming thin layers may reflect also a reduced water depth or alternatively markedly decreased calcite supersaturation and or changes in abun dance of components due to variations in lake water chemistry inde pendent of water depth variations e g Wright 2011 2012 Mercedes Martín et al 2019 within Mg Si matrices Dorobek et al 2012 or as crystal growth in the presence of specific organic compounds Mercedes Martín et al 2016 Kirkham and Tucker 2018 admitted that microbial activity may initiate spherulite formation but the crystal growth itself be abiotic Tutolo and Tosca 2018 based on experimental work and geochemical modelling suggested that although solutions supersaturated with respect to Mg silicate commonly produce hydrated gels neither elevated con centration of organic acids nor biological mediation nor a gel matrix are required for calcium carbonate to attain a spherulitic morphology However Wright and Barnett 2020 point out that spherulites are commonly re worked and yet re worked Mg silicate clay fragments are exceedingly rare in the Barra Velha Formation successions and suggest as the most likely explanation that spherulites would have been re worked when still in a gel matrix which were then dispersed into the water column and re dissolved Where not re worked during shallow burial dehydration of the Mg silicate gel would trigger formation of Mg silicates such as stevensite e g Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2020 In the present study as mentioned F4 is not common unlike in other intervals of Santos Basin It was recognized only in Well 2 with sharp boundaries to under and overlaying facies It is notable that these spherulitic grainstones packstones are usually strongly cemented by microcrystalline calcite dolomite or silica but only locally compaction features were recognized concave convex contacts stylolytes They are often pervasively silicified More rarely coated spherulites occur Fig 9 C suggesting shallow water deposition The overall conclusion only concerning the studied dataset is that spherulite accumulation and or possibly further growth with no other loose particles in between only cement generating the spherulitic grainstones of F4 may have dominantly occurred in somewhat different geochemical conditions relative to the other facies The existence of spherulites interspersed in the other facies namely in F2A here assumed to be deposited in shallow water and with micrite oncoidal coatings suggests that the particles themselves may less commonly form at the same conditions of those other facies but when exclusive they must represent a significant change The often non touching pattern of the spherulites suggests either pre existence of a depositional matrix keeping the grains floating and later diagenetically evolving to or being replaced by cement or simply rapid cement precipitation The former possibility is in line with the clay silica gel hypothesis raised and developed by Wright and Barnett 2014 2015 and Tosca and Wright 2015 closely followed by Herlinger et al 2017 the fast cementation does not seem so likely as if conditions were of quick carbonate precipitation then the other types of structures and particles would have formed not only spherulites Mercedes Martín et al 2016 argued that clay gels were not required to produce spherulitic deposits which were more likely to have formed at the sediment water interface in alkaline lakes rich in dissolved organic acids There is no clear evidence in this study allowing to infer a relative depth location of the F4 deposition Some previous authors assigning the spherulite formation within a matrix suggest it occurred in very shallow subsurface below the water sediment interface Wright and Barnett 2015 2019 Herlinger et al 2017 whereas Kirkham and Tucker 2018 and Gomes et al 2020 admit they may have formed either in situ in the water column at the lake bed or in the subsurface and also that may have been reworked and resedimented 5 4 Facies 3 F3 As described F3 corresponds to apparently traditional grainsupported limestones namely intraclastic grainstones packstones whose clasts are mostly F2B collapsed structure and remains with no or incipient reworking plus a few more clearly grainy material intra clasts However a close coupled core and thin section analysis strongly suggests that this facies type is mostly an inherited residual fabric of F2B diagenetically modified and or accumulated almost non reworked F2B remains grains as discussed in Diagenesis The depositional setting and palaeo water depth would thus not significantly differ from those hosting the original shrubs of F2B maybe locally subjected to moderate energy short lived current or wave flows carrying reworking and redepositing the intraclastic material The almost lack of recognition of sedimentary structures associated with regular waves or currents in the studied core material does not support the persistence of directional flows in a highly hydrodynamic environment Barnett et al 2018 interpreted one of their subtypes of grainstones rudstones as colluvial wedges or debris aprons formed as a result of the sub aerial disaggre gation of mounds formed largely of crystal shrubs however as high lighted in 4 3 these deposits are different in several aspects from the facies defined in the present study 5 5 Facies 4 F4 There is a range of possible mechanisms leading to spherulite genesis in carbonates and the occurrence of this type of particles is documented in different environments namely in pedogenic and lacustrine carbon ates microbial mats speleothems tuffs and travertines e g Wright et al 1996 Dorobek et al 2012 Wright 2012 Wright and Barnett 2015 Saller et al 2016 Mercedes Martín et al 2017 Rogerson et al 2017 Chafetz et al 2018 Kirkham and Tucker 2018 and many ref erences therein However in the Pre Salt carbonates the spherulitic material is rather unusual because of their abundance at certain in tervals even to define an individual facies here named F4 the commonly larger dimensions than in previous reported cases occur rence either scattered within other facies floating in an argillaceous stevensitic matrix or in zones with no traces of clay e g Muniz and Bosence 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Saller et al 2016 Chafetz et al 2018 These spherulites could have grown at least in part within Mg Si gels later transformed into stevensite clay and subsequently dissolved producing excellent porosity Tosca and Wright 2014 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Tutolo and Tosca 2018 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Different interpretations have been proposed namely that fibro radial calcite results from displacive concretionary crystal growth 5 6 Facies 5 F5 The clear reworked heterogeneous aspect and tight packing of these intraclastic grainstones and packstones implies moderate to high energy flows rapid and weakly sorted grain deposition likely in more distal and or surrounding zones of the lake relative to the bodies made of successive F2A and F2B Such higher energy flows were probably episodic The lack of recognition of mass flow or syn depositional deformation sedimentary structures suggests that no significant slope 14

A C Azere do et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 108 2021 103202 relatively common F2A F2BT F2B2 Less clear and sparser occurring associations of F3 F5 and F2B F2B2 are recorded The recurrent succession of facies types along the studied cores show patterns of facies evolution and transition in turn suggesting deposi tional rhythms reflected in non uniform cyclical intervals These pat terns in the examined cores are usually recognized as follows Facies 2A with its typically laminar layers is succeeded by a strong development of the columnar shrubby structures of Facies 2B 2BT and less commonly 2B2 Heterogeneous occurrence of the other facies F1 F4 F5 and F6 either before after or within former intervals may happen as levels or lenses The ideal cyclothem would be as represented in Fig 10 A and three really observed examples are illustrated in Fig 10 B The recognized basic facies succession patterns are here considered as evidencing three main stages St of deposition development an initial stage St1 marked by F2A an irregularly occurring transitional stage St2 with deposition of any facies other than F2A and F2B and a clear shrub growing or development stage St3 The laminar F2A would represent a likely restricted environmental stage preceding apparently setting the stage for the ensuing strong development of shrubs This first stage would be characterized by very shallow water column where tabular and laminar structures developed but not easily the shrubs the water probably was not oversaturated relative to calcium carbonate and not extremely alkaline hence water depth and chemical conditions not favourable enough for shrubs to develop Subsequent change into thicker though always shallow water col umn hyper saturated relative to calcium carbonate and extremely alkaline allowed and maintained for time enough the exuberant growth development of the shrub structures composing Facies 2B 2BT and less commonly 2B2 Transitional or separating intervals of St2 encompass less clear situations with heterogeneous occurrence of other facies either before after or within any of both other phases It is also to note that F3 may appear in any of the three phases though being more common in the development stage associated with F2B a situation that is consistent with the interpretation of its essentially diagenetic instead of depositional nature see 7 Diagenesis and 8 Discussion An addi tional observation is that sometimes at the top of F2B 2BT intervals siliceous layers nodules occur resembling a thin cap over the struc tures which seems to be consistent with cessation of growth of the latter and silica precipitation due to sudden pH change Assuming that interpretation on facies regarding thickness of water column is correct the cyclical facies pattern intervals could also partially represent cyclical shallowing deepening episodes of the lake system However as stated other factors namely geochemical balance fluctuations and climatic modes are also considered to have been rele vant in controlling the development of these unconventional carbonate facies therefore a direct link to shallowing deepening cycles may not unequivocally be established here What seems unequivocal is the ex istence of a cyclical facies pattern in the studied carbonate deposits These interpretations are in agreement with previous works where cyclothems in the Barra Velha carbonates and in its equivalent in the Campos basin were recognized though with some differences among the several authors concerning cyclothem components and cycle interpre tation Wright and Barnett 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Faria et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Wright 2019 Gomes et al 2020 The basic cyclothems identified in previous works have in common a dominance of shrubs within the upper part of the elementary cyclothem a facies arrangement termed Upward increasing shrub pattern by Gomes et al 2020 The latter authors mentioned that a key feature of the Upwar d increasing shrub pattern is an irregular surface above whereas Wright and Barnett 2015 refer that the in situ shrubs at the top of the cyclothems may be separated by a thin grainstone composed mainly of re worked shrubs although the underlying shrubs rarely show any ev idence of truncation and erosion In this study rare similar cases were found namely a grainstone made of shrub clasts F3 truncated by an irregular surface draped by a crust like horizon in turn partially broken and overlain by F2 fragments locally collapsed 7 Diagenesis The restrictions in data availability prevents a comprehensive and analytically supported diagenetic interpretation of the studied carbon ate rocks to be made which is clearly a limitation here However petrographic studies give clues to the main processes having affected the successions and in particular to their impact on reservoir rock features Therefore identification and description of diagenetic processes and products is relevant to add knowledge on these reservoirs regardless of missing analytical data namely on fluid origins and geochemical con ditions themselves Though definition of a diagenetic paragenetic sequence is inhibited highlighting the influence of diagenesis is crucial and it is the aim of the present approach The effects of diagenetic processes show variable development along each well studied intervals and between both wells These processes are cementation common in both wells dolomitization common but variable dedolomitization uncommon recrystallization common but seldom pervasive silicification common but in thin intervals compaction uncommon fracturing common in Well 1 rare in Well 2 brecciation rare and dissolution common and often intense in both wells In the perspective of reservoir rocks obviously dissolution creating or enhancing secondary porosity is a fundamental process and it will be addressed in more detail From petrographic examination it stands out that several phases of corrosion must have operated but due to lack of other data dissolution and its currently observed overall effects will be treated here as an overarching mechanism and the distinction and possible timing of different phases will not be considered further 7 1 Cementation In both cores cementation is unevenly distributed in most facies though cement is naturally better identifiable in the grain supported facies Figs 8 A 9 A F 11 A C it may be difficult sometimes to differentiate it from void infilling material Figs 6 D and F 7 B Ce ments correspond to micrite clayey micrite dolomitic rhombic mosaics or microcrystalline locally crypto to mesocrystalline siliceous mo saics very locally pendant calcitic cement was identified in association with oncoidal particles of F6 The almost complete lack of spar cement is a noteworthy feature of these rocks very locally microspar is observed when the inter granular carbonate material is not micritic but micro to mesocrystalline it is usually composed of dolomite euhedral to sub hedral rhombs or larger mosaic calcite crystals Very locally it was possible to identify a first generation of circum granular bladed cement dolomite after calcite followed by rhombic dolomite spread over void space and shrubby material Fig 8 C 7 2 Dolomitization dedolomitization As described dolomitic crystals euhedral to subhedral rhombs are common appearing either as spread over void space and facies elements themselves namely in F2A and F2B or as bounding or residual inter stitial material which is difficult to define as primary cement or diagenetic dolomitized sediment matrix a particular case is the mentioned example of circum granular bladed cement dolomite after calcite shown in Fig 8 C Dolomite is more often associated with F2A F2B F3 F4 and F5 and it is more common in core from Well 2 than in core from Well 1 Locally isolated particles may be dolomitized The apparent impact of dolomite in porosity is varied as it may either fill previous void spaces or in contrast when forming bridges and floating chains of rhombs be apparently associated with conditions favouring high porosity devel opment that would have left the dolomite as residual non dissolved material Figs 8 D and 11 F Locally dolomitic limestone of entirely crystalline texture occurs 16

of a continuum of mostly in situ deterioration of the original shrubby structures Figs 7 C D and 12 C In fact though at quick core scale examination it is not obvious coupling core and thin section high resolution analysis a ghost frame work texture was recognized In spite of the highly porous very deli cate lacy aspect of the rocks here labelled lacy F2B cryptic fabric resembling faint outlines of a linked and branching morphology is perceived locally even a few remaining internal shrubby morphologies Fig 12 C suggesting it to be a residual texture from an originally connected framework that is former in situ development of shrubbylike structures these may be dolomitized or not with a crumbled aspect The F2B quasi F3 refers to close but less clear fabric patterns produced by dissolution followed by some spalling and collapse disaggregation into pieces processes mixed shrub clasts partially broken collapsed fragments of shrubby material may occur and also bridges made of micrite F2A laminae and dolomite rhombs these sometimes appearing to float in void space This rock fabric looks closer to grain dominated carbonates having closer textural affinity with F3 thus the chosen term F2B quasi F3 Fig 12 A and B Further devel opment leads to a ghost framework where the remnants appear as clasts thus forming a residual fabric resembling a grain supported one F3 Facies 3 as described corresponds to apparently grain supported limestones namely intraclastic grainstones packstones whose clasts are mostly accumulated F2B collapsed structure and remains with no or incipient reworking plus a few more clearly grainy material intraclasts and also may exhibit bridges between the main fabric elements Shrub origin of the most of the material is clear It is also commonly affected by dissolution processes exhibiting high porosity the commonly rounded outline of grain pore walls argues against mechanical breaking and redeposition being a relevant process In fact a transitional suite from F2B to lacy F2B and or to F2B quasi F3 and to F3 is clearly identified in the studied rocks after detailed high resolution examination Fig 12A F There are very common examples of gradual lateral and vertical small scale transitions covering the range F2B lacy F2B F2B quasi F3 F3 Figs 7 B E and F 12 A B E F or directly from F2B into F3 virtually without displacement Fig 12 D Furthermore at core scale it is also highly common to see interbedded and interwoven levels of F2B F2BT and F3 facies types Therefore collating all the evidence it is here suggested that these fabrics have been formed mainly through shrub dissolution disintegration and locally collapse with almost in situ or near by redeposition coupled with minor input of more reworked intraclasts the latter in the case of F3 So these facies types are considered as totally lacy F2B F2B quasi F3 or mostly F3 an inherited residual fabric of F2B diagenetically modified lacy F2B F2B quasi F3 and or accumulated F3 This process is commonly recognized throughout both cores but usually it is not markedly pervasive it occurs either as irregular outlined individual zones or bands Fig 8 B more rarely in a disseminated manner across the bulk rock mass 7 4 Silicification In both cores siliceous occurrences are very common in varied forms especially as nodules or layers with F2A Fig 4 E and F2B Fig 8 A as microcrystalline cement in F3 F5 and F6 Figs 9 C F and 11 B laminae or layers in F1 and F4 as silicified spherulites Fig 9 C and D However as mentioned in some cases it is not possible to be sure whether it was precipitated as siliceous cement or resulted from silici fication of previous carbonate cement When there is a clear zone around grains contrasting in size and morphology with crystals in remaining intergranular space it suggests that there was a precursor circumgranular cement later silicified There may be microcrystalline silica infilling intraparticle porosity Fig 9 E and F A particular aspect to be highlighted is the fact that siliceous bands nodules occur often over the top of F2B 2BT dominated intervals resembling a thin cap that drapes the previous structures which suggests periodic sudden pH changes see also 5 Palaeoenvironmental interpretation and 6 Facies associations 7 5 Compaction fracturing brecciation Compaction record is not significant in the studied material This process is somewhat more common in core from Well 1 than in core from Well 2 but it is never strong and almost exclusively restricted to mechanical compaction evidence affecting mainly the laminated argillaceous limestones of F1 and grainier lithologies as in F3 F4 F5 and F6 This is evidenced in F1 by crinckled argillaceous carbonate laminae Fig 4 B that when siliceous nodules or bands occur are wrapped around them and in the other facies by tight grain arrange ments concave convex and long grain contacts slightly deformed grains and rarer sutured contacts Figs 8 F 11 D and E Fracturing is impor tant in Well 1 core in which several families of fractures were observed most of them totally or partially open In Well 2 core fracturing is much less significant with fractures usually closed by silica or carbonate precipitates Similarly brecciation aspects occur more in Well 1 core with low to moderate expression mainly in F3 F5 and F6 rarely in F2B 7 6 Dissolution Dissolution processes have highly impacted the rocks from both cores as shown by very common macro to microscopic evidence of their effects with variable corrosion intensity mostly moderate to high more rarely low This is the most important cause of diagenetic transformation of original facies creating diagenetic and depositional diagenetic hybrid facies which result in different reservoir facies properties because pore system characteristics are modified Dissolution leading to macroscopically and microscopically visible porosity has preferentially developed in facies F2A F2B F2BT and F3 Figs 4 D 6 E 7 B F 8 A and D 12 A F less commonly in F2B2 Fig 7 A the facies F1 F4 F5 were less susceptible to dissolution like F6 with local exceptions Fig 11 C A synthesis of the main porosity types occurring in each of the identified facies is presented in Fig 13 According to the present study specific some unusual fabrics were created through very intense corrosional effects on the shrub facies as addressed below 8 Discussion As stated the complex and unusual Brazilian lacustrine Pre Salt carbonates are still under intense discussion due to the unknown na ture of a range of textures

new models but to contribute to the knowledge and recognition of unsolved questions on these car bonates using the pieces of information that were made available to this study In particular two aspects are addressed here i the termino logical problems arising from equivocal origin of main facies types F2 and ii the depositional versus diagenetic nature of singular facies types As regards to the laminar carbonate composing F2A it clearly differs from the argillaceous mudstones of F1 the latter show incipient to 7 6 1 Particular dissolution related textures At certain intervals of the studied cores dissolution has very strongly affected F2B in an even more particular way according to interpretation in this study resulting in specific textural varieties considered as 18

A C Azere do et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 108 2021 103202 Fig 13 Distribution of the main porosity types in the different facies defined in this work marked sub millimetric laminae most of which clearly formed physi cally by the silt and clay sedimentation with minor occurrence of small spherulites and the rock appears tight and compact In F2A the laminae are more irregular in morphology and thickness often crenulated and exhibiting inter and intralaminae porosity overall resembling tradi tional tabular dominated stromatolite fabrics However no unequivocal sign of microbial related structures like filaments or cyanobacteria were recognized in this facies as for instance is documented in similar de posits of the Campos Basin by Muniz and Bosence 2015 For the Santos Basin Wright and Barnett 2015 also state that demonstrable microbial macro and microstructures are very rare in the Barra Velha Formation as a whole comprising 1 of its thickness With the data available for the present study a conclusive opinion on the microbial versus non microbial origin of F2A is inhibited it is also not possible to rule out an obvious third hypothesis that of a hybrid genesis Therefore the classification terminology to apply to these car bonates remains a problem for the time being justifying the option here for referring them as in situ formed laminar stromatolitic like struc tures meaning that they could be grown and or bounded either chemically and or organically microbially Regarding Facies 2B the subject is much more complex and whether the shrub genesis is biotic non biotic or both is an issue that is beyond the scope of this study as already stated In broad terms carbonate shrub structures were recorded in different depositional contexts under a range of designations as summarized by Erthal et al 2017 However the special features and degree of development of the Pre Salt shrubs have no known analogue According to Chafetz and Guidry 1999 bacterial shrubs show very irregular forms with outlines resembling common bushes whereas crystal shrubs along with crystalline calcite fans ray crystal crusts exhibit more geometric patterns but the same authors admit that the morphologies reflect the dominant biotic or non biotic process with both bacterial induced and abiotic precipitation involved Rainey and Jones 2009 point to the likelihood that such differences between an abiotic and biotic influence depend on the in teractions of hydrodynamics of the fluid movement saturation levels and growth rates Rapid precipitation from highly saturated solutions may favour abiotic processes but where rates are lower microbial in teractions become more important On the other hand the calcite crystal pattern of stacked bands perpendicular to shrub upward growth axis is regarded by Saller et al 2016 as indicating a microbial photic oriented growth The examined material seems closer to the crystal shrubs than to the bacterial shrubs of Chafetz and Guidry 1999 the cases of more planar crust like layers of calcite crystals separated by micrite linings may be roughly compared with the ray crystal crusts of Chafetz and Guidry 1999 Wright and Barnett 2015 stressed the very close morphological resemblance of the Pre Salt crystal shrubs to those commonly found in travertine deposits though not implying a travertine origin in turn resembling the crystal shrubs of Chafetz and Guidry 1999 An obvious result of this uncertainty concerning the nature and genetic mechanisms leading to this prominent shrub facies is the ter minology to be applied to its textural classification If dominant mi crobial origin is accepted these carbonates may be considered as organically bounded in situ fitting into the traditional Dunham 1962 definition of boundstones being specifically named microbial boundstones However if no unequivocal evidence for organic origin can be proven and or if the abiotic hypotheses are favoured they are not rigorously boundstones alternative terms could be the pseudo bound stones or precipitated boundstones of Della Porta 2015 and the cementstones of Wright 1992 In particular taking for more specific comparison the terminologies recently proposed for these Barra Velha carbonate facies the F2B of this work fits well into the term shrubstones very recently coined by Gomes et al 2020 and is equivalent to the F1 F1a with Mg silicate matrix or porous respectively of Wright and Barnett 2017a The facies subtypes here named lacy F2B and F2B quasi F3 were never observed by the authors in previous studies on other sectors of the Santos Basin neither are they documented as particular types in the published literature of the Brazil Pre Salt carbonates to the authors knowledge though high porosity shrubby textures are common e g Terra et al 2009 Rezende and Pope 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 Wright and Barnett 2017a 2020 Farias et al 2019 Gomes et al 2020 The F3 in general is broadly similar to previously referred grainstones and packstones but its close link with F2B and mainly diagenetic origin is a novel interpretation here This is in contrast to previous works that regarded these grain supported facies as entirely resulting from reworking of the shrub units and deposition of the resultant clast material In fact from this study it is believed that facies F3 corresponds to apparently conventional intraclastic grainstones packstones but whose clasts are mostly F2B collapsed structure and remains with no or incipient reworking plus a few more clearly grainy material intraclasts This stands out more clearly either by cases where a transition is clearly seen directly from F2B into F3 virtually without displacement Moreover those carbonates are closely associated also with the previously undocumented facies lacy F2B highly porous keeping a faint ghost fabric of a linked and branching morphology suggesting dissolution of an originally in situ development of shrubby like framework and the F2B quasi F3 similar but with less clearly shrubby original structure and exhibiting some amalgamated remains of F2B All these types may show bridges between the main structures made of micrite F2A laminae and dolomite rhombs which sometimes appear to float in void space suggesting that they are a residue of a more extensive interstitial matrix material All the described features suggest that these textural types are mostly diagenetic with a minor depositional component Overall it is proposed that lacy F2B F2B quasi F3 and F3 represent a diagenetic continuum from completely diagenetic to mostly diagenetic with a minor depositional component The depositional and diagenetically modified products resulting from each stage exhibit different pore system network features which 20

A C Azere do et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 108 2021 103202 may be relevant for petrophysical characterization of these reservoir rocks Fig 14 In a study of Pre Salt carbonate units from Santos Basin Rezende and Pope 2015 concluded that the size of shrubs and changes in pore throat size affect permeability whereas shrub size sorting affects porosity and when poorly sorted also permeability because of pore system tortuosity According to Tosca and Wright 2015 and Wright and Barnett 2017a much of the porosity of these reservoirs is inter preted as owing to the dissolution of former Mg silicate clays which does not contradict the hypothesis here adopted of some of the apparent different facies actually just corresponding to the variable expression of different diagenetic stages mainly of dissolution processes impacting heterogeneously on same or very similar depositional facies Whereas previous authors have especially focused on the preexistence or not of a labile matrix namely in shrub facies the novel point here is on the diagenetic modifications of the shrubby structures themselves resulting in macro and especially microfabric variations and potentially pro ducing different types of reservoir facies The best potential reservoir rocks considering the observed core and petrographic characteristics correspond to some of the depositional facies F2B F2BT and F2A and to these mostly diagenetic facies lacy F2B F2B quasi F3 and F3 The identified facies types and subtypes their assignment to deposi tional and diagenetic nature and potential reservoir quality in terms of porosity as examined in this study are summarized in Fig 14 partial broken amalgamated collapsed fragments of the shrubby material Facies 3 F3 Intraclastic grainstones packstones whose clasts are mostly F2B remnants Facies 4 F4 Spherulitic grainstones packstones Facies 5 F5 Intraclastic grainstones and packstones Facies 6 F6 Oncoidal grainstones rudstones and packstones floatstones 2 Palaeoenvironmental interpretation of the facies for the studied sector fits into the shallow low gradient alkaline lake model The laminar crust shaped facies are regarded as reflecting the shallowest lake level in general and the marginal zones when flooding increased the water column but with no clear subaerial exposure evidence a charophyte occurrence here documented for the first time in the Pre Salt carbonates is consistent with the inferred lacustrine environment The oncoidal facies also corresponds to very shallow waters with very local exposure probably small marginal channels and or localized lenses within the wider lacustrine system The well developed shrubs suggest a thicker water column with enough available space for those structures to grow without trun cation or exposure besides the likely water chemistry control The packstone and grainstones made mostly of reworked shrubs depos ited in similar depth but higher energy conditions whereas the clayey calcimudstone represent the deepest more distal facies of the lacustrine setting though not very deep neither with evidence for significant slope or abrupt gradient changes The spherulite domi nated facies are not so common in the studied cores as usually in the Pre Salt The existence of spherulite interspersed in the other facies and with micrite oncoidal coatings assumed as shallow water sedi ments suggests that the spherulitic particles themselves may form at the same conditions of those other facies but when exclusive as in F4 they must represent a significant change Thus it is not clear to assigned them to a depth location but more likely to hydrochemical changes in the system 3 Facies patterns and transitions along the cores suggest depositional rhythms in non uniform cyclical intervals These cyclical patterns are usually as follows Facies 2A laminar carbonate layers is suc ceeded by strong development of the columnar shrubby structures of Facies 2B 2BT and F2B2 Heterogeneous intercalation of the other facies F1 F4 F5 and F6 occur These cyclical patterns are here interpreted as evidencing three main basic stages of facies deposi tion development probably controlled by both depth and water chemistry an initial stage St1 in which the laminar facies domi nates succeeded or not by a transitional or separating stage St2 corresponding to intercalation of facies other than F2A and F2B and a growing or development stage St3 giving birth to the exuberant shrubby structures 4 Identification of depositional facies and diagenetic or essentially diagenetic facies is made for these reservoirs that is facies that were originally similar and developed in similar depositional con ditions but now show different fabrics because were differently impacted by diagenesis These essentially diagenetic facies are lacy F2B F2B quasi F3 and F3 which together with some of the depositional ones F2B F2BT and F2A define the best reservoir facies The pore system network differs between F2BT and lacy F2B with usually larger size pores in F2BT and higher tortuosity in lacy F2B The small well sorted shrubs of F2B2 form a tighter lower porosity texture with straight channel pores Therefore recognition and distinguishing among these facies may be useful as guidance for petrophysical assessment of the reservoirs 5 If the interpretations in this study are correct they i reinforce existing datasets to improve understanding of these facies ii raise caution concerning some facies previously considered as separate depositional products which in fact may not be the case but instead result from a spectrum of diagenetic modifications iii stress the relevance of microfacies analysis and diagenetic petrography to help 9 Summary and conclusions 1 Six facies plus six subtypes have been identified in carbonates from two wells on the informally named Pre Salt of the Santos Basin offshore Brazil based on detailed microscale analysis coupled with the macroscale core study The facies which have been classified independently from existing descriptions and proposed terminol ogies of other authors for other wells and sectors of the basin are as follows Facies 1 F1 Argillaceous limestone with incipient to marked lamination Facies 2 F2 In situ grown carbonates with a range of singular morphologies This is subdivided into F2A clearly laminated including stromatolitic like fabric F2B shrubs in turn differen tiated in subtypes F2BT robust exuberant shrub structures F2B2 micro shrubs lacy F2B highly porous delicate lace like fabric and F2B quasi F3 some similar structures mixed with Fig 14 Summary of the depositional versus diagenetic nature of the facies types identified in this study and their potential reservoir quality judged only by visual analysis of porosity features and deduced dissolution susceptibility Colour code for porosity degree is the same in key of Fig 3 For colour in this figure the reader is referred to the Web

phase and amplitude envelope combined with well data and the inversion techniques for the delimitation and the characterization of a complex reservoir system from the tertiary turbidite channels located in the Lower Basin of Congo Artificial intelligence can also support the use of seismic attributes in reservoir identification and prediction of the environment of deposition Obafemi et al 2020 integrated two lith ofacies and fluid discriminating seismic attributes via an unsupervised artificial neural network to characterize the architecture of deepwater turbidite channels and submarine fan lobes across a hydrocarbon bearing reservoir within the Frem Field in the Niger Delta Souza 2021 characterized the southeast portion of the hydrocarbon producer basin of Taranaki New Zealand This research is anchored in two independent attributes curvature and coherence which proved efficient in delineating structural and stratigraphic discontinuities such as channels faults and fractures and seismic facies The use of multi attributes enhances and accelerates the process of seismic interpretation In the Campos Basin Schmidt 2013 employed Maximum Ampli tude Maximum Magnitude e RMS Amplitude to characterize the car bonate reservoir of the Bonito Field Considering the heterogeneous carbonate rocks from the Brazilian pre salt layers the amplitude attri butes provided the most distinguishable seismic response To the south of the Santos Basin the use of instantaneous seismic attributes such as envelope phase and instantaneous frequency has facilitated the inter pretation of 2D post stack seismic sections leading to the identification of gas hydrate indicators in the Pelotas Basin Dias et al 2019 In the central part of the Santos Basin multiple seismic attributes combined with machine learning algorithms are used to identify strati fications within the salt layer showing that the correct facies identifi cation allows adjusting the drilling parameters accordingly to the estimated salt type minimizing operational problems and economic losses Mesquita et al 2021 Ferreira et al 2021 propose using an unsupervised artificial neural network algorithm to perform seismic facies classification in the Búzios Field This research was based on a unique combination of stratigraphic and structural attributes local flatness principal dip component acoustic impedance and RMS amplitude The latter two attributes were essential for the delimitation of the carbonate platform facies while the first and second ones were essential to discriminate the debris and build up facies As the vast majority of recent studies focus solely on the reservoir of the Búzios Field there is a noticeable lack of published research con cerning the stratigraphic geometric and spatial relationships of the other units that comprise the geological framework of this area Therefore this research aims to address this gap by examining the comprehensive geological framework of the region encompassing various units and their interconnections This broad approach will contribute to a more thorough understanding of the geological evolution and potential reservoir characteristics in the Búzios Field area In this case this study proposes a three dimensional investigation of the features observed throughout the geological framework of the Santos Basin in the Búzios Field area In this paper we propose a quantitative and qualitative classification of seismic facies using multi attribute analysis allied to the integration of well logs in the Búzios Field to characterize three dimensionally the geological framework of the area within the Santos Basin The study also aims to reconstitute the basin s tectonostratigraphic evolution in the context of the South Atlantic Ocean opening by unraveling the relationship between the geological units and its seismic response This research has the potential to contribute to the future development of more concise predictive and detailed geological models for oil exploration in the basin 2 Location and geological framework The Santos Basin Fig 1 is a passive margin basin related to the Gondwana breakup event during the Neocominian The tectonic evo lution of this basin is divided into three mega sequences rift post rift sag and drift presented in Fig 2 Mio et al 2005 Moreira et al 2007 The Camboriú Piçarras and Itapema formations represent the rift stage related to the separation of South American and African paleocontinents during the end of Neocomian and the beginning of Aptian and are responsible for initiating the lacustrine deposition Moreira et al 2007 The post rift or sag sequence represents a transitional stage from continental to marine environment with softer tectonics during the Aptian Moreira et al 2007 This transitional stage is represented by the non marine and shallow water carbonates of the Barra Velha For mation and the thick overlying evaporite seal of the Ariri Formation Buckley et al 2015 The last phase of the Santos Basin evolution is the continental drift responsible for the installation of a well established basin associated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean since the Albian Moreira et al 2007 This mega sequence is related to thermal subsidence associated with halokinesis and is subdivided into three sequences deposited dur ing a progressive increase of the basin depth the Camburi Frade and Itamambuca groups The first one is a result of the rising sea level and is represented by the lower Floriano polis Guaruja and lower Itanhae m formations The Frade Group represents a marine regression stage where the coastline has advanced up to 200 km towards the continent The end of the drift phase is marked by the prograding system of the Itamambuca Group with expressive development of clinoforms of slope and the advance of the platform break up Milani et al 2000 Moreira et al 2007 Papaterra 2010 The Búzios Field located in the central portion of the Santos Basin Fig 1 is one of the most productive fields in the area In the Búzios Field area the rift mega sequence begins with the extrusion of the Camboriú Formation continental basalts which are interlayered with volcaniclastic rocks as shown in composite log registers 3 BRSA 1053RJS The rift mega sequence is heavily influenced by tectonics and is divided into upper and lower sequences The lower sequence is char acterized by the Piçarras Formation which exhibits the greatest devel opment of sedimentary wedges with thickening towards the hanging wall reaching thicknesses of up to 2200 m The upper sequence corre sponds to the Itapema Formation which includes the coquinas sec tion consisting of a thick package up to 300 m of bivalve rudstones and to a lesser extent bioclastic grainstones packstones wackstones mudstones and shales that were deposited in high energy environments Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 Regarding the post rift mega sequence the carbonates of the Barra Velha Formation in the Búzios Field occur in various facies such as Mgrich clays stevensite shrubs spherulites and fine grained carbonates These carbonates range in thickness from approximately 200 to 400 m at structural highs Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 Ferreira 2022 The basal and upper portions of the Barra Velha Formation are domi nated by fine grained carbonate sediments while intermediate portion is dominated by in situ carbonate sedimentation with shrubs and 3

F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Horizon 2 shown in orange in Figs 4 and 5 delineates the upper boundary of Unit B This surface occurs at an average depth of 5950 m Unit B is characterized by a pattern of reflectors that range from divergent or oblique parallel to locally chaotic at the footwalls base with high amplitude medium to low illumination and intermediate lateral continuity Fig 4 A and B It displays a wedge shaped geometry In areas where the horsts of Unit A are located there is a decrease in layer thickness Regarding seismic attributes the instantaneous amplitude does not exhibit a well defined pattern but dark features parallel to the base of the unit horizon 1 are observed interleaved with a white chaotic re gion Feature 2 in Fig 5 A The instantaneous phase attribute distin guishes units A and B well with a change from a chaotic pattern to a divergent and oblique parallel one that evidences good lateral continuity of the reflectors Feature 3 in Fig 5 B Unit B predominantly displays high sweetness in dark blue with minor intercalations of low sweetness in yellow to red parallel to the top of the unit horizon 2 Fig 5 C Semblance is predominantly high and highlights the reflectors diver gent pattern and inclination Fig 5 D Unit C is bounded at the top by horizon 3 shown in green in Figs 4 and 5 which occurs at an average depth of 5700 m This unit is sepa rated from Unit B by a significant discontinuity which marks the change in the divergent pattern to a planar parallel one Fig 4 A and B The surface used as the base marker is a horizon with very high illumination and negative amplitude where an onlapping feature is observed Another important feature is the occurrence of mounds at the top of the unit Instantaneous amplitude and sweetness do not provide a clear response for this unit resulting in a highly homogeneous pattern Fig 5A and B The instantaneous phase shows a discrete change in pattern compared to Unit B marked by an increase in bed thickness expressed by the increase of the distance between two consecutive reflectors Fig 5 C Semblance exhibits a gradual change from planar parallel white to chaotic dark blue black patterns toward the N NW The white portion of high similarity indicates a homogeneous composition while the dark portion indicates abrupt structural variation Feature 4 in Fig 5 D The top of Unit D is marked by Horizon 4 in blue in Figs 4 and 5 This horizon ranges in depth from 2490 m to 6330 m with an average depth of 3550 m The thickness of this unit decreases towards the NW resulting in direct contact between units C and F Feature 5 in Fig 4 B The seismic response of this unit is highly heterogeneous displaying three main patterns without stratification Feature 6 in Fig 4 B with little marked stratification Feature 7 in Fig 4 B and with well marked stratification Feature 8 in Fig 4 B The deepest domain lacks stratifi cation and has chaotic to absent reflectors The intermediate domain typically exhibits a chaotic to wavy seismic pattern with weak stratifi cation while the shallowest domain has well marked stratification characterized by wavy to plane parallel reflectors high amplitude high illumination and low lateral continuity Generally the stratification of this unit is parallel to the irregular surface of its top Instantaneous amplitude strongly emphasizes Horizon 4 revealing a well marked dark surface indicating an abrupt lithologic variation Fig 5 A This attribute also confirms the existence of a stratified portion at the top of Unit D as shown by the alternation of wavy dark and light regions The domain without stratification is marked by a relatively homogeneous white pattern resulting in low amplitude en velope values The instantaneous phase attribute effectively highlights the domain without stratification due to its chaotic pattern and lack of continuity Fig 5 B The domain with well marked stratification dis plays intermediate to good lateral continuity Instantaneous sweetness highlights a chaotic pattern with low to medium sweetness in the center of Unit D contoured by layers with high sweetness parallel to Horizon 4 Feature 9 in Fig 5 C Semblance provides visualization of stratified areas adjacent to the top highlighted by light blue to white segments in the flanks of antiforms and black in the hinges Fig 5 D Horizon 5 dark blue in Figs 4 and 5 marks the top of Unit E which surface ranges in depth from 2910 m to 4290 m with an average depth of 3290 m This unit displays a heterogeneous seismic pattern charac terized by intermediate amplitude and illumination but high lateral continuity Fig 4 A and B Near the base the reflectors tend to follow the underlying unit topography and fill mini basins between the Unit D domes Feature 10 in Fig 4 B In these regions the unit exhibits a wavy pattern with onlapping terminations where reflectors are thick at the depocentre and thinner as it moves away from the center On the steepest slopes Unit E has a chaotic pattern while towards the top the reflectors are plane parallel Interweaved mound like features with wavy to plane parallel internal reflectors Fig 6 occur in the north portion of the study area The unit is generally intensely deformed and crossed by multiple sets of normal faults The instantaneous amplitude attribute reveals the existence of expressive surfaces marked by black color parallel to the unit stratifi cation and a mound shaped feature in the north Feature 11 in Fig 5 A The instantaneous phase effectively enhances the wavy to plane parallel pattern and the high lateral continuity of the reflectors Next to the base of the hanging walls this attribute shows a chaotic pattern Feature 12 in Fig 5 B Sweetness shows the intercalation of thick layers of high medium and low sweetness at the top and a heterogeneous pattern composed of medium to low sweetness where the mound like features occur Fig 5 C Semblance also reveals the plane parallel and wavy patterns but it highlights little disruption marked by dark patches into the medium to high semblance reflectors Feature 13 in Fig 5 D Seismic unit F is characterized by a parallel configuration with wellmarked flat reflectors that exhibit a plane parallel configuration high illumination low amplitude and high lateral continuity Fig 4 A and B It differs from the underlying unit E by the intensity of deformation An important feature observed throughout the study area is an erosive surface at the top of Unit E at depths lower than 2500 m Feature 14 in Fig 4 A This surface is curved and locally undulated and is marked by an abrupt disruption of reflectors The instantaneous amplitude better discriminates between units E and F with the latter presenting a homogeneous plane parallel pattern marked by alternating high black medium grey and low white reflectivity This attribute also reveals the great lateral continuity and relatively constant thickness of layers Feature 15 in Fig 5 A The instantaneous phase attribute highlights the great lateral continuity and distinguishes units E and F by the decrease of reflector thickness in the latter Fig 5 B Moreover sweetness shows a distinct intercalation of thin layers of high medium and low sweetness Fig 5 C Semblance outlines the plane parallel pattern predominantly formed by white layers high similarity with dark areas around faults and structural highs of Unit D Feature 16 in Fig 5 D Fig 7 summarizes the six aforementioned seismic patterns where the main characteristics of each unit are presented with their respective instantaneous amplitude instantaneous phase sweetness and semblance attributes 4 2 Analysis of the identified structures The studied area can be divided into two structural domains deep and shallow ones separated by horizon 3 Figs 8 and 9 respectively Both domains consist of normal faults in which the deep structures display NE SW azimuth roughly parallel to the Brazilian coastline and dip between 50 and 80 and the shallow structures have E W to NW SE azimuth and dip between 30 and 60 The deep structures consist of five main normal faults with curved surfaces which occur below 5000 m depth In the 3D model they are discriminated by different colors green pink red dark blue and yellow Fig 8 Two main faults are N S trending green and pink ones dipping about 50 60 to W and occurs in the central portion of the Búzios Field In the NE region of the study area the pink fault is deflected towards NESW and its dip angle decrease The red fault trends to the NE SW di rection and dips 60 80 to NW The fault represented in dark blue also 8

E When the Unit D lows overlap with fault zones the thickness of this package usually in creases significantly reaching up to 1800 m period of basin evolution characterized by mechanical extension It is also reflected in stratigraphic features that indicate syn depositional fault movement The post rift term denotes any strata that form after the active extensional tectonics Based on the evidence of the initial stages of the rifting process such as grabens and half grabens Unit A was classified as Syn Rift I phase It is important to note that volcanic rocks can also represent a pre rift stage such as in the Southern Red Sea Yemen where an astheno spheric plume occurs cf Mitchell et al 1992 Unit B also displays seismic patterns consistent with syn rift tec tonics as demonstrated by Prosser 1993 Fig 17 and we interpreted it as a Syn Rift II stage In the study area these features take the form of wedge shaped geometry created by divergent reflectors with an oblique parallel configuration Fig 18 Additionally the portions of Unit B that exhibit the divergent and oblique parallel pattern with the classic wedge shaped configuration may represent the initiation of the rift The divergence of reflectors may be a consequence of syn tectonic deposition Kuchle 2010 The chaotic pattern observed near the base of the footwall slope can be associated with the climax stage and suggests aggradation Unit C was interpreted as a Post Rift I stage due to the change from the divergent to a plane parallel pattern indicating the transition from syn rift to post rift phase according to Bosence 1998 In the post rift phase the filling of the basin is characterized by aggradational and progradational geometries which surfaces dip in the direction of the increase of the accommodation space in the center of the basin The horizontal and plane parallel configuration of Unit C reflectors could represent a reflex of its deposition after intense tectonic activity Kuchle 2010 Although the base of Unit C is affected by some of the normal faults it was not interpreted as a part of the syn rift section This feature was considered a posterior reactivation of the syn rift faulting Macedo et al 2021 argue the faults that affect the top of the post rift or sag section indicate the tectonic activity is at least locally controlling the post rift sedimentation in the Búzios Field area Unit D was interpreted as the saline section of the Santos Basin representing a Post Rift II stage This unit was interpreted as post rift once it was not affected by the normal faults associated with the rift phase Mitchell et al 1992 describe syn rift evaporites Red Sea Yemen where the salt section is intensely controlled by the rift faults contrary to what we observed in the study area The

units in the context of a marine rift basin and its tectonic components To incorporate the interpreted seismic units into the geological his tory of the Santos Basin it is necessary to correlate these

F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 the upper portion is covered by the base of the salt layer horizon 3 it is reasonable to suggest the presence of oil at the top of the Barra Velha Formation at the locations of 8 BUZ 26 RJS and 8 BUZ 28DA RJS wells According to Tavares da Silva and Gordon 2021 these carbonates display variable amplitude and small scale progradation are rarely affected by faults and exhibit common features such as carbonate ramps and mounds deposited preferentially onto preexisting basement highs These features are consistent with the ones observed in the study area such as sub parallel to parallel reflectors with mound geometries at the top of Unit C The sub parallel to the parallel pattern can be associated with the aggradational flat topped carbonate platform described in Buckley et al 2015 while the mounds are associated with carbonate build up facies see Ferreira et al 2021 Note that all the analyzed curves exhibit an abrupt change in the pattern when passing from Post Rift I to Post Rift II units Probably this is a consequence of a considerable change in the lithology This is related to an unconformity that separates the carbonate sequence from the evaporite one Buckley et al 2015 Therefore the Post Rift II unit represents the transition between the sag and transitional environment deposited within a high evaporation rate lake associated with periodic marine transgressions in the Neo Aptian Gambo a et al 2008 The argument of a transition from carbonate to evaporite composition is consistent once there is a considerable decrease in density and a slight increase of the P sonic values This is an expected behavior since the mean P wave velocity of halite the major component of the saline section in the Búzios Field is 4549 m s and its density is 2 03 g cm3 Mohriak et al 2008 in Justen et al 2013 Well logs from the Post Rift II unit provided values of density average mean from 2 06 to 2 17 g cm3 and P sonic average mean next to 68 us ft Vp 4504 m s Regarding the gamma ray logs the Post Rift II unit has the lowest values however it also exhibits some intercalated peaks of high signal The intercalation of high value peaks in the upper part of the Post Rift II unit is ascribed to the stratification of different types of salt similar to the Evident Strati fication Domain ESD proposed by Maul et al 2018 The extremely high GR values 200 GAPI are assigned to the presence of sylvite due to the potassium concentration Therefore Unit D is equivalent to the Ariri Formation At the base of the Drift I unit horizon 4 density is the highest and tends to decrease upwards at the same time P slowness increases This abrupt change marks the implantation of a marine environment in the Santos Basin with the deposition of the post breakup sediment packages from the Late Cretaceous to the Neogene Roughly the lower portion of the Drift I unit can be associated with the limestones from the Guaruja Formation This portion represents the installation of a carbonate plat form during the Albian The overlying package with lower density and higher slowness is assigned to a coarsening up sequence once the coarser lithology tends to be more porous which explains the decrease in density and increase of slowness VP fluids VP rock Therefore the aforementioned upper portion of the Drift I unit is associated with the intercalation of diamictites from the Itajaí Açu Formation deposited in the distal platform slope and basin environments This interval repre sents a regression phase where the limit of the platform advanced up to 200 km offshore The interweaved mound shaped feature observed at the top of the Drift I unit Fig 5 was also interpreted as gravitational flow deposits At this depth 3200 m Moreira et al 2007 describe the presence of strongly channelized sandstones resulting from dense turbidity currents Ilhabela Member related to significant excavations on the slope and platform Drift I and II units have the highest average mean of gamma ray and the lowest resistivity with the GR values being even higher for the Drift II unit The gamma ray log highlights the intercalation of portions with high and medium GR values The high gamma ray and low resistivity can be associated with the presence of the Marambaia Formation shales associated with marls once the presence of clay a highly radioactive material accommodates large amounts of interstitial water Gira o 2013 This also explains the low resistivity values once water is a conductive material and has very low resistance to electrical current Moreira et al 2007 describe the expressive occurrence of dark and radioactive shales throughout the drift mega sequence The portions with medium gamma ray values can be associated with the sandstone bodies intercalated with shales in the Marambaia Fm Interval In the context of the Santos Basin evolution the Drift II unit represents the moment when the carbonate platform reaches its greatest development in the Miocene From the Lower Miocene onwards lower order se quences undergo transgressive development that reaches its peak in the Mid Miocene Serravallian This interval marks the highest relative sea level variation from the Miocene to the present resulting in the deposition of a substantial volume of sediments Moreira et al 2007 The interweaved mound shaped feature Fig 6 observed at depths of about 2500 m was associated with gravitational deposits of the Maresias Member The surface of erosion depicted in Fig 11 possibly represents canyons infilled with mudstones or sandstones described to occur at slope portions in the Marambaia Fm shales and diamictites 5 3 The Búzios Field in the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Santos Basin 5 3 1 Comparison with the Tupi Field The Tupi Field located approximately 50 km southwestward of the Búzios Field is another giant petroleum field of the Santos Basin Fig 1 A series of comparisons can be placed between the Tupi and Búzios fields based on recent works cf Adriano et al 2022 Fig 19 Compared to the Búzios Field the Tupi Field exhibits an important NE SW thinning of the Piçarras Itapema and Barra Velha formations constrained by the Camboriú Formation high the Tupi High high lighted in Fig 19 B feature 1 Analyzing four seismic sections pre sented in Adriano et al 2022 the Barra Velha Formation is thicker than we interpreted in the study area Regarding the structures a remarkable difference is the rotation of the syn rift blocks The blocks of the Tupi Field are tilted at a higher angle where the internal reflectors are more inclined than in the study area feature 2 in Fig 19 B According to Adriano et al 2022 there are three main sets of normal faults conditioning the rift phase NE SW and N S trends faults control the Lower and Upper Rifts Camboriú Piçarras Itapema and Lower Barra Velha formations while NW SE trend conditions the Later Rift Upper Barra Velha Formation Our work mapped four main trends N S direction west dipping NE SW direction northwest dipping NE SW direction southeast dipping and W E trend dipping to north In this only the W E trend yellow fault Fig 8 crosses the Barra Velha Formation Unit C while all the others are related to units A and B coherent with the NE SW and N S trend faults described in Adriano et al 2022 5 3 2 Comparison with the Sapinhoa and Lapa fields The Sapinhoa and Lapa fields located ca 120 km southwestward of the Búzios Field also have an important role in the pre salt exploration Fig 1 Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 present the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Barra Velha Formation in the area of the Sapinhoa and Lapa fields According to interpreted sections shown in Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 Fig 20 there are remarkable differences from what was observed in our study The first and most prominent one is the geometry of the evaporite cover the Ariri Formation In the region of the Sapinhoa and Lapa the salt section is predominantly thick forming large salt walls feature 1 in Fig 20 B There is a widespread occurrence of this unit across the mapped area while in the northwest of the Búzios Fied the salt section forms windows or scars due to the intense thinning or absence of this package Besides the salt in the area of Sapinhoa and Lapa fields is more stratified and the stratification is observed in vari able depths not restricted to the top of the unit as in the Búzios Field In the interpreted NW SE section from Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 tongues of the non stratified salt are observed interfingered with 20

F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Based on these premises and the fact that the Búzios Field occupies a position closer to the continental margin than Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa we suggest that the displacement caused by rifting was smaller in the Búzios Field Fig 21 Therefore it is reasonable that the syn rift blocks are more rotated in the area of the Tupi Field once it experimented with more displacement than the Búzios area Once the displacement increased from west to east and the rifting process widened and deepened towards the south the same argument counts for the intensely mobilized and thicker salt layer in the Sapinhoa Lapa and Tupi fields area These areas are located at greater distances from the continental margin than Búzios thus experimenting with more displacement A schematic diagram Fig 22 modified from Jackson and Talbot 1991 in Gillhaus and Horvath 2008 shows the relative positions of the Búzios Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields in the context of salt maturity The thick package of the layer in Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa can be assigned to increased salt mobilization basinward due to the halokinesis Firstly it is essential to consider that the driving force for the rise of evaporite rocks through the non saline cover rock is gravity combined with density differences between the less dense salt deep underground and its more dense cover rock The autonomous vertical movement of salt is predicated upon the progressive compaction and cementation of the overlying sand clay and carbonate layers in the cover rock as a result of basin subsidence until their density is as high or higher than the density of the salt layers Local uplift of the salt mainly begins in loca tions where there are already significant horizontal lithostatic pressure gradients above or within the salt Regional lithostatic pressure gradi ents exist in areas such as the transition zones between shelves and continental slopes where the bathymetry leads to a reduction in cover rock thickness towards the center of the basin Eisbacher 1996 Langer and Schütte 2002 Gillhaus and Horvath 2008 Therefore it is ex pected that the proximal portion of the extensional basin experiments a less intense salt mobilization once the overburden package is thinner and consequently the lithostatic pressure is smaller Due to the basin ward deepening the opposite behavior occurs in the distal portion In this case the Búzios Field is more proximal to the coastline and exhibits a thinner and less mobilized salt package than occurs in Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa areas Despite the continued efforts acting on the basin during continental drift in the study area the major factor influencing the deformation of the post salt package is the salt tectonics This is concluded from the analysis of the observed structures and deformation patterns Fig 9 clearly shows the outline of salt domes and diapirs by post salt faults Although halokinesis ceased during the Eo Oligocene Corre a 2009 most of the deformation of the post salt package was conditioned by salt tectonics even though there might be a component of deformation associated with the reactivation of syn rift faults The major difference between units Drift I and II is the amount of deformation Once Drift I unit is greatly affected by the halokinesis Drift II unit is a predominantly regular package mostly affected by extensional efforts Horizon 5 which separates Drift I and II units may mark the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary tectonic reactivation which has resulted in increased salt tec tonics Meisling et al 2001 Cobbold et al 2001 This reactivation could explain the extensional faults in the throughout Drift II package since the halokinesis ceased during Eo Oligocene in the Santos Basin Corre a 2009 Regarding the pre salt section in the Sapinhoa Lapa fields the rifting faults intensely affect the Barra Velha Formation In the Búzios Field region only one of the main mapped faults affects this unit while in the Sapinhoa Field a great part of the interpreted faults crosses the entire Barra Velha package reaching out to the base of the salt The higher angle tilting of the syn rift blocks observed in the Tupi area is also explained by its position within the tectonic components of the Santos Basin The Tupi Field is located more distal from the continental margin than the Búzios area Regarding the unit s thickness the thicker Barra Velha Formation package observed in the Tupi Field may be a consequence of the southward widening of the rift where great space of accommodation was generated by the time de post rift sequence was deposited However it is important to highlight that besides de ac commodation space many parameters conditionate the carbonate pre cipitation such as climate Ph base level composition and solubility of the lake Besides that only a few sections were analyzed for this com parison thus the thickening of the Barra Velha Formation can be local and only a result of spots with a higher deposition rate By the same logic it is reasonable to infer that the Sapinhoa Lapa area also presents a thickening of the post rift sequence once it is also located eastwards of the Búzios Field In the sections shown in Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 the salt package and the Barra Velha Formation are thicker than in the Búzios Field area However it is important to high light that besides de accommodation space many parameters also conditionate the salt precipitation such as climate Ph base level composition and solubility among others of the evaporite lake In the study area four main sets of normal faults were mapped throughout the pre salt section N S direction west dipping NE SW di rection northwest dipping NE SW direction southeast dipping and W E trend dipping to north The NE SW faults are probably related to the main fracturing trend of the South Atlantic rift inherited from crystal line basement Ribeira Belt structures Stanton et al 2014 which generates the east west displacement The W E fault yellow Fig 8 can be associated with a secondary and posterior trend caused by transfer zones Mohriak and Fainstein 2012 after Asmus and Ferrari 1978 and Meisling et al 2001 point out the W E general trend suggests an oblique rift system marked by transfer zones some of which were reactivated during the formation of oceanic fracture zones At the eastern limit of continental crust transfer zones become aligned with ocean ridge transform faults which trend W E across the South Atlantic Meisling et al 2001 Stanton et al 2014 describe the presence of structural W E trends predominant at the distal domain of the Santos Basin with orientation subparallel to the South Atlantic fracture zones This association is also made by Souza et al 2007 This argument supports the hypothesis of the W E faults being posterior to the rifting fault since it affects the Post Rift I Barra Velha Fm reaching out the base of salt One of the N S fault sets pink Fig 8 is deflected to NE This deflection can be associated with the ENE to NE trending deflection of about 1000 km long described by Dehler et al 2016 and Szatmari and Milani 2016 The aforementioned feature is produced by left lateral transtensional tectonics in the rift with a strong strike slip component along NE trending faults The occurrence of volcanic intrusions in the Santos Basin has been locally described Fornero et al 2019 describe the occurrence of approximately 400 m of basaltic subaerial flows in the SE deepwater portion of the Santos Basin at about 300 km from the coast These flows were deposited during the post rift phase and were covered by the sequence of the Ariri Formation Moreover a thick and vertically ori ented intracrustal structure observed in the proximal portion of the Santos Basin is suggested as swarms of dikes with associated plugs controlled by the NE SW structures of the rift Ferraz et al 2018 However these volcanic flows were not mapped in the study area At the research scale no features suggestive of volcanic intrusions were detected but this does not necessarily mean they are absent Zala n et al 2011 point out the Santos Campos and Espírito Santo basins as a typical example of a magma poor passive margin In sharp contrast the Pelotas Basin situated in the south of the Floriano polis High is the classic example of a volcanic margin with huge rifts filled mostly by volcanic material 5 3 4 Sismostratigraphy and tectonic implications In this research we used 3D seismic attributes and well log

F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Post Rift II Drift I and Drift II respectively Based on well data units B C D E and F were correlated with the stratigraphy of the Santos Basin Unit B corresponds to the Piçarras Itapema interval while unit C is associated with the Barra Velha Formation Unit D represents the Ariri Fm and Unit E is related to the Guaruja and Itajaí Açu formations as well as the turbidites of the Ilhabela Member Finally Unit F is associ ated with the Marambaia Formation shales and the turbidity flows of the Maresias Member To generate a 3D model we interpolated five horizons 1 2 3 4 and 5 and the main faults From this model important features were observed For instance the Syn Rift I unit economic basement is deeper towards N NW whereas it is shallower towards S SE It occurs due to the presence of a half grabens system of regional expression This half graben system is responsible for conditioning the entire pre salt geometry and thickness as the structural highs and lows generate more or less space for sediment accommodation Although the Post Rift I unit has a predominantly regular geometry and constant thickness we noticed a tendency to thicken towards the S SE and a slight downward flexure towards the NE in the southeast of the Búzios Field in the 3D model An important observation from the 3D model is the complex morphology of the Post Rift II unit The unit s thickness varies from zero in the NW part of the study area to 3300 m below the steep and thick domes and diapirs Moving towards the SE the unit s topography be comes more irregular where thick anticlinal and synclinal features alternate Towards the S SE the salt layer is thicker and the domes are less steep The thickness of the Drift I unit is highly influenced by the salt morphology In areas where the salt package is thin in the north the Drift I unit is thicker reaching up to 3600 m The top surface of this unit horizon 5 is primarily flat but discontinuous due to the presence of dipslip faults Lastly the Drift II unit is characterized by a relatively con stant thickness of about 500 m with minor variations in proximity to fault zones The 3D modeling of these units allowed the observation of many features that researchers often disregarded in studies conducted in the Santos Basin Since most of these studies focus on characterizing the presalt reservoirs many morphological and structural aspects are not investigated within the rest of the basin Comparing our study area with the Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields three important differences were found the Post Rift I layer Barra Velha Fm and the Post Rift II package Ariri Fm are thicker and more mobilized than in the Búzios Field In the Tupi Field the pre salt blocks are more rotated and the internal reflectors have a higher inclination than in the study area The evaporite package seems less mobilized and thinner in the Búzios Field area than in Sapinhoa Lapa and Tupi fields Four postulates were crucial to understanding the rifting mechanism responsible for the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Brazilian basins 1 the clockwise rotation of South America relative to Africa about a pole located offshore NE Brazil 2 the prop agation of rifting from south to north 3 the rifting process widened and deepened the South Atlantic basin towards the south and 4 salt mobilization maturity increases basinward Based on these premises we concluded that the increased mobilization of salt higher post rift package thickness and increased syn rift block rotation are associated with the relative distance from the continental margin and conse quently with the amount of displacement generated by the South Atlantic Rift Since this work modeled a unit that spatially corresponds to the Barra Velha Formation this opens up opportunities for future studies with greater detail focused on reservoir characterization With a detailed interpretation grid it is possible to model the carbonate mounds located right below the salt layer which are known to be important traps for oil accumulation Also future works can be implemented in investigating the African counterpart of the Santos Basin to search for clues that determine which rifting mechanism was responsible for the opening of the basin 6 Conclusions In this study we have characterized the Búzios Field in three di mensions using 3D seismic data seismic attributes and well log data The combined use of these tools enabled the understanding of important parameters within the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Santos Basin Specifically we examined how the relative position of the study area concerning the continental margin influences the amount of displacement observed in the region and how this positioning affects the mobilization and thickness of the salt package While most recent studies have focused on the reservoir character ization of the Búzios Field our research aimed to understand how this area fits into the broader context of the evolution of the Santos Basin Through the 3D model we connected the observed features with the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Búzios Field area attempting to investigate how the opening of the rift and halokinesis impacted the current geometric and stratigraphic arrangement In an attempt to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the Santos Basin in a regional approach the mapped units were compared to their analogs within other oil fields situated in different positions within the basin Comparing the study area with the Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields three significant features were crucial to comprehend the rifting evolution within the Santos Basin These features consist of thinner PostRift I Barra Velha Fm and Post Rift II Ariri Fm layers and less mobilization in the Búzios Field Additionally the pre salt blocks display minor rotation and the internal reflectors demonstrate a smoother inclination in the study area when contrasted with these other fields Considering the rift mechanisms and the most widely accepted models for the opening of the South Atlantic Rift this research concludes that the reduced salt mobilization post rift package thickness and rotation of the syn rift blocks in the Búzios Field are associated with the relative distance from the continental margin and thus the magnitude of displacement caused by the South Atlantic Rift In this context the Búzios Field is positioned in closer proximity to the continental margin than the Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields suggesting a lower level of displacement Declaration of generative AI in scientific writing During the preparation of this work the authors used GPT chat in order to improve

STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT The Lagoa Feia Group is stratigraphically above the Cabiúnas Formation and extends to the top of the evaporites of the Retiro Formation embracing both rift and post rift stages Figure 2 It comprises five formations separated by regional and local unconformities thus representing the primary seismic stratigraphic markers Winter et al 2007 Figure 2 The study area is located in the outer distal tectonic sedimentary domains of the rift section of the Lagoa Feia Group where isolated grabens were initially filled with siliciclastics to mixed carbonate deposits that evolved to isolated carbonate platforms built over structural highs continuously in lacustrine conditions Dias et al 1988 Muniz Bosence 2018 The rift stage continued with the deposition of coarse siliciclastics to shales under strong structural control formally described as the Itabapoana and Atafona Formations respectively Towards the end of the rift stage bioclastic rudstones and hybrid laminites represent the Coqueiros Formation Winter et al 2007 Recently its facies associations were reinterpreted in a 3D context and the lower section of the Coqueiros formations was placed in the rift stage while the upper section was classified as a transition rift stage Olivito Souza 2020 During the post rift phase the onset of thermal subsidence led to the environment of deep lakes with internal topographic highs being replaced by an extensive shallow highly alkaline evaporative lacustrine system in which the Macabu Formation was deposited Chang et al 1992 Pietzsch et al 2018 This shallow lake was in turn replaced by a highly evaporative shallow marine setting leading to the deposition of up to 2000 m of evaporites of the Retiro Formation Traditionally the age of evaporites is ca 113 Ma at the top of Aptian Winter et al 2007 Figure 2 From the Albian the deposition of the drift supersequence triggered remarkable thin skinned gravitational gliding of salt and related salt compression in the outer regions of the Campos Basin Davison 2007 Szatmari et al 2021 2 1 Revised age dating of the pre salt sequence The Lagoa Feia Group ranges in age from the Barremian to the Late Aptian Bertani Carozzi 1985a 1985b Thompson et al 2015 Winter et al 2007 Because of the endemic character of its fauna it is challenging to make correlations with basins outside the Central Segment of the South Atlantic Therefore the depositional age of the pre salt sequence had been constrained by radiometric data of underlying basalts of the Cabiúnas Formation Mizusaki et al 1992 and at its top by the age of the EAGE 1659 onset of evaporite deposition of the Retiro Formation ca 115 Ma Szatmari et al 2021 However the assumption of a late Aptian age for the end of deposition of the Macabu Formation and the onset of salt deposition has recently been challenged by several authors Lima et al 2018 Pietzsch et al 2020 Tedeschi et al 2017 2019 Figure 2 New high resolution carbon isotope δ13C profiles from shallow and deepwater drillings in the Eastern Brazilian Margin Sergipe Alagoas Campos and Santos Basins were correlated with well calibrated Tethyan sections These new correlations constrain the end of major evaporite deposition in the South Atlantic to the early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event OAE 1a interval 124 125 Ma thus the age of PRU as being 128 Ma Tedeschi et al 2019 Also an increase in atmospheric CO2 predating the OAE 1a event resulted in a change in the mode of the carbonate factory recorded in the last tens of metres of the Barra Velha Formation in the Santos Basin equivalent to the Macabu Formation in the Campos Basin Hence it puts further time constraints on the age of deposition of the top of the pre salt sequence as not younger than Barremian Pietzsch et al 2020 Additional evidence came from new biostratigraphic records from wells drilled in the deepwater portion of the Campos Basin where Aptian sections of up to 800 m thick occur above the salt Lima et al 2018 Sanjinés et al 2022 However the new constraints for the age of salt thereof have been challenged by a review paper Szatmari et al 2021 Their results kept the age of salt deposition within the usual time frame i e 116 110 Ma based on 39 Ar 40Ar ages from evaporites in the Sergipe Alagoas basin and a pre salt volcano in the southern Santos Basin The main argument of these authors is that the Tethyan section was located in a different realm than the Brazilian margin during the Early Cretaceous thus making the correlation problematic 3 METHODS This study is based on commercial 2D PSTM and 3D PSDM seismic surveys and well data Eight 2D semi regional dip oriented deep seismic lines recorded from 8 to 12 s TWT provided control of the crustal structure and contextualized the 3D survey This

subdivide the pre salt sequence into six seismic tectono stratigraphic sequences TSSs comprising the syn rift SRI SRII SRIII rift transition RTR and post rift PRI PRII tectonic stages Local surfaces were also mapped between these horizons to identify changes in the seismic architecture Faults fold axes and erosional scarps were also mapped throughout The interpreted 3D framework of horizons and faults was converted to a 3D geological model using the Structural Model workflow in Petrel based on a 50 50 m mesh resolution Depth dip and dip direction attributes were extracted from every fault node to construct cross plots and equal area lower hemisphere stereographic diagrams stereograms True Vertical Thickness TVT isopach maps were generated from the model to evaluate thickness variations and evaluate fault controlled accommodation Edge effects due to lack of correlation at the margins of the 3D survey were considered during interpretation Faults were divided into subpopulations grouped by strike direction and structural domains Fossen Rørnes 1996 Faults were also geographically grouped to represent genetically related structures and hence fault branches high strain and intra fault zone domains low strain The 3D model was used to perform fault length versus displacement L D analyses and automatic extraction of horizontal separation heave for each modelled horizon 3D kinematic analysis of more prominent basement faults in rift settings has generally been applied where hanging wall depocentres are thick typically 2 km and a large number of syn rift reflectors occurs e g Collanega et al 2019 Duffy et al 2015 Lenhart et al 2019 Ideally mapped horizons must not represent erosive or highly condensed non depositional events since comparing depositional thickness across the faults is critical for understanding the evolving fault activity However underfilled half grabens are challenging to assess since they often exhibit erosion of the footwall crest McLeod et al 2000 Also prominent footwall highs local and regional unconformities often merge into a few tuned reflectors making correlation challenging In the study area fault scarps folds syn kinematic and prograding wedges and local structural complexities pose further challenges when using these techniques Taking account of these limitations we opted for a more geometrical approach where the hanging wall and footwall cut offs of each seismic horizon and their respective seismic depositional sequence were displayed in the map view resulting in coloured polygons representing the heave for each stratigraphic unit Figure 3a Therefore the heaves were analysed for either a single or a combination of horizons resulting in tectono stratigraphic maps on which the gross cumulative strain and spatio temporal strain variations can be analysed Figure 3b However this indeed takes no account of the possibility of underfilling in particular intervals despite fault scarps occurring only in a handful of fault segments Hence for complex faults with significant across fault correlation uncertainties the cut off lines were modified by additional seismic observation like stratal terminations onlap erosional truncation and downlap divergent syn kinematic reflector and thickness variations providing better time constraints of the fault activity see faults d and e in Figure 3a 4 4 1 RESULTS Structural framework The integration of 2D and 3D seismic structural interpretations from this study were correlated with existing structural maps of the Central Campos Basin Guardado et al 1989a 1989b to extend the documented structural framework to the northern limit of the basin In the northern Campos Basin normal faults striking crudely NNE SSW dip both east and west and constitute a similar rift related fault framework to that mapped towards the south Therefore major structural features i e the São João da Barra and Corvina Parati Lows and the Badejo high extend northwards into the study area Figure 4a From a cross section perspective the pre salt depocentres are younger towards the offshore indicating the progressive rejuvenation of the rifting towards the spreading axis Figure 4b Another notable feature is the shallowing of the seismic Moho below the present day shelf break where there are thicker rift deposits This is interpreted as an early stage upper crustal boudin of an originally thicker upper crust c f Clerc et al 2018 Also notable is the inverse correlation between the upper crust and the pre salt sedimentary thicknesses Figure 4b Over 170 normal faults were mapped within the 3D survey The strike of faults has an average value of N40 with a significant population at N S Figure 5a Dip directions are evenly distributed to E and W although the

STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT the regional basin dip The dip angle tends to increase towards the top of the pre salt sequence Figure A2b Fault distribution and patterns in map view were used to subdivide the area into three major structural domains These correspond to a central roughly NE SW oriented horst flanked by two domains that are structurally lower at the basement level Figure 5a This horst is 10 km wide and is delimited by the major faults that are the strain loci of the area Figure 4a The central horst is here named Guriri Fault System GFS To the west of GFS the structural low is denominated the Inner Guriri Low and to the east is the Outer Guriri Low These three main structural domains exhibit internal deformation by subsidiary faulting denoting internal structural highs and lows Figure 5b The fault networks that focused the strain thus acting to delimit the margins of the GFS are subdivided into three fault branches GFSN GFSE and GFSS Figure 5a The GFSN and GFSE have fault segments dipping in a single direction west and east respectively while the GFSS exhibits structures dipping in both directions Elsewhere a footwall complex FWC represents the major positive structural element flanked to the SSW by a depocentre Low C Within the Inner Guriri Low two internal depocentres are observed A and B and the Outer Guriri Low has two internal lows Low D and Low E and one internal high Well 33 High W33H L Dmax analysis demonstrates that GFS branches focused the strain Figure A3 and stereographic diagrams show that faults within the GFS branches have the main strike direction NE SW that differs from the average direction of the faults elsewhere NNE SSW Figure A4 The structural contours of BSU base salt and the isopach map for the pre salt sequence are shown in Figure 5c d respectively Interestingly the latter barely records the rift related structural framework of Figure 5a attesting to the deposition of a significant succession i e the post rift units in a different tectonic setting The GFSN hosts the major faults in the 3D survey area with 1000 m maximum displacements The fault pattern in the map view is highly segmented with curvilinear fault traces whose strikes range between N S and NE SW and dip systematically to NW Also dip angles decrease northwards along the strike from 45 up to 25 and splay into two segments towards the north Figure 5a b The GFSN has the Low A as the hanging wall block hosting the thickest depocentre in the area with up to 2 6 km of pre salt sediments Low A consists of three subsidiary hanging wall depocentres that are adjacent to zones of maximum displacement of the main segments of the fault zone c f McLeod et al 2000 The footwall of the GFSN i e FWC is internally faulted by NNE SSW striking oblique to GFSN and GFSE mostly E dipping faults with displacements 250 m Figure 5b EAGE 1663 The GFSE is the eastward limit of the GFS and constitutes an array of quasi parallel fault segments that are either hard breached relays or soft linked Figure 5b Segments dip systematically to the E with angles ranging from 45 to 70 and maximum displacements of up to 600 m To the east the Outer GFS Low has subsidiary depocentres in the hanging wall of the major segments of GFSE Lows D and E and an internal high W33H which has the thinnest pre salt of the 3D survey Figure 5d Faults within Outer GFS Low have maximum displacements ranging from 200 to 400 m and are organized as a conjugate set whose intersection branch line is N25 oriented The GFSS is an apparent direct south westward continuation of the GFSN branch but has a contrasting polarity of its main constituent faults dipping predominantly SE The east dipping faults strike N S to NNE and represent the structures with the largest maximum displacement values of up to 500 m that in turn delimit the half graben of Low C Figure 5a b During the course of the rifting new west dipping NE SW striking faults nucleated westwards in an apparent southern extension of the GFSN branch We interpret a roughly NW SE striking transverse structure to the GFS as an accommodation zone c f Morley et al 1990 Figure 5a This interpretation is based on two main lines of evidence Firstly an alignment of a number of breached relays and fault tips Figure 5a b and secondly a demarcation in changes in thickness distribution of the pre salt tectono stratigraphic units 4 2 Seismic stratigraphic framework The primary hierarchy of the subdivision of the pre salt sequence in the study area is two tectono stratigraphic supersequences syn rift SR and post rift PR separated by a rift transition RTR sequence The terminology and interpretational diagnostics leading to this subdivision into supersequences were adapted from previous regional and local scales works Cainelli Mohriak 1999 Olivito Souza 2020 respectively In addition internal unconformities and their correlative conformities allowed the subdivision of the supersequences into units with their own internal organization and termination patterns of seismic reflectors lithological content and thickness distribution They represent units that are lower in the stratigraphic hierarchy and therefore denominated as seismic tectono stratigraphic sequences TSS Figure 6 Six TSSs were recognized three representing the syn rift supersequence syn rift I II and III SRI SRII and SRIII one is

following interpretations are based on geological cross sections and thickness maps Figures 6 and 7 respectively that evidence the spatio temporal changes in the distribution and internal organization of each of the TSSs To illustrate the main lithotypes sidewall cores from selected wells are displayed in Figure A5 4 2 1 The syn rift supersequence Syn rift I TSS SRI This unit is delimited at its base by a major unconformity tBas that separates the Precambrian basement from the sedimentary section The top surface is also unconformable tI A occurring as an erosive truncation in the structural highs and either as correlative conformity or onlapped surface in the depocentres Figure 6a c In Low C this unit defines classical divergent wedge geometry that is diagnostic of syn depositional faulting Figure 6c Elsewhere SRI commonly occurs as parallel layered internal reflectors including in the hanging wall of some major GFSN faults Figure 6a Parallel configurations are commonly inferred as being pre rift in a rift context but this is not considered likely here Instead the parallelism is interpreted as low strain syn rift where distributed faulting provides the accommodation space rather than a single major fault leading to pronounced fault block rotation and divergent geometry The SRI isopach map shows three NNE SSE trending depocentres in the centre of the 3D survey of which Low C is the westernmost and thickest with 900 m of sediments Figures 6c and 7a Interestingly the map distribution of the SRI thickness shows little correlation with the GFS branches compare with Figure 5a Five wells penetrated to the tBas horizon W01 2 4 5 34 The recognition and seismic interpretation of the tBas horizon in the study area is not straightforward and was investigated in detail by Strugale et al 2021 Three wells found SRI basalts that sit on top of the basement when it is present W04 33 34 Wells 33 and 34 drilled EAGE 1665 coarse siliciclastics over basalts while in W04 bioclastic rudstones of the syn rift III SRIII sequence overly SRI basalts Wells W12 14 and 25 only reached the top of the SRI and drilled medium to coarse siliciclastics with high feldspar content SRI is equivalent to three lithostratigraphic units the Cabiúnas Itabapoana and Atafona Formations Figure 2 The basalt thicknesses in the wells are below the vertical seismic resolution 90 m and therefore the top of the Cabiúnas Formation was not mapped Also the seismic signal of SRI and available well data made any differentiation between the Itabapoana and Atafona Formations impossible Syn rift II TSS SRII The syn rift II SRII sequence is delimitated at its base by the tI A unconformity and at its top by the tSRII horizon SRII internal reflectors are parallel or onlap onto the tI A near the active divergent wedges Figure 6a b except for a localized truncation over the Low A1 Figure 6d The upper section of SRII is often conformable to tSRII in dip sections Figure 6b However the strike cross section shows that tSRII pinches out and is truncated towards the south Figure 6d and against the inverted Low C Figure 6f Deposition of SRII was coeval with substantial footwall erosion in the GFSN thus constituting a fault scarp that was onlapped during SRIII Figure 6a The main characteristic of the thickness distribution of SRII is its occurrence as a sub basin Low A within the Inner GFS Low in the hanging wall of the GFSN Figure 7b SRII is absent by non deposition or erosion elsewhere Up to 1 km of sediments accumulate in this sub basin and they show remarkable divergent wedges within Low A2 Figure 6a where the GFSN has its maximum displacement Within Low 2 a strike cross section shows that the upper SRII thickens then onlaps onto the tI A horizon towards Low A1 Figure 6d Elsewhere parallel to tSRII internal seismic reflectors are predominant Figure 6a b d There is no well calibration for the SRII therefore its lithology will be interpreted in the context of the following SRIII TSS The limited areal occurrence of SRII implies that the tI A and tSRII horizons merge elsewhere as tSRII consequently representing a significant gap in the sedimentary record Figure 6c e f However it is not clear if the absence of SRII is the consequence of non deposition pre SRIII erosion or both Syn rift III TSS SRIII The syn rift III SRIII sequence is bounded at its base by both tI A and tSRII surfaces and at its top by the tRift horizon The tRift is widely distributed in the 3D survey as a mostly conformable surface and rarely shows evidence of erosion e g Figure 6d The

1668 STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT EAGE isopach map shows the configuration of thicker depocentres on both sides of the GFS horst ranging from 400 m thick in the outer and up to 800 m thick in the Inner GFS Low Interestingly thicker deposits of SRIII in the Outer GFS Low occur near the GFS East GFSE branch while it thins considerably elsewhere Figure 7c Along the strike of the GFS North GFSN thicker depocentres of SRI and SRII are located in the northern and central sectors of the GFSN branch respectively while SRIII thickens southwards following newly nucleated NE SW striking faults west of GFS South GFSS branch Figures 6d and 7c It demonstrates the overall southward strain migration along the strike of the GFSN and subsequently GFSS thus the overprinting of NE SW segments over SRI N S faults that bounds Low C Consequently Low B was established and therefore configuring the horst geometry of the GFS Figures 6c f and 7c Another notable feature is the post SRII erosion nucleation of subsidiary faults towards the footwall of the GFSN which are parallel in the strike but steeper compared to the earlier segments of the GFSN The timing of formation is endorsed by the thickening of SRIII and rift transition RTR in the hanging wall block Figure 6a b Major rift faults often exhibit erosion in the footwall that Is usually related to footwall uplift and the formation of new faults as the consequence of the rotation of the faulted block in a process known as footwall degradation where faulting occurs either towards the hanging or the footwall blocks Hesthammer Fossen 1999 Morley et al 2007 Wellbore calibration of SRIII is given by the nine penetrations see Section 4 2 1 1 and W17 Figure 7c Bioclastic rudstone coquinas is the most common lithotype in the structural highs while low energy hybrid siltstones occur in depocentres Olivito Souza 2020 The SRIII sequence is therefore correlated to the Coq A unit the basal unit of the Coqueiros Formation according to those authors From the amplitude of the constituent reflectors and similar isopach distribution of SRII seismic tectono sedimentary sequence TSS in the Inner GFS Low compared to the SRIII TSS it is interpreted that both sequences are part of a single phase of rifting and probably share the lithological content The GFSN branch exerts a fundamental role in controlling the creation of depositional space for both units Figure 6a The section equivalent to SRII has been included in the combined Itabapoana and Cabiúnas Formations while SRIII represents the base of the Coqueiros Formation Olivito Souza 2020 Because of the similarities thereof SRII plus SRIII are here interpreted as belonging to the basal unit of the Coqueiros Formation and record syn rift deposits Figure 6b GFSN activity prevails during the SRII and SRIII deposition and contrasts significantly with the SRI structure Figure 7a c In addition fault scarp formation during SRII denotes an active sediment starved graben which is typical in the early stages of rift filling followed by generalized fill of the structural relief during SRIII e g Prosser 1993 Figure 6a 4 2 2 The rift transition sequence The rift transition RTR TSS is delimited by tRift at the base and PRU post rift unconformity at the top The tRift is widely recognized as a conformable surface that is only occasionally onlapped by internal reflectors of RTR The PRU has an erosive character towards the NE region of the survey that leads to top truncation and eventually the complete absence of the RTR in the easternmost portions of the study area Figure 7d Otherwise PRU is also a conformable surface e g Figure 6d Internally the organization of the seismic reflectors are predominantly parallel except when submitted to erosion related to PRU where the modest thickness compromised the resolution of the seismic signal However the proximal hanging wall block of the southern sector of GFSN shows a quite distinct pair of mound shaped reflectors Figure 7d They have a circular to NE trending ellipsoidal planform with 3 5 km average length and exhibit downlapping terminations in the base and are onlapped by the post rift units Figure 6e The mounds are not contemporaneous because the southern mound downlaps in the internal seismic reflector equivalent to the top of the northern mound internal surface IRTR1 Figure 6e However a dip section shows that the mounds are comprised of wedges that prograde from the footwall complex onto the hanging wall of the GFSN Figure 6b This figure also shows that the depositional space occupied by the prograding wedge was created by newly formed NNE SSW to NE SW striking faults towards the footwall of the fault zone These structures are amongst the few that were active during the RTR and are probably related to the ongoing footwall degradation observed during the SRIII Finally the geometry of RTR mounds is similar to the clinoforms observed in deposits in Santos Basin of similar age except for the absence of syn depositional tectonics Barnett et al 2021 The isopach map of the RTR shows an overall thickening to the SW and absence of erosion in the eastern region as major features Figure 7d It also shows the imprint of the main structural compartments of Figure 5a although the W33H internal high has a thinner RTR than the GFS horst The two mounds are quite distinctive hosting the thicker RTR with over 700 m Tilting to the SW along the GFS exerts the primary control on the first order thickness variations so the RTR thickens towards the SW despite the GFS and their counterpart structural lows The southward stepping of the mounds

STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT and erosion towards the NE supports the interpretation of such widespread atilting Several wells 34 reached or drilled through the RTR sequence mainly in the footwall complex The RTR is interpreted as equivalent to the upper section of the Coqueiros Formation described by Olivito and Souza 2020 as a ramp margin shallowing up sequence in modest water depths These authors subdivided the upper section of the Coqueiros Formation into four sub units Coq B E and proposed their inclusion as a transition rift stage The mounds are interpreted as berm and shoreface facies associations The relatively homogeneous isopach distribution and depositional style could be interpreted as resembling a post rift architecture However the role of syn depositional faulting remains significant on both sides of the GFS horst Figures 6b and 7d Therefore the RTR is better explained as a transition sequence between clear syn rift sequences SRII and SRIII and clear post rift sequences PRI and PRII 4 2 3 The post rift supersequence The post rift tectono stratigraphic sequence has aggradational parallel to mound shaped seismic facies and is characterized by a lack of any significant syn depositional fault activity It corresponds to the Macabu Formation that extends throughout the Campos and Santos basin where it is named Barra Velha Formation both deposited in an extensive sag like basin geometry Pietzsch et al 2018 The Macabu Formation comprises shallowing up cyclothems of mud grade laminated carbonates mm diameter spherulitic carbonates and calcite shrub like crusts all deposited in a highly alkaline evaporative lake Lima De Ros 2019 Wright Barnett 2015 Using well data logs and cores as a proxy for depositional facies clay content and therefore water depth the overall stacking pattern is a deepening post rift I PRI tectono stratigraphic sequence TSS followed by a shallowing up post rift II PRII TSS sequence Herlinger Jr et al 2017 Muniz Bosence 2015 the IPRU Internal Post Rift unconformity separates the two TSSs and according to Herlinger Jr et al 2017 is equivalent to a third order sequence boundary Post rift I PRI TSS The PRI TSS is delimited at the base by the PRU unconformity and the top by the IPRU internal post rift unconformity The PRU is related to extensive pre PRI erosion in the NE region of the study area and similar to in the rift transition RTR the erosive nature of the PRU and IPRU increase towards the NE Consequently EAGE 1669 PRI discretely onlaps onto the PRU and is truncated by IPRU erosion towards the east Figure 6c e Otherwise these surfaces occur as correlative conformities see the southern sector of Section 6d The PRI filling pattern is dominantly aggradational and therefore shows a parallel internal organization of the seismic reflectors A few isolated build ups occur in the crest of the GFSN Figure 7e with no clear relation with active faulting which differs from RTR mounds Thickness distribution has two major domains separated by transverse NNW SSE trace across the centre of the 3D survey Figure 7e equivalent in position to the accommodation zone shown in Figure 5a To the east the thickness is typically around 100 m and barely reaches 300 m in the hanging walls of the GFS branches To the west the average thickness is around 300 m and reaches up to 650 m in the westernmost region Notice that the main compartments and the sub compartments of the rift stage are barely recognizable in the isopach map When observed thickening in the hanging walls of Guriri Fault System GFS branches is probably related to inherited structural relief from RTR resulting in contrasting accommodation space across the faults Post rift II PRII TSS The uppermost unit of the pre salt sequence is delimited at the base by the IPRU and at the top by the base salt unconformity BSU Figure 6 The PRII internal reflectors are usually parallel to the IPRU except when it is downlaped by mounds Figure 6a The BSU is quite distinctive and reveals significant erosion in the hinge of fault propagation folds and footwall blocks Figure 6b c e and within the Inner GFS Low Figure 6d The internal reflectors of PRII are usually parallel but often onlapping onto the IPRU as tilting to SW remains active just after the PRI and are commonly truncated at the top by the BSU Internal surfaces IPRII1 3 are particularly abundant in the Inner GFS Low and suggest a cut and fill geometry Figure 6d e f Mounded shape packages occur extensively over the upward projection of the GFSN branch and are apical to its faults related to footwall degradation Figures 6a and 7f Therefore these mounds are symmetrical and prograde onto both footwalls and hanging walls of the fault segment that anchors them Apart from differences in terms of average and maximum values the thickness distribution is similar to that of the PRI i e it is divided into two major domains separated by an NNW SSE accommodation zone and does not follow the major structural domains of the rift stage The main difference between PRI and PRII thicknesses is the lack of broad post depositional erosion towards the east in the latter The relatively homogeneous thickness of the PRII shows an increasingly sag depositional geometry in the form of

1670 wider depocentres compared to syn rift and RTR sequences preceding evaporite deposition Figure 4 However the present day configuration of the bSalt far from being horizontal and undisturbed Figure 5c points towards significant post salt tectonism affecting the pre salt sequence 4 3 STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT EAGE Tectono stratigraphic evolution Having the gross structural and stratigraphic framework established it is integrated into the tectono stratigraphic maps Figure 3 for each of the seismic tectono stratigraphic sequences TSSs Figure 8 These maps focused on an area that includes the Guriri Fault System GFS and the near adjacent Inner and Outer GFS Lows Fault displacement analysis and fold descriptions provided further input for the kinematic analysis that underpins this summary of the tectono stratigraphic evolution The tectono stratigraphic maps show that the rift related subsidence was highly diachronous along the NE SW striking GFS Figure 8 They also show that the final horst geometry of the GFS had only developed towards the end of rifting Thickness maps and the alignment of fault tips and changes in the strike of rift faults suggest the underlying and sometimes cryptic influence of NW SE transverse structures Figures 3b and 5b d A comparison of the three TSSs of the syn rift stage reveals similarities between the maps of SRII and SRIII that make them distinct from SRI Amongst the differences we note the lithological contrast volcanics plus coarse siliciclastics of SRI to carbonates of SRII plus SRIII TSSs Figure 2 and mostly the contrasting structural pattern and therefore depocentre distribution Figure 7a c Also the significant time gap related to the tSRII unconformity since it represents the merge of two unconformable surfaces tI A and tSRII in most areas should be considered Finally the inversion of the most significant depocentre of SRI i e Low C clear predates the SRII plus SRIII deposition Figure 6c f It is important here to distinguish between the inversion that predates the SRII plus SRIII related to stress redistribution during the rift related extension and best exemplified in the Low C and the inversion represented by selective reactivation of rift faults during the post rift stage as a result of compressional far field stress Interpretation of inversion was based on the occurrence of depocentres in a higher structural position than the neighbour blocks with respect to the newest stratigraphic unit and the observation of displacement variations along a fault on which normal displacement occurs in the deeper segment and reverse displacement occurs in the shallower segment Based on the contrasting strain and depocentre distribution filling patterns and lithologies we interpret the syn rift supersequence as constituted of two distinct rift phases where the rift phase 1 RP1 comprises SRI and rift stage 2 RP2 comprises SRII combined with SRIII Our subdivision of RTR PRI and PRII closely follows the general classifications of rift transition and post rift stages proposed by Olivito and Souza 2020 and Winter et al 2007 respectively compare Figures 2 and 6 One of the main differences between our interpretation of the rift evolution in the study area from the previous study by Olivito and Souza 2020 is that these authors assigned a climax rift stage to the whole interval below the rift transition in agreement with most of the previous publications e g Winter et al 2007 Figure 2 Our interpretation is to replace the climax rift stage of Olivito and Souza 2020 with a syn rift supersequence On the other hand we agreed with the term rift transition proposed by Olivito and Souza 2020 where the RTR mimics characteristics of both syn rift and post rift stages By the way of summary we present our interpretation of the tectono stratigraphic evolution of the pre salt sequence in the North of the Campos Basin as a series of evolutionary schematic sections in Figure 9 It presents two cross sections located north and south of the accommodation zone Figure 5a equivalent in location to the geological cross sections of Figure 6b c respectively Figure 9 emphasizes the general features of the sediment fill geometries and bounding surfaces This figure demonstrates that the subsidence is often diachronous and heterogeneous from SRI to PRI along and across the GFS horst leading to sedimentary thickening contemporaneous to aggradational depositional patterns and sub aerial exposure thus erosion in each of the TSSs Based on the tectono stratigraphic maps Figure 8 and the evolutionary schemes of Figure 9 Figure 10 summarizes in map view the strain distribution and depocentre creation of each of the rift phases RP1 and RP2 during the deposition of the syn rift supersequence The extension directions for each of the rift phases were established as being roughly orthogonal to the major active fault segments thus depocentre distribution Figure 10 also shows the effects of the roughly NW SE structure transverse to the GFS in the structural style and strain evolution during the syn rift stage While acting as a WNW ESE oriented kinematic buffer during RP1 the NW SE structure is interpreted as an accommodation zone during the RP2 with close spatial relation with the Vitória Colatina Lineament Figure 4a 4 3 1 Rift phase 1 RP1 Rift phase 1 RP1 took place over

STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT developed in the GFSN resulting in major overprinting of rift phase 2 RP2 over RP1 structures Figures 8 and 10 The first stage of RP2 deposition occurred during the syn rift II SRII sequence in a mini basin Low A in the hanging wall block of the GFSN branch Fault growth and linkage inherited from the previously E W to NE SW trending RP1 faults resulted in a fault zone whose main segments were sigmoidal Figure 8b Towards the syn rift III SRIII sequence thicker depocentres migrated southwards along the GFSN from Low A2 to Low A3 away from the thicker SRI A1 Low depocentre see Figure 7a c Such southward strain migration kept active during the rift transition sequence RTR This along strike strain migration suggests that the GFSN was part of a longer fault zone that extended northwards out of seismic coverage on which the strain had been propagating southwards until the rift transition phase Figure 10 Also the increasingly lower fault dip angles 30 northwards suggest that rotation of fault planes during extension led to the locking of the fault c f Reston 2020 and therefore strain had to migrate southwards The filling pattern of the early RP2 i e SRII is

Such a pattern is reminiscent of the rift climax or through going faulting stages of respectively Prosser 1993 and Gawthorpe and Leeder 2008 Figure 9 Rift initiation or pre rift layers are represented by RP1 deposits Figure 6a b d Discrete onlap of SRII onto the tI A horizon Figure 6a suggests that fault rotation occurred prior to the onset of deposition consistent with the unconformable character of the tI A plus tSRII unconformity Figure 6c f A period of non deposition within the Inner GFS Low occurred before the onset of SRIII deposition as evidenced by the onlaps of SRIII onto the tSRII surface Figure 6b d Sub aerial exposure and erosion occurred elsewhere tuning the seismic response of the tSRII and tI A surfaces These suggest that another episode of tectonic activity could have rearranged the depositional systems leading to a long enough period of sediment starvation that allowed the deformation of the substrate that was subsequently onlapped by the SRIII Figure 6d The depositional pattern of SRIII completed the tapering of the structural relief of SRII exemplified by the wide occurrence of SRIII Figure 7c and its onlapping onto syn SRII fault scarps and the footwall complex FWC Figure 9 Divergent wedges occurring against segments in the south of GFSN in the GFSE and west of GFSS Figure 6a b c imply that most of the GFS structures were still active in this interval The overall strain distribution during RP2 is relatively homogeneous defining the present day rift related EAGE 1675 structural compartmentalization of the study area Figure 5a The tectono stratigraphic maps shown in Figure 8b c shows that the two major rift faults GFSN and GFSE southern part are collinear but have opposite dip directions This change in polarity occurs across the NW SW accommodation zone Figure 10 The dominant NE SW strike of the normal faults with major displacement and length is argued to be the result of an NW SE to WNW ESE extension during the rift phase 2 RP2 Figure 10 Besides this rotation of the extension direction with respect to rift phase 1 RP1 it was still slightly oblique to the basement structural grain hence some left lateral reactivation could still occur However a few but remarkable N S faults were active during the syn rift III sequence SRIII deposition exemplified in Figure 6b and by an N S graben within the NW SE accommodation zone Figure 8c Therefore we argue for a slight anticlockwise rotation of the extension direction to WNW ESE during SRIII and a secondary right lateral kinematics along the NW SE trend Figure 10 Figure 12 exemplifies the potential effects of such change in the extension direction in an area where two non parallel major segments of the GFSN interact Notice how the post syn rift II sequence SRII deformation by amplification of hanging wall folding as a consequence of localized shortening preceded and therefore is onlapped by SRIII This shortening is also noticeable during the rift transition RTR sequence as evidenced by the onlap onto folded tRift Figure 12a 4 3 3 The rift transition phase The rift transition phase is equivalent to the RTR sequence and marks the onset of thermal subsidence coeval with regional tilting to SW and localized faulting related to the ongoing displacement of rift phase 2 RP2 faults The isopach map demonstrates the interaction of the processes above leading to the accumulation of remarkable carbonate mounds in the hanging wall of the Guriri Fault System North GFSN branch and an overall thickening of the RTR towards the SW see Figure 8 Active deformation during the RTR shown in Figure 8d is restricted to fault segments located within the GFS branches most notably in the southern sector of GFSN Figure 12 Strike and dip attributes resemble the later RP2 structures The onset of SW tilting resulted in localized erosion of later RP2 deposits i e SRIII in structural highs mainly in the Well 33 High W33H within the Outer GFS Low Figure 7d The extensive erosion that predates the post rift deposition suggests increasing tilting during the transition to the post rift and therefore explains the gentle onlap of both RTR and Post Rift I PRI sequences onto the tRift and Post rift Unconformity

STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT is uniform followed by sub aerial exposure and erosion preceding the evaporite deposition Figure 9 There was some minor syn depositional faulting during the PRI but this was restricted to the active segments during the rift transition phase The group of carbonate mounds are also anchored over the upward projection of underlying faults but shows no thickness variations across the structures Figure 13 Towards the top of the PRII sequence and throughout evaporite deposition inversion by selective reactivation of rift related faults resulted in a set of fault propagation folds Figure 14 We interpret most of the fault propagation folds in the study area as related to the inversion of normal faults through compression thought to be orthogonal to the faults The main evidence is the hanging wall of the previously normal faults is higher than the footwalls Figure 13c d Konstantinovskaya et al 2007 Letouzey et al 1990 Withjack et al 2002 There were significant changes in the intensity of reactivation along the strike of GFSN In the south inversion is restricted to the hanging wall Figures 9 and 13c while inversion folds involved both hanging and footwall blocks towards the north leading to widespread uplift of both GFSN and the adjacent footwall FWC Figure 13b SE dipping normal faults were apparently inverted in the FWC which suggests the contribution of reactivation of Precambrian metamorphic fabric that resembles the dip and strikes direction of the rift faults in this location Strugale et al 2021 It also resulted in a monocline structure in the hanging wall block and the formation of up to 500 m of structural relief The presence of a relict pod of salt on the western side suggests that the structural relief was active during salt tectonics Figure 13b Notice that the inversion related folds have no correlation with salt thickness therefore are not the result of errors during the time depth conversion due to velocity variations related to variations in the salt thickness The interpretation of paleostresses related to tectonic inversion is problematic because of the thin sedimentary cover and strong coupling between inversion and the inverted faults Therefore newly formed structures may not directly reflect the new stress field but rather the structure that has been reactivated c f Kelly et al 1999 The orientation of the inversion folds at first suggests a simple NW SE shortening However the framework of fold axes in the thicker southern half of Figure 13a shows two sets of NNE SSW and NW SE hinge lines both deforming the bSalt horizon Figure 13e The erosion in the hinge zones of fault propagation folds FPFs and truncations on the Post rift II PRII sequence by the bSalt horizon is interpreted as the result of significant long term sub aerial exposure of the top of EAGE 1677 PRII thus related to the base salt unconformity BSU Also a folded geometry is observed towards the top of the salt in some localities Figure 13c d implying that folding was active for a significant time after the onset of evaporite deposition and potentially until the onset of the salt tectonics in the Albian Cobbold Szatmari 1991 Fetter 2009 In addition assuming that the inversion leads to localized e g segments of Guriri Fault system East GFSE or generalized GFSN and footwall complex FWC uplift this could have delayed the onset evaporite deposition over these areas Consequently using the basin scale correlations to estimate the age of the onset of evaporite deposition in the context of the study area could be problematic Davison 2007 Kukla et al 2018 Szatmari et al 2021 Meanwhile it is possible that there was significant sub aerial epigenetic karstification related to the BSU resulting in secondary porosity in the upper section of post rift carbonates The occurrence of epigenetic karst on top or within carbonate sequences is well known in this type of context e g Saller et al 1994 5 5 1 DISC USSION Strain migration during rifting The shallowing of the Moho below the present day shelf break of the Campos Basin has been observed in several publications Matos et al 2021 Meisling et al 2001 Mohriak et al 2008 Stanton et al 2019 Matos et al 2021 show that such uplift correlates with a thicker pre salt package referred by Figure 4b The location of Moho uplifts in the SE Brazilian margin is considered to be related to lateral changes in the lithospheric thickness inherited from Brasiliano orogenic assembly that allowed later along rift axis flow of plume material Morgan et al 2020 The presence of an important basement tectonic limit near the study area i e tectonic limit between the Oriental Terrane of Ribeira belt and the Cabo Frio Tectonic Domain Figure 1 Stanton et al 2019 Strugale et al 2021 could have worked as such a lithospheric limit Hence a longer residence of plume material could result in lithospheric thinning and extension thus strain localization evidenced by the development of major rift faults and thicker depocentres such as the Corvina Parati and São João da Barra Lows in the shallow waters of the Central and North Campos Basin Figure 4 Rift basins that evolve to oceanic crust are characterized by strain diachroneity along dip and strike meaning that the strain locus migrates towards the propagation centre Lavier Manatschal 2006 Consequently rift units in a distal position will correlate to post rift units towards the

1680 EAGE Detailed 3D seismic interpretation identified an active NW SE accommodation zone during the RP2 near the position of this regional lineament Figures 8 10 and 14 Similarly a WNW ESE trend worked as a kinematic buffer during RP1 which can be correlated with the Castelo Lineament c f Almeida et al 2021 Figure 10 Detailed 3D seismic mapping of the pre salt sequence this work and of the basement Strugale et al 2021 did not recognize any discrete NW SE structure Therefore assuming the NW SE and WNW ESE lineaments here identified as being correlative to either Vitória Colatina or Castelo lineaments onshore is still speculative especially the second The inversion structures resulting from selective reactivation of NE SW rift faults due to orthogonal compression observed towards the end of post rift supersequence and onwards are best explained by intraplate stress propagation from oceanic mid ridge spreading c f Artyushkov 1973 Such a mechanism had been correlated with Late Cretaceous and Tertiary inversions in the Campos Basin competing with far field compression from the Andean Orogen Fetter 2009 Considering the estimated onset of oceanic crust generation in the Campos Basin as ca 117 Ma Heine et al 2013 the observed inversion in Figures 13 and 14 could be correlated with the onset of oceanic spreading thus ridge pushing 5 2 Rift and post rift tectono stratigraphic evolution The filling architecture of rift basins in both natural and experimental physical and numerical is the subject of numerous publications Amongst them 2D and 3D models for tectono sedimentary evolution of rift basins in general Gawthorpe Leeder 2008 Prosser 1993 for continental lacustrine environments Lambiase 1990 Morley 2002 and the model for rift sequence stratigraphy of Martins Neto and Catuneanu 2010 will be compared with our interpretations In common these publications point to the difficult task to understand the feedback between tectonic related and purely eustatic driven sea lake level changes This is especially problematic in rift basins where the fault controlled depocentres form diachronously and the accommodation space in lacustrine settings is subject to local climate constraints thus disregarding global eustatic curves Catuneanu 2006 Although the references thereof are relevant contributions to understanding the evolution of rift basins they also proposed denominations for the stages and patterns of rift filling that are far to be homogenous The main point is that they mostly rely on the interpretation of regional 2D seismic lines to set up the models However our interpretation is founded on a 3D seismic survey at the STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT oilfield scale which differs from the models mentioned Hence each geological cross section here presented would fit or not in each of the models used as references Gawthorpe Leeder 2008 Lambiase 1990 Morley 2002 Prosser 1993 For example in the context of the RP2 the syn rift II sequence SRII could represent either the rift climax system Prosser 1993 interaction and linkage stage during highstand in a lacustrine or shallow water context Gawthorpe Leeder 2008 and early half graben stage Morley 2002 Our interpretations clearly show that there is no silver bullet in the literature and therefore is pointless to put effort into trying to fit our results to any individual or a combination of these classifications We tentatively compared our findings with the few publications focused on the petrological sedimentological content and the 2D seismic stratigraphic architecture of a single half graben in the shallow water domain of the Central Campos Basin Alvarenga et al 2021 Goldberg et al 2017 Three syn rift system tracts represent the rift tectono sedimentary record as interpreted by Alvarenga et al 2021 Their basal unit Rift Initiation could potentially be correlated with RP1 and the upper High and uppermost Low Tectonic Activity Systems Tracts could be correlated with respectively SRII and syn rift III SRIII i e the RP2 Alternatively the Low Tectonic Activity System Tract LTAST could be correlated with the Rift Transition sequence However this latter correlation is problematic because 1 LTAST is wedge shaped and is similar to either SRII or SRIII 2 the authors interpret significant LTAST syn tectonic gravitational deposits Goldberg et al 2017 and 3 the lack of data and interpretation in the footwall block does not allow correlations with the graben fill and a clear understanding of how fault activity evolves towards the end of rifting From that our choice is to use the strain distribution and evolution tied with a well constrained seismic stratigraphic framework which is only possible if preceded by high density 3D seismic mapping e g Figure 5 A dense mapping of seismic horizons faults and stratal terminations against them followed by integration with isopach contours to build tectono stratigraphic maps Figures 3 8 and 14 was the main criteria to distinguish two phases of rifting RP1 and RP2 Figures 9 and 10 The superposing of snapshots of the strain distribution along time was the best strategy to unveil the complex strain evolution Such an approach could fill the gap originated in the biased sampling by wellbore data i e wells were drilled only in the structural highs especially regarding the lack of rock data of gravitational and reworked deposits in the regions where syn sedimentary tectonism is expected to be high Our interpretations reveal that the changes in strain distribution during the rifting are the product of two

STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT directions of extension E W during RP1 and roughly NW SE during RP2 Figure 10 PR1 is characterized by small and isolated grabens with preserved thickness up to 900 m while RP2 evolves to longer grabens that host up to 1800 m that often did not take advantage of RP1 faults Figure 8a c In addition RP1 depocenters were inverted while new faults nucleated or linked from initially isolated RP1 faults e g GFSN resulting in the final horst geometry of the GFS Such an overall pattern resembles the models of rift basins where they are initially characterized by isolated grabens with small displacements followed by fault interaction and linkage leading to the formation of larger grabens Gawthorpe Leeder 2008 Gupta et al 1998 These models however do not necessarily mean a change in extension directions and do not mention different rift phases An additional argument for two phases of rifting is the contrasting lithologies from volcaniclastics plus coarse siliciclastics RP1 to carbonates and hybrid siltstones RP2 Figure 9 Also the merge of two unconformities tI A and tSRII into a single surface in most of the area is meaningful for a significative gap in the sedimentary record between RP1 and RP2 which is not observed for any other mapped horizon Figure 6 Superimposed rift phases have been observed in rifts and are related to changes in the stress field during their evolution Bosworth 1994 Lambiase 1990 Morley 2017 In examples from the North Sea and Sudan rift phases are directly superimposed or have a sag phase in between McHargue et al 1992 Phillips et al 2019 Multiple rift phases are recognized in the NE Brazilian margin and within aulacogens in the counterpart Borborema province Matos et al 2021 However the stratigraphic charts of the Campos Basin and the adjacent Santos and Espírito Santo basins França et al 2007 Moreira et al 2007 Winter et al 2007 only recognize a single rift phase Therefore our proposal for two rift phases for the Campos Basin is a significant turning point for the knowledge of the basin We must recognize that such an interpretation is not novel see Mohriak et al 2008 but had been neglected in most publications afterwards 5 3 Implications for the age of the pre salt sequence The interpretation of two phases of rifting in the northern Campos Basin here presented shall be confronted with the new age constraints for the end of the pre salt deposition the onset of evaporite deposition and the post salt sedimentary column Lima et al 2018 Pietzsch et al 2020 Sanjinés et al 2022 Tedeschi et al 2017 2019 Traditionally the pre salt sequence EAGE 1681 in the East Brazilian margin is interpreted as a single rift phase plus post rift succession spanning 19 Myr in total from Hauterivian 134 Ma to Late Aptian ca 115 Ma e g Mohriak et al 1990 Winter et al 2007 Recently the age of the end of pre salt deposition was interpreted as not younger than Barremian 125 Ma Pietzsch et al 2020 and the age of evaporite deposition as being Early Aptian ca 124 Ma Tedeschi et al 2017 2019 Although the age of evaporites is still under debate see Discussion in review paper of Szatmari et al 2021 the problem remains how to accommodate two phases of rifting instead of one a rift transition and a post rift stages in a time interval ca 10 Myr shorter than previously assumed The first option is to challenge the age of the onset of volcanism assuming it as a proxy for rift related mechanical subsidence In the onshore basement counterpart to the northern Campos Basin tholeiitic dykes emplaced along NW SE lineaments are dated as being as old as 142 Ma Berriasian Santiago et al 2020 and 136 Ma Valanginian Pessano et al 2021 in close geochemical and temporal relationship with the Paraná Etendeka LIP and to early manifestations of the break up of the South Atlantic Ocean e g Matos 2021 Also several publications show evidence of Late Jurassic to Valanginian rift related deposition along the proto Central Segment of the South Atlantic Ocean For example the Afro Brazilian depression in Northeast Brazil Kuchle et al 2011 Matos et al 2021 and Kimmeridgian L Jurassic rift units at the base of the Camboriú Formation in the Santos Basin equivalent to the Cabiúnas Formation Alves et al 2020 A simple though not definitive solution would be considering the life span of the pre salt envelope as being the previously assumed 19 Myr Winter et al 2007 and therefore the age of the onset of rifting would be at ca 144 Ma In this assumption we are contesting the oldest ages of the volcanic of the Cabiúnas Formation i e 134 Ma This assumption is partially supported by the mean age of emplacement of onshore dykes ca 142 Ma in the Castelo swarm according to Santiago et al 2020 which is here considered as a proxy for the onset of mechanical subsidence The tholeiitic composition of these onshore dykes is the same as the Cabiúnas volcaniclastics Mizusaki et al 1992 However although this interpretation kept the pre salt rift plus post rift within the global dataset of the life span of rift basins ca 20 Myr Woodcock 2004 the assumption of dyke emplacement and volcanism as a proxy to the onset of rifting is problematic especially in the context of a magma poor margin Morgan et al 2020 Therefore an investigation focused on obtaining further radiometric ages in the pre salt basalts especially in the northern Campos Basin should be considered in future works

alkalinity Pietzsch et al 2018 Conceptual models and analogue studies from marine systems indicate that different carbonate factory types are associated not only with different porosities and permeability distributions but also with different largescale stratigraphic architectures Pomar 2001 Schlager 2005 Della Porta et al 2013 Minzoni et al 2013 The same concept and relationships are likely to be applicable to lacustrine systems where variations in water chemistry are more extreme and should result in even larger variations in carbonate factory types and stratigraphic architectures Data and methods Seismic stratigraphy and seismic facies were interpreted and mapped on both regional 2D lines over the Campos and Santos basins and on a large CGG PSDM 3D volume covering the entire Cluster Area Sugar Loaf High Tupi Lula High Iara and Jupiter High along with the addition of smaller volumes over the Libra Peroba and Buzios Gato de Mato Epitonium areas Figs 1 2 Mapping over the larger cluster area was aided by the analyses of amplitude semblance and isochore maps extracted from key seismic stratigraphic surfaces Mapping over Libra also included observations on root mean square amplitude maps and application of a Van Gogh ﬁlter to minimize directional noise Observations on seismic facies and seismic unconformities were calibrated with 100 wells regionally distributed over the Campos and Santos basins and containing standard petrophysical data core and rotary sidewall core samples as well as borehole images This study focuses on the Santos Basin and builds on the analysis and integration of 2D and 3D seismic data with 79 wells including 19 with BHI logs and 14 cores with a cumulative core thickness of approximately 1000 m A total of 16 wells were tied to the seismic trace and used for detailed calibration of the seismic facies Figs 1 2 Table 1 All of the seismic facies types Table 1 described in this study were tied to wells using both BHI and core material from at least one location commonly more At this time the BHI logs cannot be reproduced owing to conﬁdentiality limitations The major unconformities were identiﬁed in seismic volumes calibrated with well data and correlated regionally The base salt is a high amplitude peak reﬂector that can be correlated across basins The Intra Alagoas Unconformity IAU or base sag Fig 3 is prominent on palaeohighs but can appear conformable in palaeodepressions The Pre Alagoas Unconformity PAU Fig 3 is interpreted as the switch from rifting to a transitional phase It is a seismic angular unconformity only locally where significant tilting of underlying strata occurred The calibration of seismic facies consisted of an initial analysis and identiﬁcation of reﬂector packages near the wellbores for each tied well Each individual seismic facies zone in the well was identiﬁed by a top and a bottom based on the geometric attributes of the reﬂection packages see Table 1 and conﬁrmed with BHI data where available These intervals were then compared with both well and core based facies associations to help calibrate the lower resolution seismic interpretations with the higher resolution well based observations Comparisons between these two different methods generally showed good agreement validating the seismic facies as good proxies for depositional facies and thus environment of deposition For example SF3 facies identiﬁed in seismic images and consisting of inclined reﬂectors were conﬁrmed by inclined stratal packages observed in BHI Where discrepancy occurred further iterations of near wellbore seismic facies identiﬁcation were performed with corrections made where interpretational ambiguity existed Owing to major differences between the carbonate factories characterizing the Itapema and Barra Velha depositional systems dominated by coquina and microbial abiotic carbonate rocks respectively and the sparse calibration data for the rift system only a basic workﬂow was applied to the Itapema Formation This workﬂow relied primarily upon well data and seismic derived maps rather than detailed line by line gridded seismic facies interpretation as was done for the Barra Velha interval Detailed mapping of seismic facies was performed on the sag interval Upper Barra Velha only Seismic reﬂection packages are classiﬁed into four main seismic facies according to their external geometric attributes and are interpreted based on the attributes of the internal reﬂectors and their position within the depositional proﬁle Table 1 Scrupulous

which have been widely documented in marine systems are also observed in cores that penetrated the lacustrine presalt section although the detailed interpretation of depositional settings is complicated by the unusual nature of the speciﬁc facies In general platform or shelf margin facies are dominantly grain supported or are composed of autochthonous precipitates whereas slope facies and protected slightly deeper shelf areas away from the margin contain a markedly higher abundance of mud and Mg clay dominated textures Table 1 Fig 4c see also Figs 1 2 4a for location of wells that penetrated SF3 facies interpreted as slope The position of the shelf margin whether truly marking base level or not can therefore also be used as a proxy for base level ﬂuctuation with the advantage of being easier to identify than coastal onlaps in seismic images Platform and shelf margins in the presalt Santos are geometrically identiﬁed in seismic images by the slope break that separates originally subhorizontal and parallel reﬂectors SF2 facies from inclined or wedged reﬂectors SF3 and SF4 facies Table 1 and can be classiﬁed as retrogradational backstepping aggradational progradational and downstepping Fig 3 Despite the complexity of the stratigraphic architecture of the presalt section in the Santos Basin a few general sequence stratigraphic observations can be extracted for the relatively better studied and more widely distributed upper synrift and sag Itapema and Barra Velha intervals Itapema The Itapema interval is here deﬁned tectono stratigraphically as the lower part of the synrift interval bounded at the base by a reginal transgression that marks the inception of carbonate deposition and at the top by the PAU Fig 3 Moreira et al 2007 Winter et al 2007 Buckley et al 2015 Pietzsch et al 2018 The Itapema Formation is informally known as the coquina and has equivalences in the Campos Basin to the north Fig 3 Across the study area the stratigraphy of the Itapema interval is based primarily on interpretation of seismic reﬂection data well and core calibration was mainly limited to the Libra structure Figs 1 2 With the exception of Libra carbonate systems are largely untested in this interval but seismic data indicate general progradation of inclined reﬂectors SF3 Table 1 during this time for the greater Santos area Fig 3 Although poorly constrained details of the stratigraphy of the Itapema are important to understanding carbonate reservoir distribution in Libra and other prospects in the northern part of the Santos Basin as

Carminatti et al 2008 Saller et al 2016 Barnett et al 2020 The Itapema in the North Santos occurs over relatively small but high relief basement blocks a few kilometres across and up to 800 metres high and consists of a thick interval of inclined facies SF3 Table 1 connecting very thin or null platform tabular parallel facies SF2 Table 1 at the top of the basement blocks to off platform tabular parallel facies SF2 Table 1 with variable thickness Fig 4 This package records strong progradation with toplap and downlap geometries which are indicative of minimal to negative accommodation at the platform top Fig 4 Local downstepping Figs 3 4 indicates forced regression and progressive base level fall during later depositional stages of the interval Detailed mapping reveals that the bulk of the deposition over the NW sector of Libra occurred as a relatively localized series of leeward progradational fan and lobe shaped geobodies possibly reworked by longshore currents during lowstands Barnett et al 2020 or by deeper water currents during highstands Fig 4 Mounded facies SF1 Table 1 within the upper rift interval are relatively extensive up to 3 km long and several hundred metres wide and up to several tens of metres thick Fig 4a The upwardconvex reﬂector packages are commonly internally chaotic or transparent and rooted onto the underlying topographic highs usually lining rift shoulders and windward margins Less common SF1 facies occurring atop progradational facies are generally characterized by internal shingled reﬂections Volumetrically the Itapema at Libra is almost exclusively composed of inclined facies SF3 Table 1 with limited mounded facies SF1 Table 1 and very limited tabular parallel facies SF2 Table 1 Fig 4a Inclined reﬂector packages are progradational internally chaotic and steep up to 18 Fig 4c suggesting that the clinoforms are composed of coarse shell fragments coquina but with local sedimentation breaks represented by hardgrounds or clay rich intervals as highlighted by high internal reﬂectivity and conﬁrmed by lithological observations from core samples Barnett et al 2020 The stratigraphic top of the Itapema is characterized by large arcuate scar features that extend up to 4 km along the shelf break and 1 km shelfward Fig 4 and by linear channel shape structures about 2 km long at the base of slope that run perpendicular to the shelf margin Fig 5 These features are interpreted respectively as margin collapse and weak channelization at the base of slope a feature commonly observed in grain dominated carbonate slopes e

abundant precipitation of Mg rich clays such as stevensite and the occurrence of deep water The local occurrence of clinoforms within the upper rift section supports a similar depositional model for the coquina Itapema Formation Mounded facies SF1 Table 1 within the Itapema interval are relatively extensive and rooted onto the underlying topographic highs They are interpreted as the production loci of the shell material that was either locally reworked into shoals or transported downslope to form prograding clinoform packages Despite the apparent lack of boundstone in the Itapema these clinoforms are comparable in size and dip angle with those observed in the Barra Velha Fig 4 Barnett et al 2020 Steep slopes may have resulted from deposition of the coarse shell material at angle of repose early cementation and stabilization of slope sediment or both The occurrence of large collapse and healed scars along the margins of Libra Fig 4 suggests that early cementation may have played a role at least locally It is also important to note that progradation of the Itapema did not ﬁll the basin and that the youngest clinoforms attained at least 350 m in height Fig 4 recording a very steep and rugged palaeotopography at time of initial deposition of the Barra Velha A switch to shallow lakes across the PAU would not only imply a lake level drop of 350 m but also a very prolonged exposure of the top and slope of the Itapema interval Controls on sequence stratigraphic architecture In marine settings the large scale architecture of carbonate systems is controlled in ﬁrst principle by the antecedent topography the available accommodation and its lateral and vertical variation through time tectonic setting and the carbonate factory type e g Pomar 2001 Bosence 2005 Schlager 2005 Dorobek 2008 Minzoni et al 2013 The same ﬁrst order controls must operate in any type of sedimentary basin including lacustrine systems as long as there is sufﬁcient supersaturation and precipitation of calcium carbonate either biotically or abiotically The main difference between lacustrine and marine systems of comparable size is the water chemistry and therefore the carbonate factory type Minzoni et al 2017 Eberli et al 2019 Large lacustrine systems characterized by tapering saturation with water depth would therefore mimic marine systems except for the details of the carbonate components and perhaps the high frequency stratigraphic architecture The stacking pattern of sigmoidal building blocks mapped in the presalt unit records the complex sequence stratigraphic architecture of lacustrine carbonate systems The position of the shelf margin through time in prograding intervals of the BVE100 can be conﬁdently correlated only locally within major basement highs suggesting that the lakes may have become locally isolated during times of lake level fall and lowstand rather than being a single continuous lake By the same token regional correlation of carbonate strata on depositional highs and intervening lows during the highstand periods indicates that the highstand lakes were deep very continuous and probably areally comparable to oceanic basins The stacking pattern of mounded marginal facies SF1 Table 1 across the IAU boundary shows the impact of subsidence and accommodation on architectural style Figs 3 6 8 Relatively rapid but laterally variable subsidence across rotating normal fault blocks produced aggradation and local backstepping of the marginal mounds in the Lower Barra Velha BVE300 interval Reduced subsidence rates during thermal isostatic re equilibration allowed signiﬁcant progradation of the shelf margin in the Upper Barra Velha interval Lateral variation in accommodation via differential subsidence at Libra resulted in varying stacking patterns from progradation in the NW sector to aggradation and backstepping in the central sector Fig 12 Large scale base level variations recorded by vertical shifting of the margin of up to 200 m are the probable driver of higher order sequences observed in the BVE100 interval Figs 6 8 Similar variations may have occurred in the BVE200 and BVE300 as well but the dominant aggradation pattern typical of these intervals makes it more difﬁcult to resolve high order sequences owing to the vertical stacking of the seismic facies The antecedent topography inherited from multiphase rifting of the basement exerted an additional major control on the architecture and facies distribution in the presalt carbonate systems Shallow basinal areas with limited accommodation are associated with greater progradation of generally gentler slopes and coalescence of smaller nuclei into larger megaplatforms Minzoni et al 2017 Simo et al 2019 Faulted highs abutting deeper basinal areas and basement drop offs in excess of 500 m are associated with lesser progradation steeper slope angles and in extreme cases aggradation of fringing boundstone or grainstone mounds Fig 11a and margin failure by sector collapse Figs 5a 7b 12c A clear example is recorded in the Sugar Loaf High where carbonate strata of the Barra Velha deposited at the margins of a high relief

up to 350 m along the margins of internal basins perched on the main structural highs are characterized by strongly prograding reﬂectors Figs 6 9 13c Tremblay et al 2014 Buckley et al 2015 Minzoni et al 2017 Similarly progradation was more pronounced where basin inﬁll occurred which effectively decreased water depth and thus the relief of the carbonate margin This is particularly evident in the area between the Sugar Loaf High and the Tupi High where thick basinal accumulation of volcanic rocks and volcanoclastic strata of the BVE300 was associated with later Upper Barra Velha progradation of the shelf margin Figs 3 8 Sediment accumulation at the toe of slope also affected the geometry of the prograding clinoforms Prograding reﬂectors over starved basinal areas are typically tabular with steep linear slopes Fig 10b while prograding reﬂections over areas of thick basinal accumulation display a characteristic climbing and ﬂattening outward geometry Bosellini 1984 and have a distinct exponential shape with tangential lower slope Adams and Kenter 2013 Figs 6 7a 10a Palaeowind direction and surface currents had a signiﬁcant impact on facies distribution and largescale geometries as inferred from consistent asymmetries interpreted as windward leeward effects Fig 9 Palaeoclimatic models indicate southerly to southeasterly trade winds resulting in windward margins facing south and SE and leeward progradational margins facing north and NW The complex topography however may have affected signiﬁcantly the current direction at least locally Sheltered versus open circulation could also result from the presence or absence respectively of persistently exposed features such as islands Fig 11 or simply by slight variations in water depth at the lake ﬂoor The presence of islands along the southeastern margin of the Tupi High is conﬁrmed by onlapping of top Barra Velha reﬂectors on both sides of the palaeohigh Fig 11a Wells that penetrated the sheltered vast and shallow area leeward west of the island encountered a signiﬁcantly greater proportion of ﬁne grained microporous Mg clay rich lithologies than the few that tested the windward side east of the island where sheltering was not effective Fig 11 Removal of the Mg clay however may have also occurred diagenetically at least in part Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 The concave arcuate geometry in plan view of prograding clinoforms within embayments Fig 13 suggests that signiﬁcant lateral transport of carbonate particles by drift currents may have occurred Tremblay et al 2014 Minzoni et al 2017 Arcuate accretion of beach ridges is reported from coastal marine environments as well as large lakes Lake Michigan accumulated up to 5 km of arcuate strand plain sediments in 3000 years Thompson and Baedke 1997 Although the arcuate prograding wedges in the Upper Barra Velha interval are similar in geometry and shape to the ones described from modern lakes the vertical dimension of the clinoforms up to 300 m is much larger in the presalt section attesting to signiﬁcantly deeper lakes and perhaps stronger storm activity Conclusions Despite their peculiar petrographic and textural composition the presalt lacustrine carbonate intervals of the Santos Basin show all of the salient large scale sequence stratigraphic characteristics known and described from marine carbonate systems developed in both active and passive tectonic settings Synrift and post rift carbonate systems in the Santos Basin are characterized by complex stratigraphy The large scale architecture as interpreted from calibrated seismic data was controlled primarily by subsidence patterns antecedent topography and the production curve of the carbonate factory The spatial and temporal accumulation pattern of basinal siliciclastic and volcanic strata contributed to the determination of progradation versus aggradation geometries and controlled the shape of the slope by modifying the platform relief High amplitude baselevel ﬂuctuations modiﬁed but did not dramatically alter the basic architectural evolution of the carbonate systems Shelf margins aggraded and backstepped during rifting atop horst structures or tilted basement blocks where asymmetric evolution of the platform resulted from active rotation of the underlying basement The depositional architecture of carbonate margins off the structural highs during the sag phase when thermal post rift subsidence prevailed is strongly progradational to downstepping reﬂecting lower subsidence rates and perhaps increased production rates Widespread downstepping in the Upper Barra Velha suggests exposure and possibly erosion of the shelf top prior to deposition of the salt The sigmoidal geometry of the individual sequences indicates a tapering production with water depth similar to that described from marine analogues The steepness and size of inclined reﬂections interpreted as slope deposits imply that water depth was signiﬁcant up to several hundred metres and the occurrence of arcuate strand plain beach

Seismic Interpretation of presalt carbonate reservoirs of the Búzios Field Santos Basin Pedro Henrique Cunha de Macedo1 Débora Ribeiro Barretto1 Igor de Andrade Neves1 Francisco Romério Abrantes Junior1 Wagner Moreira Lupinacci1 1Exploratory Interpretation and Reservoir Characterization Group GIECAR Department of Geology and Geophysics Universidade Federal Fluminense Niterói RJ Brazil Copyright 2021 SBGf Sociedade Brasileira de Geofísica th This paper was prepared for presentation during the 17 International Congress of the Brazilian Geophysical Society held in Rio de Janeiro Brazil 16 19August 2021 Contents of this paper were reviewed by the Technical Committee of the 17th International Congress of the Brazilian Geophysical Society and do not necessarily represent any position of the SBGf its officers or members Electronic reproduction or storage of any part of this paper for commercial purposes without the written consent of the Brazilian Geophysical Society is prohibited Abstract The Brazilian presalt carbonate reservoirs are one of the most requested places for oil and gas industry exploration due to its production capacity Oil and gas companies are often taking place to collect information about geology and the reservoirs characteristics to consequently improve production results Seismic interpretation is mandatory to understand the geology always thinking about reducing all the risks during exploration Seismic and well data are commonly used together as a way to comprehend geological history and provide a good reservoir characterization In this paper we performed the seismic interpretation on presalt carbonate reservoirs of Búzios Field within the isopach maps strategy and TecVA attribute As results we achieved better definition of faults distribution and tectonics behavior determined the main interval thickness and the possibility of coquina banks occurrence Introduction Formation Both formations are important presalt exploration targets and have quite different sedimentarytectonic contexts The objective of this work is to understand the evolution of the rift and sag phases in the Búzios Field area through the integration of well and seismic data This article intends to collaborate for a better understanding of the paleoenvironments of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations We interpreted four important unconformities in the presalt zone i Economic basement ii Jiquiá Buracica unconformity separates Piçarras from Itapema Formations iii Pré Alagoas unconformity the top of coquina deposits and acts dividing the Itapema from Lower Barra Velha Formations and iv the Base of Salt Geological Setting The Santos Basin is located on the southeastern Brazilian margin bounded by the Campos Basin at the North and the Pelotas Basin at the South Santos Basin is one of the most extensive offshore Brazilian basins with an area of 352 000 km² and a current water depth of up to 3 000 m The main structural features are the Cabo Frio High to the Northeast and the Florianópolis Platform to the Southwest the Santos hinge line to the west which marks the external western limit of the salt Ariri Formation and the São Paulo plateau to the East The Búzios Field is located at the Santos Basin Figure 1 The Santos Basin represents the largest presalt exploration and production area in Brazil It currently accounts for more than 70 of the country s oil and gas production ANP 2021 In this context the Búzios Field is considered a super giant field with an estimated volume in place of 3 058 million bbl of oil equivalent and in January 2021 the outstanding result of 146 524 Bbl d was achieved by the platform with the highest oil production in the country located in Búzios Field The carbonate sedimentation processes are extremely sensitive to climatic factors hydrodynamics basin tectonics and morphology These differences might cause vertical and lateral heterogeneity effects in seismic facies Porta 2015 In the Santos Basin the main reservoirs are found inner coquinas a type of sedimentary rock composed mainly by shells and their fragments of the Itapema Formation Castro 2019 and in the spherulitic laminate shrubs and reworked facies of the Barra Velha Formation Gomes et al 2020 Castro 2019 showed that the Itapema Formation in the Búzios Field is less influenced by the presence of fines and has better permeabilities than the Barra Velha Figure 1 Búzios Field Location adapted from ANP 2016 According to Moreira et al 2007 the geological history of the Santos Basin can be divided into three phases Rift Post rift and Drift The Rift phase presents extension efforts of separation between the South American and African plates which started from the Lower Cretaceous Muniz and Bosence 2015 describe that the sequence of tectonic events that caused the fragmentation of Gondwana would have started from the stretching and thinning process of the continental crust triggering a Seventeenth International Congress of the Brazilian Geophysical Society

SEISMIC INTERPRETATION IN PRESALT RESERVOIRS 2 rifting process This fragmentation consisted of a mixed process controlled by lithospheric stretching and thermal anomalies The crystalline basement of the Santos Basin generated in the context of Gondwana s amalgamation is characterized by granites and gneisses of pre Cambrian age of the Coastal Complex and metasediments of the Ribeira Strip Moreira et al 2007 During the main rifting process around 145 Ma the Northwest portion remained closed while a wedge was extended to the south along the east of South America Szatmari and Milani 2016 According to the authors volcanism would have been absent where the lithosphere was thick An important consequence during the Rift Phase was the space forming mechanism for sedimentary accommodation in an extensional tectonic setting and widespread normal faults generation due to mechanical subsidence process besides causing reactivation of faults in the Precambrian basement Mohriak 2008 Strugale et al 2021 point out that the different basement compositions represent another determining factor for the way the rifting process takes place Where the basement is heterogeneous the pre existing fabric was reactivated whenever its orientation was favorable producing faults as the extension direction rotates whereas low to very low angle basement fabric were cross cut by rift faults Where the basement was homogeneous and more stable only the previous formed faults remain active throughout the rifting Another effect observed was the contribution and influence of thermal anomalies in the region of the Santos Basin which would have been responsible for inducing the strain softening process since the beginning of the rift leading to the development of uplifted areas ANP LEBAC 2003 The importance of understanding the different processes related to the rifting phase is the influence during the deposition of the overlying sedimentary layers The rift super sequence is composed of continental siliciclastics talc stevensite ooids with interbedded lacustrine coquinas and organic rich shales of the Piçarras and Itapema formations consisting of essentially continental sediments Szatmari and Milani 2016 Furthermore during the Rift Phase the sediments from the bottom of the Barra Velha Formation were deposited Buckley et al 2015 These deposits show a prominent wedge geometry which may represent differences in the faults movement rate that consequently created space for accommodation Thus they state that this may represent an increase in the sedimentation rate at the top of the Barra Velha Formation when compared to the Piçarras and Itapema formations The post rift sequence also known as the sag phase is represented by the Upper Barra Velha Formation which is characterized by shrubs spherulite laminate and reworked facies Gomes et al 2020 precipitated nonmarine carbonate successions Wright Barnett 2015 The absence of unambiguous palaeoecologically significant fossils together with the presence of the mineral stevensite rather than marine derived evaporates sulphates and chlorides indicates an alkaline lacustrine setting with a volcanic source area Wright Barnett 2015 In short the presalt reservoir rocks are in the Itapema and Barra Velha formations The Itapema Formation is represented by grainstones to bivalves coquinas wackestones and bioclastic packstones carbonate shales and dark shales rich in organic matter which sometimes also work as source rocks The Barra Velha Formation is composed of carbonates deposited in lacustrine environment with a multiplicity of facies from boundstones and grainstones to mudstones The Itapema Formation is limited at the bottom by the Jiquiá Buracica unconformity 126 4 Ma and at the top by the Pré Alagoas unconformity while the Barra Velha Formation is limited at the bottom by the Pré Alagoas unconformity and at the top by the Base of Salt Moreira et al 2007 Seismic Interpretation The seismic data provides information about the regional context depositional system tectonic history and allows inferring geological features and heterogeneities favoring better understanding of sedimentary basins The interpretation of seismic reflection terminations such as onlap downlap toplap and erosive truncations are the main criteria for the recognition of stratigraphic units Figure 2 They are essential to better understand what happened allowing to foresee the current geological behavior Then the identification of seismic parameters was made to recognize information about the depositional environment source of sediments and the geological context in which the seismic facies were deposited For this study we used a PSDM volume post stacked depth migration and applied a structural smoothing filter to remove part of migration smile noises Data from 15 wells Figure 3 helped in the seismic interpretation from the identification of the boundaries between the lithostratigraphic units Previous works were also fundamental for a better understanding of the sedimentary tectonic history of the study area Seventeenth International Congress of the Brazilian

major research interest The huge extension and volume and unusual textural and compositional features are key elements for understanding the tectonic structural stratigraphic and sedimentological generation and early evolution of the region as well as potentially of other lacustrine carbonate systems A systematic petrographic and petrophysical study has been performed on the Lower Cretaceous lacustrine carbonate reservoirs from northern Campos Basin Offshore Brazil in order to unravel the main controls on the origin and evolution of pore systems The main lithologic types recognized in the rift section are bivalve gastropod grainstones and rudstones arenites constituted by ooids of syngenetic magnesian clay minerals mostly stevensite and dolostones while stevensitic claystones with calcite spherulites fascicular calcite crusts intraclastic rudstones and grainstones and dolostones are the main lithologic types in the sag section The eogenetic evolution of bioclastic reservoirs was controlled by the balance between dissolution and neomorphism of the aragonitic bivalve and gastropod bioclasts favoring either the generation of poorly connected moldic porosity or the preservation of well connected interparticle porosity The stevensitic arenites were strongly affected by meteoric dissolution and replacement by dolomite and silica related to regional uplift and erosion after the rift phase which generated highly heterogeneous pore systems with moldic intercrystalline vugular and microcrystalline pores Stevensitic claystones that are replaced by calcite spherulites and dolomite normally show low porosity but locally constitute reservoirs where secondary porosity was generated by stevensite dissolution The precipitation of crystal shrubs of fascicular optic calcite in coalescent crusts generated growth framework primary porosity which was reduced mostly by dolomite cementation or enlarged by dissolution enhancing their permeability Non coalescent calcite crusts contain abundant syngenetic magnesian clay minerals Their porosity is related to dissolution of these clays which generated poor permeability Intraclastic grainstones and rudstones are compacted and cemented or rich in clay matrix hybrid packstones Where they display preserved interparticle primary porosity or matrix dissolution they may have good porosity and permeability The heterogeneous dolomitization of both the rift and the sag deposits either destroyed their primary or early diagenetic porosity or generated high porosity and permeability values in the dolostones Relationships between replacement and compaction indicate that most of the diagenetic processes occurred during eodiagenesis controlled mostly by the instability of the aragonite in the bioclastic reservoirs and of the stevensite in the claystones ooidal arenites and fascicular calcite crusts This study characterizes the major primary and diagenetic aspects of the pre salt reservoirs providing insights on the evolution of their porosity and permeability This is expected to contribute to the prediction of quality during exploration and to enhance hydrocarbon recovery from producing oilﬁelds as well as to increase the understanding of the origin evolution and quality distribution in analogous lacustrine reservoirs INTRODUCTION In the last decade giant hydrocarbon accumulations were discovered in lacustrine carbonate reservoirs below Aptian evaporites along the South Atlantic conjugate margins Carminatti et al 2009 Sallet et al 2016 These reservoirs together with important discoveries in China have attracted significant interest in the exploration and scientific research of continental carbonates The genesis and evolution of pre salt reservoirs represent a geologic enigma that has puzzled many major researchers by their huge extension and volume their unusual textural and compositional features and by what they will reveal about the South Atlantic tectonic structural stratigraphic and sedimentological generation and early evolution On the other hand knowledge of continental carbonates is relatively restricted when compared to that of marine carbonates

1286 R HERLINGER JR ET AL world In this sense the recent discoveries of huge hydrocarbon accumulations in lacustrine carbonates from Brazil Africa and China have attracted intense scientific interest for a better understanding of the formation and evolutionary processes of these reservoirs Modern and ancient lacustrine carbonates are characterized by a great variability of facies and mineral species having been studied for decades Lacustrine carbonates strongly contrast with marine carbonates While the main control on the environmental genetic conditions of marine carbonates is geological age Moore 2001 lacustrine carbonates have their genesis controlled by local geological settings such as tectonics climate fauna and specific geochemical conditions that can form very particular deposits Davis and Wilkinson 1983 De Wett et al 2002 Dunagan and Turner 2004 Gierlowski Kordesch 2009 Fedorchuk 2014 The deposition of lacustrine carbonates is controlled by several factors including hydrological input and output of surface waters precipitation and groundwater flow sedimentary input and temperature variations Platt and Wright 1991 Tucker and Wright 1991 Water geochemistry plays a major role in lacustrine environments because it controls a number of processes including development of microbial communities Riding and Liang 2005 Vasconcelos et al 2006 Spadafora et al 2010 abiotic precipitation of carbonates Riding 2008 Wright and Barnett 2015 and clay minerals Calvo et al 1999 Pozo and Casas 1999 Furquim et al 2008 and the development of algae ostracodes and mollusks bivalves or gastropods Casanova 1986 Renaut et al 1986 Vincens et al 1986 Harris et al 1994 Frogley et al 2002 The pore systems of carbonate reservoirs both continental and marine show great diversity of pore types and wide heterogeneity Choquette and Pray 1970 Mazzullo and Harris 1991 Lucia 1995 Moore 2001 Mazzullo 2004 Lønøy 2006 Ahr 2008 Porosity is controlled by many factors including the interplay of physical chemical and biological depositional processes which are overprinted by intense diagenesis due to the chemical reactivity of carbonates as well as by fracturing and hydrothermal processes Ehrenberg et al 2006 Ehrenberg et al 2012 Chafetz 2013 Brigaud et al 2014 In most cases the porosity evolution patterns are controlled by a combination of mineral composition fabric and diagenetic conditions The carbonate permeability frequently correlates poorly with porosity due to heterogeneous porous framework where the original fabric can be intensely modified by diagenetic processes Du rrast and Siegesmund 1999 Weger et al 2009 van der Land et al 2013 Rezende and Pope 2015 The study of porosity geometry is important in characterization of carbonate reservoirs supporting petrophysical interpretation and improving predictability of reservoir quality and heterogeneity Basan et al 1997 Mountjoy and Marquez 1997 Eichenseer et al 1999 Machel 2005 The aim of this work is to discuss the impact of diagenesis on the evolution of porosity and permeability of pre salt lacustrine carbonates from northern Campos Basin through the combination of petrographic and petrophysical analyses This work contributes to the prediction of quality during exploration and aims to enhance recovery from producing oilfields as well as to increase the understanding of the origin evolution and quality distribution in analogous lacustrine reservoirs worldwide GEOLOGICAL SETTING The Campos Basin is a passive margin basin situated on the northern coast of the Rio de Janeiro State Brazil Fig 1A extending to the southern coast of the Espı rito Santo State being geographically located between parallels 218 and 238 S The basin is located between the Santos Basin to the south bounded by the Cabo Frio volcanic high and the Espı rito Santo Basin to the north bounded by the Vito ria High The Campos Basin was formed under an extensional tectonic regime during the breakup of the Gondwana Continent during Late Jurassic Early Cretaceous preceding the final separation of South America and Africa JSR and the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean Rabinowitz and LaBrecque 1979 Austin and Uchupi 1982 Nu rnberg and Mu ller 1991 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Guardado et al 2000 The formation of the Atlantic Ocean started with crustal thinning and breakup of Sa o Francisco Congo Rio de La Plata Kalahari cratons accreted during the Eoproterozoic orogeny South Atlantic formation began during the Jurassic with rifting between Argentina and southern Africa and through the Equatorial Margin Szatmari 2000 Meisling et al 2001 Mohriak et al 2008 The rupture of the central portion controlled by a resistant cratonic core Sa o Francisco Congo Craton occurred later in the Hauterivian Clemson et al 1997 Karner and Driscoll 1999 resulting in the development of a narrow rift zone in this region The Santos Espı rito Santo and Campos basins located on a Proterozoic fold belt developed wider basins Mohriak et al 2008 Rosendahl et al 2005 The Barremian to Aptian rift stage was characterized by increased lithospheric extension and asthenospheric uplift McKenzie 1978 White and McKenzie 1988 associated with extensive intracratonic tholeiitic volcanism Turner et al 1994 Mohriak et al 2008 Torsvik et al 2009 Elongated deep lakes formed parallel to basement lineaments and were filled with both volcanic and sedimentary rocks Dias et al 1988 Mizusaki et al 1988 The presence of transfer zones played an important role in the partitioning of the rifted margin in subbasins Meisling et al 2001 Muniz 2014 The Aptian sag stage is preceded by uplift and erosion of the rift section resulting in a regional unconformity Karner and Driscoll 1999 Dias 2005 Winter et al 2007 The initial sag sedimentation included carbonate Mg clays and clastics which are overlain by evaporites formed in an arid climate under influx of incursions of marine seawater Abraha o and Warme 1990 Karner and Gambo a 2007 The last stage drift phase is characterized by the development of oceanic crust and a passive margin Chang et al 1988 Chang et al 1992 Aslanian et al 2009 The Lagoa Feia Group originally defined by Schaller 1973 as the Lagoa Feia Formation unconformably overlies pre rift flood basalts from the Cabiu nas Formation comprising the nonmarine to transitional sequences from the Campos Basin Subsequently the Lagoa Feia Formation has been subdivided into four distinct depositional sequences bounded by unconformities including the Basal Clastic Sequence the Talc Stevensitic Sequence the Coquinas Sequence and the Clastic Evaporitic Sequence Dias et al 1988 The last two sequences are separated by the pre Alagoas unconformity More recently Winter et al 2007 subdivided the Lagoa Feia Formation into several formations elevating it to group status Fig 1B The rift phase Coqueiros Formation is composed mainly of bioclastic rudstones and grainstones informally known as coquinas interfingered with proximal clastic sediments of the Itabapoana Formation towards the western margin of the basin The Coqueiros Formation consists mainly of bioclasts of bivalve mollusks with subordinate amounts of gastropods and ostracods Some authors have proposed depositional and sedimentological models of bioclastic deposits Castro et al 1981 separated the bioclastic deposits into two types detrital coquinas consisting of bioclasts and noncarbonate grains talc stevensite ooids and peloids and mud intraclasts and pure coquinas composed entirely of bioclasts Bertani and Carozzi 1985a recognized several microfacies separating sequences dominated by bivalves and by ostracods and according to variations on composition grain size matrix and cement content These authors related the distribution of microfacies to two distinct depositional models playalake settings dominated by ostracods and pluvial lake settings dominated by bivalve mollusks Carvalho et al 2000 recognized seven main depositional environments based on facies associations including bioclastic beaches bioclastic sandy beaches and marginal lacustrine settings bioclastic sheet and bar fringes consisting of shell debris deposited by storm events bioaccumulation banks and deep lacustrine settings Recently Goldberg et al 2017 interpreted based on the integration of quantitative petrography sedimentology and

1288 JSR R HERLINGER JR ET AL FIG 2 Schematic correlation of the studied wells showing distance between wells units gamma ray logs and facies succession stratigraphy that the bioclastic rudstones correspond mostly to gravitational deposits resedimented from structural highs to deeper lacustrine settings throughout the rift section of the basin Sag phase deposits from the Macabu Formation were referred to by Dias et al 1988 as carbonate facies consisting of nodular diagenetic limestones and laminated limestones probably algal in origin stromatolites Later Dias 2005 interpreted laminites and microbial stromatolites as supratidal and upper intertidal facies overlain by lower intertidal clay rich facies and subtidal mudstones deposited in an epicontinental context with extensive pre evaporitic clastics located in shallow proximal regions Muniz and Bosence 2015 interpreted the absence of both marine biota and normal freshwater biota such as charophytes and the presence of nonmarine ostracods as evidence of a brackish water lacustrine environment refuting the presence of tidal influence on microbial development However recent interpretation suggests that most deposits from the Macabu Formation are chemical precipitates controlled by the geochemistry of alkaline lacustrine waters Wright 2011 2012 2013 Tosca and Wright 2014 Wright and Barnett 2015 identified a typical cyclothem as composed of three main components mud grade laminated carbonates accumulated in flooding phase calcite spherulites in a matrix of Mgsilicates and calcitic shrub like growths trigged by evaporation controlled by pH and ionic activity METHODS This study is based on 780 samples from cores and sidewall plugs collected from five wells Fig 2 The applied methods include optical petrography plane polarized light PL crossed polarized light XPL ultraviolet fluorescence UVF cathodoluminescence CL scanning electron microscopy SEM X ray diffraction XRD and petrophysical

JSR LACUSTRINE PRE SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS FROM NORTHERN CAMPOS BASIN analysis In order to characterize the primary and diagenetic constituents the pore types and their relationships optical petrography was performed on thin sections impregnated with blue epoxy resin 139 thin sections were quantified and described in detail and 641 thin sections were classified according main constituents textures and pore types Pore types were classified according to Choquette and Pray 1970 Thin sections were stained for carbonate identification with an acid solution of alizarin red and potassium ferrocyanide Dickson 1965 A Zeiss Colibri fluorescence light emitting diode LED UV microscope was used to evaluate presence of organic matter and relations of replacement between fluorescent minerals In order to identify diagenetic carbonate phases cathodoluminescence CL microscopy was performed in a Cambridge Image Technology Ltd CITL luminoscope CL analyses were performed in CL8200 MK5 2 equipment coupled to Leica microscope under operating conditions of 300 mA and 17 kV Scanning electron microscopy SEM analyses using backscattered and secondary electrons were executed in ZEISS EVO LS15 or JEOL JSM 6490LV electron microscopes both equipped with OXFORD Inca Aztec energy dispersed spectrometers EDS in order to investigate paragenetic relationships between primary and diagenetic constituents and to identify the elemental mineral composition in representative rock fragments and thin sections X ray diffraction XRD analyses of the clay fraction including air dried glycolsaturated and heated treatments were used to confirm the clay mineral species Petrophysical analyses were performed on plugs cut from cores and on sidewall cores in order to determine porosity and permeability according to norm API RP 40 1998 Mercury injection capillary pressure MICP analyses were performed on a Micrometrics AutoPore IV 9500 equipment to determine the pore throat size distribution of representative samples RESULTS Petrography The studied reservoirs in the rift section are composed of massive bioclastic rudstones and grainstones coquinas about 80 meters thick and by stevensitic arenites that occur at the top of the section described only in Well 4 Fig 2 Overlying these reservoirs there are crusts of calcite shrubs and stevensitic claystones that occur in millimetric to decimetric intercalations Additionally intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked spherulites and fragments of the crusts are found intercalated with the calcite crusts and stevensitic claystones Hybrid siltstones siliciclastic siltstones and claystones and microbial laminites are concentrated at the top of the sag section and at the bottom of Well 2 and are not considered reservoirs Bivalve Gastropod Rudstones and Grainstones Coquinas The bioclastic grainstones 9 of the samples and rudstones 91 of the samples are mostly massive poorly to well sorted with a chaotic or subparallel fabric The primary constituents are bioclasts of bivalves gastropods and ostracods Bivalves are the main component composing 100 of primary constituents in 64 of the samples Fig 3A Bivalves always occur disarticulated and their degree of reworking is widely variable Bivalve bioclasts are frequently broken or dissolved and have dimensions ranging from 0 07 to 25 mm average ¼ 2 3 mm in the thin sections Gastropods are observed in 36 of the samples and are typically whole and not abraded Fig 3B with preserved intraparticle porosity The ostracod bioclasts are whole sometimes articulated and occasionally recrystallized Ostracods occur in 8 of the samples and are the main primary component of grainstones Fig 3C in two samples Intraclasts of carbonate mud volcanic and siliciclastic grains occur in small amounts in the bioclastic rudstones and grainstones 1289 Calcite is the main cement of bioclastic rudstones and grainstones The bioclasts are covered by continuous rims of microcrystalline to prismatic calcite Fig 3D Drusy calcite frequently is the main interparticle cement Dissolution of bioclasts generates intraparticle and moldic pores which are filled by drusy Fig 3E and blocky calcite Subordinate cements that have filled interparticle pores include blocky coarse mosaic and microcrystalline calcite Recrystallization of the bivalve and gastropod bioclasts to blocky calcite is common masking the original fabric of the bioclastic rudstones and grainstones Bivalves are dull CL whilst intraparticle and interparticle cements are red in CL Fig 3F Bivalves and gastropods were either dissolved or neomorphosed calcitized commonly showing a heterogeneous range from total dissolution with variable intensity of calcite cementation of the intraparticle and moldic porosity to total neomorphism The distinction between neomorphism and moldic pores cementation is in many cases difficult without CL Calcitization of aragonitic bivalve and gastropod bioclasts often forms a mosaic of calcite crystals marked by fine lines of inclusions delineating the original structure of the shell Fig 3D In contrast the intraparticle and moldic pores were filled by drusiform Fig 3E and blocky calcite Dolomite occurs in 15 of the samples as a minor constituent 5 in the bioclastic rudstones and grainstones of Wells 3 and 5 and more rarely in Well 2 Blocky and saddle dolomite fill locally interparticle intraparticle moldic and vugular pores Dolostones up to 10 meters thick occur in Well 5 as a product of replacement of the bioclastic rocks These rocks are composed of small rhombohedral and rarely of saddle dolomite crystals Sucrosic dolostones preserve partially the shape of the bioclasts Fig 4A Silica occurs in 44 of the samples rarely making up more than 2 of the rock volume Chalcedony and quartz as blocky prismatic coarse mosaic and microcrystalline often occur in small amounts mainly replacing calcite and rarely filling interparticle intraparticle moldic and vugular porosity in bioclastic rudstones and grainstones Microcrystalline quartz rims locally cover bioclasts Drusy quartz locally fills moldic and vugular porosity Displacive pore filling interparticle quartz cement was observed in 4 of the samples Fig 4B Bioclastic grainstones and rudstones have a poor diversity of diagenetic minerals Barite BaSO4 and celestine SrSO4 are rare filling interparticle porosity or replacing calcite cements and bivalves The aluminum phosphate sulfate APS minerals svanbergite SrAl3 PO4 SO4 OH 6 and goyazite SrHAl3 PO4 2 OH 6 locally replace mud intraclasts Fig 4C in bioclastic rudstones The main pore types in bioclastic rudstones are interparticle intraparticle moldic and vugular Figs 3A D E 4D E Bioclastic grainstones have predominantly intercrystalline and moldic porosity Figs 3C 4F Dolomitized rudstones and grainstones are both rich in intercrystalline porosity Fig 4A Well 2 shows a cyclical variation of predominant pore types along the studied interval from moldic to interparticle and to moldic again The samples of Well 3 display predominance of moldic porosity and those of Well 5 of interparticle porosity Well 1 was not sampled in the bioclastic succession and Well 4 was poorly sampled Stevensitic Arenites Massive well to moderately sorted arenites composed of stevensitic ooids and stevensite coated carbonate particles occur at the top of the rift section only in Well 4 forming an interval about 50 meters thick Fig 2 The occurrence of these ooids is very common in the rift section of the Campos Basin Previous studies pointed to a composition of stevensite kerolite and talc for such ooids Bertani and Carozzi 1985a 1985b Rehim et al 1986 Abraha o and Warme 1990 Armelenti et al 2016 These clay ooids are commonly dissolved and replaced by dolomite and quartz and often are deformed The diagenetic patterns of the stevensitic arenites are very heterogeneous Frequently the ooids are cemented by dolomite or quartz and almost completely silicified

deformed Even when partially dissolved or replaced by carbonates or silica clay particles and laminated aggregates are blue yellow and light brown to orange UV fluorescent Fig 6D E SEM analyses show poor crystallinity even at high magnification Semiquantitative EDS analyses indicate considerable amounts of SiO2 about 65 and MgO about 30 and low contents of Al2O3 about 2 FeO K2O CaO and NaO2 occur in amounts below 1 The elemental composition of the clays and their XRD analysis indicate that the dominant mineral is stevensite Silt to sand size siliciclastic grains are sparsely mixed with the stevensite deposits usually in less than 1 Hybrid sandstones and siltstones with quartz biotite muscovite orthoclase and plagioclase grains are rare Hybrid siltstones are particularly abundant at the base of the sag section in Well 2 within an interval about 100 meters thick and at the top of the sag section in all wells Fig 2 Phosphatic bioclasts such as fish scales teeth vertebrae and other bones occur scattered or concentrated being common in Well 1 locally together with other phosphatic grains Ostracods are frequently concentrated in the laminations Fig 6F and occur articulated with limited reworking Their partial to total replacement by quartz or dolomite is common in 34 of samples Calcite spherulites are the most common diagenetic constituent in the stevensite deposits occurring as an important component in all studied wells Figs 6A 7A B Spherulites 0 15 to 2 5 mm in diameter average ¼ 0 8 mm frequently replaced the stevensitic claystones and hybrid siltstones

are abundant coalescing as irregular levels Fig 7B sutured by microstylolites Although the spherulites were recrystallized resulting in changes in crystal shape and size many have good preservation of the original fibrous structure Fig 7A C Partial replacement of the spherulites by chalcedony and quartz is frequent 31 of the samples Spherical to subspherical low magnesium calcite pisoliths 1 mm to 5 cm are abundant in Well 1 Fig 2 showing fascicular optic and or radialfibrous texture similar to crusts but with concentric growth Fig 7D Some pisoliths are formed by thin concentric laminae 0 5 mm while others are formed by divergent coalescence of fascicular optic calcite aggregates reaching up to 2 mm in diameter The pisoliths are deformed and recrystallized Pisolithic aggregates are not fluorescent and seem to replace stevensite like spherulites inside unconsolidated sediments Dolomite replaces stevensite in nearly all the samples Figs 6B E F 7A B Stevensite laminae are replaced and deformed by blocky dolomite Figs 6B 7A Saddle dolomite replaces the primary and diagenetic constituents in 12 of the samples Dolomite frequently totally replaces the stevensite and calcite spherulites In the hybrid siltstones authigenic illite smectite clays are identified in XRD Intercalations of millimetric to centimetric levels of cherts and dolostones along stylolitic contacts are formed by replacement of laminated clay deposits Dolomite fluoresces blue green yellow or brown under UVF Fig 6E while silica is brown to green under UVF when replacing stevensite Cubic blocky and microcrystalline pyrite although scarce 1 occurs in most of the described thin sections mainly replacing the stevensite and other primary or diagenetic constituents Pseudocubic microcrystalline svanbergite goyazite SrAl3 PO4 SO4 OH 6 SrHAl3 PO4 2 OH 6 are recognized in SEM analyses associated with silicification and dolomitization Partial to total dissolution of stevensite is very common Fig

more commonly fascicular optic crystal aggregates sensu Kendall 1977 i e plumose or increasingly divergent constitute the main reservoirs of the sag section These calcite aggregates grew predominantly in a vertical to near vertical orientation Fig 8A B with an average individual length of 1 55 mm up to 12 mm encrusting various deposits The fascicular aggregates commonly display a shrub shape that coalesces both vertically and horizontally forming calcite crusts of variable thickness up to 80 cm thick In some cases fibrous calcite aggregates form millimetric continuous and isopachous palisade crusts Fig 8C intercalated with microcrystalline calcite or dolomite siliciclastic mud or stevensite laminae Recrystallization is frequent generating apparently massive forms although with remnants of the original fibrous crystal fabric recognizable in polarized light and in SEM images Fig 8D The engulfment and replacement of siliciclastic grains stevensite peloids and ostracod bioclasts by fascicular optic calcite aggregates is common In some cases thin laminations occur within the aggregates CL images show a homogeneous red luminescence pattern Fig 9A and UVF is very weak or absent Microbial remnants were not identified in SEM analyses Dolomite is the most common diagenetic constituent filling interstitial growth framework pores in calcite crusts 78 of the samples Fig 9B C with blocky microcrystalline and more rarely mosaic habits Saddle dolomite occurs filling growth framework and vugular porosity as well as replacing the primary and diagenetic constituents Partial to total

clays identified in SEM Fig 9F and XRD occur in the calcite crusts mainly replacing detrital interstitial components Growth framework porosity in the interstices among coalescent fascicular calcite aggregates constitutes the main type of primary porosity in calcite crusts Fig 8A These pores are enlarged by dissolution of the aggregates Figs 8A 9B C Dolomite cement is the main reducer of growth

JSR LACUSTRINE PRE SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS FROM NORTHERN CAMPOS BASIN DISCUSSION Eogenetic Evolution of Bivalve Gastropod Rudstones and Grainstones Most of the diagenesis of the bioclastic rocks occurred before compaction Fig 12 as evidenced by the distribution of the blocky and drusiform interparticle pore filling cements The bioclastic rocks followed three main evolution pathways controlled by distinct eogenetic conditions Fig 13 Pathway 1 was probably connected to active circulation of interstitial fluids undersaturated with respect to aragonite most likely lacustrine freshwaters during more humid periods which promoted intense dissolution of the aragonitic bivalves cf Morse and Mackenzie 1990 Moore and Wade 2013 and the precipitation of calcite prismatic rims in interparticle and intraparticle pores Fig 3E Pathway 2 was promoted probably where less dilute fluids initially allowed preservation of the bioclasts cf James and Choquette 1984 Caron and Nelson 2009 and precipitation of calcite prismatic rims and drusiform cement followed by extensive dissolution of bioclasts and generation of moldic porosity Fig 4F Pathway 3 developed where limited circulation of fluids slightly supersaturated with respect to aragonite favored the precipitation of thin calcite rims the neomorphism of the bioclasts Fig 3D and the preservation of interparticle porosity The common alternation of intervals with predominance of neomorphism and of dissolution indicates frequent oscillation between these interpreted environmental conditions Such diagenetic variations may be related to climatic control of the composition and level of lacustrine waters or to tectonically driven hydraulic gradients probably related to faulting along the rift margins generating patterns that cannot be correlated among the studied wells This paragenetic evolution of the bioclastic rudstones and grainstones Fig 12 differs from that of equivalent rocks from the central and southern parts of the basin where there is a predominance of aragonite neomorphism in relation to dissolution Bertani and Carozzi 1985b Altenhofen 2013 Muniz 2014 Goldberg et al 2017 Typical vadose features such as pendant or meniscus cements cf James and Choquette 1984 infiltration of clay and or silt and development of soils and calcretes were not observed in the bioclastic rocks indicating that exposure was not significant in the succession The locally observed displacive silica cementation of bioclastic rocks was therefore not related to the formation of silcretes under subaerial arid conditions Ross and Chiarenzelli 1985 Khalaf 1988 Hesse 1989 Murray 1990 Since the bioclastic deposits are poor in siliciclastic grains such early silica precipitation was probably derived from dissolution of the stevensitic ooids Origin and Diagenesis of Stevensite Recent studies indicate that Mg clays are formed from Si Mg hydrated gel precursors Tosca and Wright 2014 Wright and Barnett 2015 which evolve to stevensite kerolite talc and other Mg clay mineral phases in highly alkaline lacustrine and palustrine environments Rehim et al 1986 Pozo and Casas 1999 Experimental studies show that this evolution depends on a number of environmental factors including pH salinity temperature and ionic content Jones 1986 Tosca and Masterson 2014 The alkaline conditions needed for stevensite precipitation ph 10 were recurrent during the rift evolution as stevensite arenites occur in different stages and areas of the Campos rift Bertani and Carozzi 1985a 1985b Armelenti et al 2016 Goldberg et al 2017 These conditions were very different from the fresh water environments colonized by bivalves and gastropods The common mixture of stevensite ooids and peloids with bivalve bioclasts in the Campos Basin rift section indicates their extensive gravitational resedimentation in deeper lacustrine environments throughout the evolution of the rift Goldberg et al 2017 Pozo and Casas 1999 suggested that gel coagulation would result in granular clay particles which could explain the common peloidal habit of 1301 stevensite The habit of stevensite could be related to the energy of its depositional environment as observed for glauconite berthierine and other syngenetic clay minerals e g Van Houten and Purucker 1984 Odin 1988 As for these clays the stevensitic ooids were probably formed in environments with some agitation by waves or currents while the laminated stevensitic claystones were certainly deposited in low energy environments The peloids were probably formed in environments of an energy level between that for the formation of the ooids and that for the laminated claystones According to Tosca and Wright 2015 the high sensitivity to pCO2 pH and the fast dissolution kinetics due to the high specific surface area favors the eogenetic dissolution of Mg clays The common dissolution and replacement of stevensite by silica and dolomite probably occurred mostly during eodiagenesis Fig 12 controlled by variations in the chemistry of the lacustrine waters As observed in other rift lakes e g Renaut et al 1986 De Wet et al 2002 dilution of lake waters during more humid periods or input of CO2 by magmatic and hydrothermal activity may have promoted the dissolution of Mg clays liberating silica and magnesium and favoring the precipitation of silica and dolomite Further dissolution of stevensite ooids and peloids after cementation generated abundant moldic and intraparticle porosity Fig 5 Intense dissolution silicification and dolomitization are observed in stevensitic arenites just below the pre Alagoas regional unconformity suggesting alteration in a subaerial environment during post rift uplift and exposure Genesis of Calcite Spherulites The most abundant eogenetic constituent replacing stevensite are spherulites of calcite which occur throughout the sag succession Figs 6A 7A B The formation of spherulites has been interpreted to be favored in the interior of inorganic gels although the viscous medium is not a prerequisite for spherulite growth Beck and Andreassen 2010 Shtukenberg et al 2012 Our petrographic evidence shows that the development of spherulites occurred inside the stevensite laminations or the hybrid siltstones displacing and replacing the original unconsolidated sediment suggesting early diagenetic conditions Laboratory studies have reported that the development of calcite spherulites is favored in alkaline conditions with high concentrations of silica and magnesium Garcı a Ruiz 2000 Meister et al 2011 which agrees with the interpreted alkaline lacustrine environment Most of the spherulites show no visible nuclei and some display stevensite peloids siliciclastic grains and ostracod bioclasts as nuclei Natural and synthetic spherulites interpreted as formed by direct microbial activity Braissant et al 2003 Spadafora et al 2010 have submicrometric dimensions differing significantly from those found in the pre salt rocks Formation and Evolution of Fascicular Calcite Crusts Fascicular calcite crusts are interpreted as syngenetic or synsedimentary precipitates encrusting many different deposits The absence of clotted and cryptocrystalline textures as well as of irregular branching structures characteristic of the mineralization of benthic microbial communities cf Burne and Moore 1987 Riding 2000 and the continuous fibrous crystal fabric of the fascicular crusts indicate that they are not microbialites sensu Burne and Moore 1987 but rather a product of abiotic precipitation A chemical abiotic precipitation has been interpreted for texturally equivalent deposits in travertines cf Chafetz and Guidry 1999 Fouke 2011 stromatolites cf Grotzinger and Knoll 1995 1999 Riding 2008 Pope et al 2000 alkaline saline lakes cf Jones and Renaut 1994 Warren 2006 and more recently for the pre salt reservoirs themselves Wright and Barnett 2015 Additionally the absence of luminescence of the fascicular calcite suggests a low content of organic matter inclusions in the aggregates The fascicular calcite aggregates precipitated not only

1304 JSR R HERLINGER JR ET AL encrusting diverse sediments particularly the background stevensitic deposits but also partially replacing them This is indicated by the common occurrence of clay laminations peloids and other particles in the interstitial spaces and as inclusions in the aggregates The truncation of clay laminations by fascicular calcite aggregates is common indicating that they grew as early diagenetic replacement The combined evidence indicates that the precipitation of syngenetic calcite crusts and of stevensite was chemically controlled by the dynamic evolution of the lacustrine environmental conditions Stevensite precipitated under high concentrations of silica and magnesium and low pCO2 while calcite precipitation was favored by less concentrated fluids related to less arid periods and or by degassing after pCO2 input from magmatic and or hydrothermal activity The paragenetic relationships of calcite crusts with stevensite and the main evolution pathways are illustrated in Figure 14 Where calcite precipitation predominated the development of coalesced fascicular shrubs formed interstitial growth framework porosity with variable amounts of trapped clastic and stevensitic particles The dissolution of stevensite released magnesium and silica which resulted in replacement of calcite shrubs by silica and dolomite cement partially or totally filling the growthframework porosity In other cases the growth framework pores were enlarged by dissolution of the fascicular aggregates Where calcite precipitation was less extensive discontinuous non coalesced calcite crusts were formed intercalated laterally and vertically by stevensite Stevensite deposits were heterogeneously replaced by calcite spherulites and by dolomite The dissolution of stevensite among spherulites locally generated porosity but seldom reservoirs as dolomite commonly cemented the secondary porosity generated by stevensite dissolution Diagenesis of the Intraclastic Grainstones and Rudstones Two main patterns of eogenetic evolution defined by the relationship between compaction and cementation were recognized in the intraclastic grainstones and rudstones formed by fragmentation of the calcite crusts and reworking of spherulites and stevensitic particles Fig 15 1 Rocks with limited eogenetic cementation were affected by mechanical and chemical compaction followed by mesogenetic calcite cementation Fig 10C 2 Partial heterogeneous eogenetic cementation by calcite or dolomite promoted the preservation of interparticle primary porosity inhibiting pressure dissolution The porosity was heterogeneously enlarged by dissolution of the intraclasts Fig 10D Some samples display abundant eogenetic precipitation of displacive silica which filled the porosity and inhibited the mesogenetic processes Clay rich packstones formed by intraclasts and clay matrix Fig 10B locally show early dissolution of the matrix enabling a diagenetic evolution similar to that observed in the grainstones and rudstones Fig 15 Figure 12 shows the paragenesis of the intraclastic grainstones and rudstones Dolomite Dolomite occurs very frequently in the studied pre salt rocks especially in the sag section with various morphologies and timings At least five major phases of dolomite precipitation were identified Early dolomite grew inside unconsolidated stevensite laminae visibly displacing the sediment Fig 6E A microbial origin for these early dolomites is unlikely since the mechanism of dolomite precipitation by sulfate reducing bacteria proposed by McKenzie and Vasconcelos 2009 would not be effective in lacustrine environments with low sulfate as evidenced by the absence of pyrite framboids or of primary and or eogenetic sulfates The formation of early dolomite was probably directly related to the dissolution of stevensite although it may have been favored also by the dehydration of magnesium complexes promoted by the carboxylated surfaces of the organic matter present in the stevensite Roberts et al 2013 A second type of dolomite occurrence corresponds to a mimetic replacement of stevensite laminations Fig 7B which is normally not associated with porosity generation A third type of dolomite occurs as pore filling on sag deposits cementing calcite crusts and intraclastic rocks Pre compaction dolomite cementation on intraclastic grainstones and rudstones suggests an early eogenetic origin for dolomite pore filling A fourth pattern of dolomitization corresponds to the pervasive replacement of the rock Fig 4A common in both the rift bioclastic rocks and in the deposits of the sag stage This dolomitization pattern frequently occurs associated with silicification and fracturing and with the generation of porosity which may be related to circulation of hydrothermal fluids The fifth type corresponds to the saddle dolomite Fig 11C which occurs frequently associated with fracturing Saddle dolomite is a common mesogenetic constituent in carbonate and clastic rocks Spo tl and Pitman 1998 and is not by itself indicative of hydrothermal alteration However its association with intense fracturing in some of the studied rocks suggests hydrothermal influence Hydrothermal and Mesogenetic Alterations The term hydrothermal has been defined in different ways generally to characterize changes related to hot water circulation Machel 2002 suggests that the term should be used only to identify minerals that are formed at temperatures higher than those of the host rocks regardless of the origin and composition of the fluids In this sense the identification of hydrothermal alteration would require isotopic and fluid inclusion analyses or the presence of exotic mineralogy formed at high temperatures The presence of saddle dolomite does not define hydrothermal alteration since it can be formed at common burial temperatures and conditions as previously discussed However there are occurrences in the studied succession that are characterized by intense fracturing dissolution silicification dolomitization as well as concentration of barite fluorite kaolinite or dickite pyrite and other sulfides These alterations could be promoted by the focused circulation of deep sourced fluids which generated distinct hydrothermal alterations Recently Alvarenga et al 2016 recognized multiple hydrothermal vents in the rift section of central Campos Basin Although lacking sampling of the most affected intervals areas with intense dissolution were interpreted in the well logs and formation tests as probably related to hypogenic hydrothermal karst cf Dublyansky 1995 Heward et al 2000 Such areas may be extremely important for fluid flow and hydrocarbon production Mesogenetic dissolution has not created a significant volume of porosity in the studied reservoirs Vuggy porosity occurs erratically along the studied reservoirs in several facies These vugs are interpreted to have been formed during mesodiagenesis by dissolution of primary and eogenetic constituents since typical eogenetic cements are not observed filling these pore types Such dissolution may have been generated by acidic pore waters derived from the rift shales Racey et al 2001 Beavington Penney et al 2008 Although exotic minerals such as epidotes prehnite amphiboles and metallic sulfides were not observed in channel and vugular porosity the influence of hydrothermal fluids on mesogenetic dissolution at pore scale cannot be ruled out Celestine barite and anhydrite occasionally occur as late cements filling primary and secondary porosity and or replacing primary and diagenetic constituents As these minerals are commonly related to fractured intervals their precipitation was probably connected with the circulation of deep fluids although they could be locally influenced by the dissolution of overlying evaporites The occurrence of aluminum phosphate sulfate APS minerals is not indicative of any specific genetic environment occurring in a wide diversity of geological settings including sedimentary carbonates and siliciclastics igneous and metamorphic rocks Dill 2001 Traces of svanbergite goyazite occur replacing mud intraclasts in the bioclastic reservoirs and are associated with silicification dolomitization and fracturing in other facies in sag deposits Specific geochemical

JSR LACUSTRINE PRE SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS FROM NORTHERN CAMPOS BASIN analyses are necessary for a better understanding of origin and timing of these minerals Porosity and Permeability of Reservoir Petrofacies Reservoir petrofacies were defined for the studied lithologies based on the main primary structures textures and constituents major diagenetic processes and products and patterns of relationship between these parameters with porosity and permeability Bivalve Gastropod Rudstones with Interparticle Porosity Preservation of interparticle porosity occurred mostly where neomorphism predominated over dissolution Figs 3D 4D This petrofacies has the best permeability among the bioclastic reservoirs even considering samples with lower porosity Fig 16A Table 1 Partially preserved primary porosity mildly reduced by mechanical compaction and minor cementation is connected by large pore throats MICP analyses indicate that the pore throats are significantly larger than in other petrofacies Fig 17A In some cases however continued cementation has narrowed the pore throats decreasing permeability Subordinate moldic pores increased the porosity but with little effect on permeability Nevertheless the local development of vugular pores has enlarged the primary pores enhancing permeability Bivalve Gastropod Rudstones with Moldic Porosity Bioclastic rocks with predominantly moldic or intraparticle porosity combined with some interparticle porosity are common These rocks have good porosity but low permeability Table 1 Fig 16A The cementation of the moldic and intraparticle pores is common occasionally totally occluding the secondary porosity The remaining interparticle pores contribute to the permeability but because pore throats are controlled by microcrystalline and intercrystalline pores Fig 17A permeabilities are generally low Locally vugular porosity was formed by enlargement and connection of molds increasing pore throats and generating fair permeability conditions Bivalve Gastropod Rudstones with Vugular Porosity Vugular porosity is often scarce in the studied rocks Fig 4E Where vugs are the predominant pore type porosities and permeabilities are generally low Table 1 Fig 16A due to the low connectivity of the pore system The presence of remnants of interparticle porosity contributes to some permeability though generally low However because core samples with high vugular porosity were poorly recovered and not suitable for petrophysical analyses it is possible that the amount of vugular porosity was underestimated in the reservoirs due to these sampling limitations Bivalve Gastropod Grainstones with Moldic Porosity These grainstones have a high content of moldic porosity and a total porosity higher than all the bioclastic petrofacies Table 1 Fig 16A These rocks generally present remaining interparticle porosity which gives them some permeability Vugular porosity was generated from enlargement of moldic porosity producing widened pore throats which increases permeability The grainstones often present recrystallization which has generated intercrystalline porosity but with narrow pore throats Fig 17B and low permeability Stevensitic Arenites The high instability of Mg clays cf Tosca and Wright 2014 has favored the dissolution of ooids and the precipitation of silica and dolomite Fig 5 redistributing the original porosity The pore system of stevensitic arenites is extremely heterogeneous generally presenting high porosities and highly variable permeabilities Table 1 Fig 16E The dissolution of ooids resulting in moldic and intraparticle porosity was important generating a significant increase in porosity Microporosity in authigenic silica is observed Remnants of primary 1307 interparticle porosity are occasionally preserved although the original interstitial porosity of most of the samples was completely filled by dolomite and quartz Dolomitization has generated abundant intercrystalline porosity occasionally connecting moldic and intracrystalline pores and supplying permeability to the stevensitic arenites Coalescent Calcite Crusts Coalescent calcite crusts are composed of well developed shrubs of fascicular calcite aggregates which coalesced vertically and or horizontally Fig 8A The growth of these precipitates generated a growth framework primary pore system with moderate porosity and good permeability controlled by large pore throats Table 1 Fig 16B Rezende and Pope 2015 properly related aspects of the depositional texture including shrub size sorting and packing to the porosity and permeability of analogous calcite crust reservoirs from the Santos Basin According to those authors the size of individual shrubs exerts a primary control on pore size affecting both porosity and permeability Although depositional texture probably exerted a major control on the primary petrophysical properties of the crusts their primary fabric was strongly modified during diagenesis by cementation and or dissolution The dissolution of stevensite laminae or peloids filling interstices among the fascicular aggregates or in adjacent layers favored the precipitation of dolomite partially or totally cementing the interstitial porosity which represented the main reducer of primary porosity Commonly coalescent crusts present porosity enhancement through partial dissolution of shrubs and cements Fig 8A which has increased their porosity and has led to an enlargement of pore throats with a consequent increase of permeability Fig 17D Intracrystalline porosity related to dissolution of dolomite crystals Fig 9B C or shrubs is very common Porosity is present even in rocks without petrographic porosity due to intracrystalline porosity generated from dissolution of shrubs as observed in SEM analyses Fig 9E Non Coalescent Calcite Crusts Poorly developed calcite crusts with non coalescent shrubs of fascicular calcite display interstices occupied by stevensite laminae and peloids or even by siliciclastic matrix resulting in limited growth framework primary porosity Fig 14 Consequently these rocks show low primary porosity and permeability Commonly associated stevensite laminae and peloids were partially replaced mainly by calcite spherulites and dolomite crystals Later dissolution has generated intercrystalline porosity Fig 7E The dominance of discontinuous intercrystalline porosity plus minor growth framework porosity has generated poor reservoirs with mostly narrow pore throats Figs 16B 17E Most non coalescent crusts have low porosity and permeability Even though these reservoirs present poor quality Table 2 they can store oil and probably contribute to the production of the wells Intraclastic Grainstones and Rudstones Few intraclastic rocks exhibit good reservoir quality owing to partially preserved primary porosity representing good quality reservoirs Table 2 Fig 16D At least part of the intraclastic grainstones and rudstones composed of reworked calcite crusts and spherulites had good primary interparticle porosity which was destroyed by compaction and cementation Fig 10C Heterogeneous cementation preserved part of the primary porosity which was enhanced by particle dissolution while the porosity of uncemented rocks was completely obliterated during mesodiagenesis by interparticle pressure dissolution and calcite cementation Fig 15 No clear particle size control is observed on porosity and permeability suggesting that diagenesis is the major control Secondary intraparticle porosity in partly dissolved intraclasts is occasionally seen in rocks with some preserved interparticle porosity Fig 10D When moldic or vugular porosity occur associated with interparticle porosity permeability is higher generating the best reservoir conditions among the intraclastic rocks

permeability in studied reservoir petrofacies A pore type of bioclastic bivalve gastropod rudstones and grainstones ranges between totally moldic to interparticle The interpretive axis Interparticle Porosity represents 100 of interparticle pores which may be preserved or reduced by compaction and cementation The other extreme axis would represent 100 moldic porosity which increases by dissolution of bioclasts or decreases by cementation of molds In addition intercrystalline porosity often generated by dolomitization increases both total porosity and permeability Samples show the association of more than one type of pore ranging between the interpreted axes B Coalescent calcite crusts have primary growthframework porosity that can be reduced by cementation or preserved and increased by pore enlargement Alternatively the interstices may have been early filled by stevensite which may have been preserved or dissolved Porosity of non coalescent crusts is related to the dissolution of stevensite generating intercrystalline porosity among dolomite crystals and spherulites Abundant intracrystalline dissolution is observed within calcite crusts and dolomite cements which generates some porosity with minor effect on permeability C Dolostones have a well defined trend of porosity and permeability controlled by the amount of intercrystalline porosity D Intraclastic rudstones and grainstones are intensely affected by compaction and cementation Partial preservation of interparticle porosity promotes preservation of permeability both porosity and permeability may be increased by particle dissolution E Stevensitic arenites pore types range between moldic þ microcrystalline porosity related to silicification low permeability and moldic þ intercrystalline porosity related to dolomitization high permeability Clay Rich Packstones Intraclastic rocks with clay matrix are usually not reservoirs In some cases however early dissolution of matrix occurred leaving residual dolomite and or silica Some of such petrofacies evolved similarly to grainstones with secondary porosity partially preserved by heterogeneous cementation Fig 15 Another possibility for the occurrence of secondary porosity in clay rich packstones is through early heterogeneous dolomitization or silicification followed by dissolution Dolostones Dolomitization is a very important process generating rocks with the best porosity and permeability of the studied reservoirs Table 1 Fig 16C In many cases sucrosic dolomitization has added intercrystalline porosity leaving relicts of primary interparticle or moldic and or vugular secondary porosity Dolomitized rudstones with moldic and or vugular porosity have developed higher porosities and permeabilities after dolomitization through the connection of vugs and molds by intercrystalline porosity which have controlled pore throat diameters Fig 17C However the vugular porosity can be directly related to dolomitization processes Late processes were limited to the precipitation of minor amounts of saddle dolomite preserving most of the intercrystalline porosity generated during dolomitization The frequent total dolomitization of sag rocks generated significant decrease of pore throat size Fig 17F Apparently early dolomitization caused severe porosity reduction while dolomitization associated with fracturing has generated higher porosities and permeabilities 1999 Claes et al 2017 Travertines however exhibit steep facies diversity and distribution restricted to the immediate proximity of their source springs These features are not observed in the pre salt calcite crusts indicating that these carbonates were precipitated in subaqueous environments Continuous subsidence during the sag stage with a constant supply of magnesium calcium and silica allowed the accumulation of more than 200 meters of precipitated carbonates and clays which allowed the development of reservoirs with impressive thicknesses The geometry of the fascicular calcite crusts inhibited the compaction of the reservoirs preserving good permeability associated with large pores and wide pore throats The dissolution of stevensite after the precipitation of spherulites and dolomite developed significant secondary porosity in originally argillaceous deposits Tosca and Wright 2015 The distribution of calcite stevensite and porosity in the sag section follows complex patterns which were fundamentally controlled not by lacustrine base level but by the chemistry of the lake waters Wright and Barnett 2015 These observations have significant implications for the construction of predictive and conceptual models for the exploration of the sag pre salt reservoirs in the Campos and Santos basins and for planning the development and optimizing oil recovery from the producing oilfields CONCLUSIONS 1 Implications for Exploration of Lacustrine Carbonates The absence of features characteristic of vadose diagenesis i e pendular or meniscus cements geopetal features etc and of exposure surfaces in massive bioclastic reservoirs about 100 meters thick suggests that they were accumulated in relatively deep lacustrine environments The extensive resedimentation of the bioclastic deposits by gravitational mass movements was probably triggered by tectonism as also observed in the central area of the basin Goldberg et al 2017 These factors allowed the accumulation of thick bioclastic deposits which were probably remobilized from shoreface and related shallow water environments The limited fragmentation and abrasion of bivalve shells suggests little reworking and short residence time in moderate energy shallow environments before redeposition The good preservation of the bioclasts contributes to the common occurrence of reservoirs with good permeability owing to large pores connected by wide pore throats Redeposition to deep lacustrine settings allowed impressive accumulation of the bioclastic deposits and inhibited extensive dissolution of the bioclasts and interparticle cementation Thus bioclastic deposits redeposited in relatively deep lacustrine settings may constitute attractive exploratory targets in other areas of the Campos Basin and in other rift basins with similar geologic context The crusts of fascicular optic calcite present significant similarity with crystalline shrub facies and pore types of travertines Chafetz and Guidry 2 3 4 A study integrating systematic petrographic characterization and petrophysical analysis reveals that the pre salt lacustrine reservoirs of northern Campos Basin have complex pore systems which result in highly heterogeneous permeability patterns The primary composition and porosity have a strong influence on the evolution quality of the reservoirs The compositional and porosity evolution of the bioclastic rudstone and grainstone rift reservoirs is controlled by the balance between dissolution and neomorphism of the aragonitic bivalves and gastropods When the circulation and geochemistry of eogenetic interstitial fluids favored the dissolution of aragonite and precipitation of low magnesium calcite moldic porosity was generated and primary interparticle porosity was reduced resulting in low permeability The predominance of neomorphism over dissolution resulted in higher permeability due to the preservation of primary interparticle porosity The redeposition of the bioclasts into relatively deep lacustrine settings is a crucial factor for the accumulation of thick deposits with partially preserved interparticle porosity which constitute good quality reservoirs Sag stage stevensitic deposits were replaced mainly by calcite spherulites and dolomite These rocks locally constitute reservoirs where secondary porosity was generated by stevensite dissolution Dissolution of stevensite provided magnesium and silica favoring the dolomitization and silicification commonly observed in the studied succession

and grain type are not considered in the flow unit classification This is the main problem with the FZI technique and flow units rock typing because due to the lack of cor relation with the local geology is extremely difficult to propagate the flow units in a sedimentary based geological model Furthermore obtaining seismic attributes correlations to use as constraints to geo statistical procedures is often incipient due to the scale difference be tween the core and seismic data We calculated the stratigraphic modified Lorenz plot SMLP Gunter et al 1997 using the storage capacity and flow capacity of both Barra Velha and Itapema formations from the core laboratory permeability and porosity measurements Fig 3 In Gunter et al 1997 proposed that the interpretation of each FU is performed observing the slope of the curve flat segments corresponds to seals or baffle zones as they may present some level of porosity but have no contribution of permeability Steep segments correspond to speed zones of the reservoir they can have low or high porosity but provide major contributions to the reservoir flow performance in terms of fluid movement In this study we did not used the SMLP to address any discretization in terms of FU We did use as a graphic tool to indicate how FUs will present at different scales This is a concept like sequence stratigraphy studies where higher and lower orders of cyclicity can be individualized using the Wheeler Diagram Wheeler 1958 for example as a graphic tool We can measure different scales in the SMLP plot Higher and lower orders of slope variations are present expressed by the green higher order and black lower order lines in Fig 3 We see clearly that vari ations of the low and high frequency are correlational since the slope of the low frequency curve depends on the constructive effect of each high frequency curve Considering the study s objectives of characterize decametre flow units using the seismic data as constraints as discussed in the Seismic Scale section we considered as a starting point for our analysis the number of four FU which corresponds to the lower order of slope variation in Fig 3 black lines We found the same high and low frequency variations in the depth versus accumulated normalized FZI plot as suggested by Da Rocha et al 2019 We choose the RQI FZI method for rock typing into flow units for the study area because of the large number of core permeability and porosity measurements Due to the high geological heterogeneity of the Mero reservoir a conventional analysis of RQI FZI produces a large number of FUs as evidenced by the small scale variation in Fig 3 Given the scale differences between the core and well log data and the seismic data we prefer to discretize the RQI FZI rock typing using percentiles values and a cumulative S curve of core permeability porosity data and then analyze the slope variation of this plot The steps to construct the RQI FZI curve are 1 Calculate porosity and permeability percentiles of the core dataset 2 Calculate RQI and FZI values using Eq 1 Eq 2 and the percen tiles values 3 Order the data with increasing values of log FZI 4 Accumulate and normalize the percentiles of permeability values 7

S Pedrinha and V M Artagão Barnett 2015 also suggested that these deposits have a dominantly lacustrine origin This interpretation according to the authors is based on an extensive analysis of cores and thin sections where they found 1 scarce fossiliferous content with the presence of non marine ostracods and phosphatic fragments 2 the absence of marine fossils including those typical of a restricted marine environment such as miliolid foraminifera 3 an abundant presence of magnesian clay minerals common in alkaline lakes under the inﬂuence of volcanic terrains and 4 the absence of sulfates such as anhydrite or gypsum that would be expected in a restricted environment under a marine inﬂuence Other works such as those by Saller et al 2016 Herlinger 2016 and Ceraldi and Green 2017 analysed the rocks of the sag section of the Kwanza and Campos basins which are chronologically correlated with the deposits of the Barra Velha Formation The lithotypes identiﬁed there are very similar to those described by Wright and Barnett 2015 which also supports the interpretation of these deposits as having been dominantly accumulated in a lacustrine setting The rock samples studied in the present work have similar characteristics to those cited by the authors mentioned above which supports a lacustrine interpretation for the Barra Velha Formation deposits Therefore lake dynamics had a strong inﬂuence on the deposition of these rocks Compared to marine environments lakes are systems with lower volumes of water and consequently are much more sensitive to climate Bohacs et al 2000 Wet and dry periods directly inﬂuence a lake s level sedimentation rate and the available space for sediment accumulation i e accommodation Fig 3 When the precipitation rates exceed the evaporation rates in wet periods the volume of water brought in by rivers increases which is directly proportional to the external inﬂux of sediments the water volume that raises the lake level is responsible for an increase in accommodation and the expansion of its margins When evaporation rates exceed precipitation rates in dry periods external sediment input decreases as rivers become less vigorous or even dry During these periods the lake tends to retract exposing previously subaqueous areas and its water depth tends to decrease restricting accommodation Owing to the decrease in the lake s water volume dry periods promote an increase in alkalinity and salinity and develop chemical and biogenic carbonate facies Facies analysis The Tupi Field currently has more than 100 drilled wells Fig 1 making it the largest reservoir Fig 3 Main lacustrine sedimentation variables and controls over a full climatic cycle There is a direct link between external sedimentary supply rainfall water alkalinity carbonate production and evaporation Extra basinal interference on groundwater ﬂuctuation e g eustasy is not considered in this diagram Source modiﬁed from Bento Freire 2012 and Pedrinha 2014

The giant Tupi Field high resolution stratigraphy associated with detrital siliciclastic components Fig 5 Facies components discussion The observed calcitic shrubs in this study are like those classiﬁed by Chafetz and Guidry 1999 as ray crystal shrubs and interpreted as being a product of abiotic processes The authors associate these elements with high rates of CO2 loss and high saturation environments providing very high rates of calcium carbonate precipitation Moreira et al 2007 interpreted these constituents as being a product of biological activity and related calcitic shrubs to microbial stromatolite deposition The occurrence of calcitic spherulites is observed in several recent carbonate environments Buczynski and Chafetz 1993 Verrecchia et al 1995 Spadafora et al 2010 Bahniuk et al 2015 However their origin has been widely debated over recent years Dupraz et al 2009 emphasized the role of organic matrices in calcium carbonate mineralization controlling the crystals morphology and their mineralogy According to the authors biological processes inﬂuence the calcitic spherulite genesis where metabolic activity of bacteria creates a favourable environment for precipitation The results from Tutulo and Tosca s 2018 studies also provided a robust constraint on the geochemistry of Mg silicate carbonate interactions during alkaline lake sedimentation leaving open the potential for biological contributions to sedimentation within the pre salt basins Mercedes Martín et al 2016 through experimental analysis have demonstrated that in saline and alkaline solutions containing organic acids which are common in microbial mats calcitic spherulites can precipitate However the observed particle size c 0 02 mm is signiﬁcantly smaller than similar components observed in our study Mercedes Martín et al 2016 also observed that supersaturated solutions do not precipitate spherulitic calcium carbonate forms The growth of spherulites is favoured by a higher concentration of magnesium and silica in very alkaline solutions associated with increased rates of calcite crystallization with or without microbial inﬂuence and especially in a viscous media Garcia Ruiz 2000 Sanchez Navas et al 2009 Beck and Andreassen 2010 Meister et al 2011 Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 proposed an abiotic precipitation mechanism for the calcitic spherulites observed in the Barra Velha Formation Hydrated gels rich in silica and magnesium as mentioned by Tosca and Masterson 2014 as possible precursors of magnesian clay aggregates would be an ideal realm for the nucleation and growth of these components The transition types between calcitic spherulites and calcitic shrubs indicates a continuous process for generating these components Saller et al 2016 reported the occurrence of hybrid components between spherulites and shrubs in the Aptian section of the Kwanza Basin which is very similar to those observed in our study Saller et al 2016 interpreted the spherulites as developing inside muddy sediments in low energy environments while the shrubs precipitate in higher energy and supersaturated environments The hybrid forms are associated with transitional environments between these two physicochemical conditions Several authors report syngenetic magnesian clay minerals in alkaline and saline lacustrine environments Millot 1970 Darragi and Tardy 1987 Calvo et al 1999 Clay minerals can occur in the form of stevensite sepiolite palygorskite saponite kerolite and talc Darragi and Tardy 1987 Carramal et al 2022 depending on the chemical conditions of the lake water Herlinger s 2016 analysis of the Macabu Formation deposits Campos Basin which are chronologically equivalent to the Barra Velha Formation suggests a predominantly stevensitic composition for the observed clays Tosca and Masterson 2014 observed that the occurrence of a gel and not a crystalline structured clay mineral is associated with the initial stages of stevensite precipitation Such evidence is relevant to understanding this gel s potential to nucleate minerals and therefore to interpreting magnesian clay distribution in lacustrine deposits These gels are unlikely to stay preserved in high energy environments under the inﬂuence of waves currents or regions susceptible to subaerial exposure Tosca and Wright 2018 Sedimentary facies Six facies

siliciclastic content RC si Laminated mudstones Laminated mudstones LM are characterized on a macroscopic scale by a millimetric alternation of light coloured layers and brownish to greenish layers The light coloured layers are silt to clay in grain size and carbonate calcitic and dolomitic in composition In contrast the brownish to greenish layers are organic rich and associated with silt to clay detrital siliciclastic constituents The observed

S Pedrinha and V M Artagão laminations are crenulated or ﬂat the former being much more common One of the most singular aspects of these facies is the common presence of silica occurring in centimetric to decimetric layers Fig 7 At a microscopic scale carbonate layers may exhibit an irregular and discontinuous appearance and are commonly recrystallized Silt sized detrital siliciclastic constituents typically occur Locally concentrated levels of phosphatic bioclast fragments and dispersed ostracods compose the fossiliferous content Fig 8 Clay intervals have different proportions of silt and very ﬁne sand composed of quartz micas feldspars and opaque and greenish minerals When the proportion of detrital siliciclastic material is high these layers become greenish and magnesian clays generally occur Spherulitic claystones Spherulitic claystones SC are characterized on a macroscopic scale by magnesian clay aggregates that commonly occur associated with calcitic spherulites A brownish to greenish colour is the most frequent with a large variation in the proportion of spherulites to clay matrix forming a wackestone like texture when spherulite levels are concentrated causing amalgamation The proportion of spherulites typically increases towards the top of the layers resulting in a laminated appearance to the rock due to the alternating proportions Fig 9 It is possible to see that the spherulites displace and deform the magnesian clay aggregates at a microscopic scale The clays are often dolomitized and commonly associated with detrital siliciclastic mud content Fig 5 The characteristics observed in the spherulitic claystones are similar to those reported in the study on magnesium silicates in the Tupi Field conducted by Carramal et al 2022 In situ carbonates with well developed shrub like texture The InSitu shrubs facies association is deﬁned by the presence of vertical to subvertical growth of welldeveloped shrub like elements 2 mm which eventually exhibit a primary texture modiﬁed by a subaerial exposure process resulting in dissolved and brecciated intervals Fig 10 Levels of different sizes of shrubs give a laminated aspect at the Fig 7 a c Laminated calcitic and dolomitic mudstones LM facies appearance Greenish colours are associated with detrital siliciclastic constituents d Laminae silica levels dark grey

S Pedrinha and V M Artagão Fig 11 a b Incipient calcitic shrubs amalgamate laterally and form crust horizons yellow arrow Calcitic spherulitic constituents are also commonly observed in the InSitu incip facies of the RC and RC si facies are interpreted as being a product of subaqueous tractive ﬂow in a high tomoderate energy environment associated with the action of currents and waves Palaeoenvironmental interpretation Lithofacies analysis supports a model for the occurrence of facies in the Tupi Field area that considers the relationships between parameters like water depth energy levels and distance to the local lake margin Fig 14 However lake level ﬂuctuations acted as a control on these parameters variability through space and time giving origin to a complex lateral and vertical shift in facies and hiatuses in the geological record LM and SC facies developed in a low energy environment with relatively deeper water depths Higher allogenic ﬁne grained detrital siliciclastic content and the presence of tabular silica levels interpreted as syngenetic and associated with a decrease in the lake water pH suggest that the LM facies can be correlated with a wet climate Spherulitic claystones and their associated syngenetic magnesian clays and calcitic spherulites suggest a relatively higher pH alkaline and higher ion concentration in the lake water Tosca and Wright 2018 However the common presence of detrital siliciclastic constituents indicates deposition under a moderately wet climate with consequently an external input of sediments into the system InSitu shrubs developed under high tomoderate energy environments located in shallower water depths Dry periods and CO2 degassing related to water agitation favoured the ideal chemical conditions that induced the precipitation of fascicular forms of calcium carbonate directly on the lake substrate The intermediate physicochemical conditions between SC and InSitu shrubs triggered the accumulation of InSitu incip facies Extremely reduced water depths which prevented the more effective growth of the fascicular forms can also explain incipient carbonate facies The presence of sedimentary structures related to bedload transport and the composition of the RC and RC si constituents indicate high to moderate energy conditions associated with the action of waves and currents in shallow water depths The trigger for the genesis of these deposits occurs during wet periods when the water inﬂux promoted the input of sediments into the system especially near the lake margin where particles generated by subaerial exposure were available Sandy to conglomeratic detrital siliciclastic constituents composed predominantly of igneous clasts indicate the existence of emerged areas with volcanic deposits associated with intrabasinal structural highs inherited from rift tectonism Thick and extensive deposits of reworked carbonates are observed in the Tupi Field particularly in the structurally higher regions This occurs because the shorelines of lakes are relatively narrower compared to marine environments due to limited wave action fetch that creates a shallow wave base This effect is ampliﬁed in low gradient lakes where rapid ﬂuctuations in lake levels prevent the establishment of a stable shoreline Barnett et al 2018 The preservation of the magnesian clays is mainly controlled by environmental depositional energy As

The giant Tupi Field high resolution stratigraphy High resolution sequence stratigraphy Sequence stratigraphy has a fundamental criterion the analysis of changes in sedimentary facies stacking patterns caused by variations in accommodation and sediment supply rates over time These changes give rise to stratigraphic surfaces that mark important modiﬁcations in the sedimentation regime which are relevant for stratigraphic correlation and understanding the sedimentary evolution in a given area Catuneanu 2006 Nowadays a consensus is that a sequence the fundamental sequence stratigraphy unit can be limited by any two stratigraphic surfaces both having the same genesis thus bounding a complete sedimentary cycle In this way a succession of strata deposited during a full cycle of accommodation or sedimentary supply variation deﬁnes a sequence Such deﬁnition is generic independent of models and encompasses all types of sequences that can develop at any spatial or temporal scale Catuneanu et al 2011 More pragmatically considering elements observed in the geological record a sequence could also be conceived of as a succession of strata that presents a complete cycle of facies stacking pattern variation being limited by stratigraphic surfaces Catuneanu and Zecchin 2013 The concept of a sequence is particularly reinforced when its areal mappability can be demonstrated and the repeatability of its stacking patterns in the vertical section can be veriﬁed Fragoso et al 2021 The analysis of the facies stacking patterns observed in the Barra Velha Formation in the Tupi Field allows the recognition of sequences at different scales The different sequence scales identiﬁed do not have at ﬁrst any absolute temporal connotation embedded in their deﬁnitions corresponding only to stacking pattern variations with different vertical extents However the changes in environmental conditions responsible for sequence discretization occurred at different scales of time and space Elementary sequences A facies succession corresponding to the smallest recognizable cycle of environmental change characterizes an elementary sequence Strasser et al 1999 Based on the interpretation of the processes related to the main identiﬁed sedimentary facies and their stacking pattern analysis three main elementary sequence types are deﬁned Type 1 Type 2 and Type 3 elementary sequences Fig 15 The Type 1 elementary sequence is organized in the vertical from base to top as follows thick packages of reworked carbonates with siliciclastic content RC si in situ carbonates with incipient shrub like and or crust like texture InSitu incip and in situ carbonates with well developed shrublike texture InSitu shrubs These sequences commonly present features of subaerial exposure at the top and in terms of dimensions commonly have decimetric and rarely metric thicknesses The observed vertical facies succession for the Type 2 elementary sequence is from base to top as follows packages of reworked carbonates RC laminated mudstones LM spherulitic claystones SC in situ carbonates with incipient shrub like and or crust like texture InSitu incip and in situ carbonates with well developed shrub like texture InSitu shrubs Type 2 elementary sequences commonly present subaerial exposure features at the top and have a thickness of decimetric and rarely metric dimensions The Type 3 elementary sequence presents a vertical facies arrangement from base to top as follows thin packages of reworked carbonates RC laminated mudstones LM spherulitic claystones SC and in situ carbonates with incipient shrub like and or crust like texture InSitu incip Subordinately in situ carbonates with well developed shrub like texture InSitu shrubs are observed punctuating the top of these sequences A relevant characteristic of this sequence is the abundant presence of subaerial exposure features with the development of dissolution and brecciation that especially affects the InSitu incip and InSitu shrubs facies The observed thickness dimensions of the Type 3 elementary sequence are commonly decimetric and rarely metric High resolution sequence stratigraphy discussion The identiﬁed elementary sequence facies successions can be interpreted in terms of a complete lakelevel variation curve representing the highest frequency cycle of environmental variation identiﬁed in the Tupi Field area Fig 15 Lacustrine sedimentary dynamics were the control mechanisms for forming the elementary sequences and consequently it is possible to identify two sedimentation regimes in its geological record Precipitation rates exceeding evaporation rates initiated the wet sedimentation regime that gradually increased accommodation and promoted the lake s areal expansion The rainfall water inﬂux and its associated sediments progressively reduced water alkalinity and salinity decreasing carbonate precipitation rates This regime was prone to the deposition of reworked constituents which were transported into the lake by rainfall water and low energy facies due to the increased water depth Evaporation rates exceeding precipitation rates established the dry sedimentation regime and promoted the lake s retraction The progressive water volume reduction increased the lake alkalinity and salinity favouring the precipitation of in situ facies since its components especially

S Pedrinha and V M Artagão Fig 15 Elementary sequence representations for Barra Velha Formation deposits in the Tupi Field Due to the short period involved in their deposition subsidence is considered constant the well developed shrubs have a predominantly chemical genesis The lake level fall linked to high evaporation and carbonate precipitation rates was responsible for the progressive reduction in accommodation and the lake s retraction in the dry sedimentation regime leading to the generation of subaerial exposure features The presence of the RC si facies and the absence of low energy facies LM and SC facies during the wet sedimentation regime characterize the Type 1 elementary sequence These aspects suggest high to moderate energy conditions throughout the whole development of this sequence even in high lake level periods It means that high frequency

The giant Tupi Field high resolution stratigraphy lake level variations could not signiﬁcantly shift the lake margin maintaining constant and elevated energy conditions over time at the basin s analysed position The presence of igneous constituents implies the existence of exposed intrabasinal volcanic structural highs and in addition to the small lateral variation of the water body margin points to a lake with a complex palaeotopography with a relatively higher relief The substantial development of InSitu shrubs facies characterizes the Type 2 elementary sequence indicating deposition in waters with relatively higher alkalinity and ionic concentration The commonly observed presence of LM and SC facies in the wet sedimentation regime indicates a low energy environment during the lake expansion periods Highfrequency lake level variations combined with a lower relief lake palaeotopography allowed signiﬁcant lateral shifts of the lake margin effectively changing from lower to higher energy conditions over short periods The occurrence of low energy facies mostly laminated mudstones associated with lake expansion periods and the common presence of subaerial exposure features usually affecting the InSitu shrubs or InSitu incip facies during lake retraction comprise the main aspects of the Type 3 elementary sequence This alternation low energy facies during expansion and extensive subaerial exposure features during retraction suggests another conﬁguration in the lake s topographic condition Very low relief basin physiography allowed high frequency lakelevel variations to signiﬁcantly shift its margin drastically changing the lake s areal extent and the regions on which sedimentary processes acted during wet and dry periods The lower relative proportion of InSitu shrubs facies may also indicate a more diluted water body with lower alkalinity than the other sequences From the sequence stratigraphy perspective two essential surfaces can be identiﬁed within an elementary sequence and related to a lake level variation curve The maximum expansion surface MES marks the moment when the distance between the centre of the lake and its margin reaches its maximum The MES also represents the moment when the sedimentation rate starts to exceed accommodation From this point on the facies stacking pattern changes showing a shallowing upward pattern This modiﬁcation marks the beginning of lake retraction and a progressive water depth reduction characterizing the retracting lake regime facies tract RLRT The second stratigraphic surface identiﬁed is the maximum retraction surface MRS This surface expresses the moment when the distance between the centre of the lake and its margin reaches its minimum The MRS also records the moment when accommodation starts to exceed sedimentation rate After this point the facies stacking pattern changes showing a deepening upward pattern that indicates the beginning of the lake expansion and the progressive increase in water depth characterizing the expanding lake regime facies tract ELRT The geological record encompasses numerous sequences which have different origins and are related to a broad spectrum of temporal and spatial scales therefore a hierarchization in terms of their nested patterns becomes fundamental The sequence hierarchical method is independent of the time involved and the base level variation magnitude and its allogeneic controls Catuneanu 2006 In this approach the relative importance of the events that lead to sequence boundary development is primarily measured by analysing the facies stacking patterns that emerged from a balance between accommodation and sedimentation rates that consequently produced depositional trends Following this logic the small scale sequences high frequency usually having a thickness of a few metres embrace a set of elementary sequences very high frequency usually decimetric in scale Fig 16 Groups of small scale sequences form the so called medium scale sequences medium frequency which are tens of metres thick Finally an ensemble of medium scale sequences composes the large scale sequences low frequency with hundreds of metres in thickness Fig 17 The analysis of the facies proportion trends of the elementary sequences allows the identiﬁcation of small scale sequences Sedimentary successions showing a predominance of elementary sequences of ELRTs indicate a trend of water body dilution induced by high rainfall rates which caused a progressive expansion and lake level rise during a smallscale sequence period An inversion of this stacking pattern represented by an increase in the proportion of elementary sequences of RLRTs deﬁnes the small scale sequence MES From this point on an increase in the lake water alkalinity associated with high evaporation rates resulted in a progressive retraction and lake level fall in a small scale sequence span The small scale sequence MRS records another inversion in this stacking pattern where the proportion of ELRTs starts to increase This surface symbolizes the minimum accommodation within a small scale sequence formation period The largeand medium scale sequences were deﬁned using the same logic as the small scale sequences being identiﬁed by analysing the facies proportion trends associated with periods of lake expansion and retraction in the medium and small scale sequences Reservoir zonation The analysis of sequence stacking patterns and the correlation of their most traceable and relevant

M OLIVEIRA2 1 Geosciences Institute Rio Grande do Sul Federal University Porto Alegre RS Brazil 2 Petrobras Research Center CENPES Rio de Janeiro RJ Brazil email lfderos inf ufrgs br The giant Aptian reservoirs and associated lacustrine rocks of the South Atlantic pre salt section present a series of unique characteristics which make the systems created for marine carbonate rocks quite inadequate for their classification Based on our experience with the characterization of thousands of samples of the pre salt reservoirs and associated deposits from the Brazilian basins and on a wide literature evaluation we propose an objective and operational system for the classification of the unusual yet extremely important pre salt lacustrine rocks The system allows the coherent record of structure fabric primary texture and composition and main diagenetic modifications of the in situ and resedimented rock types The in situ rocks are directly classified according to the original proportion among calcite spherulites fascicular shrubs and mud matrix The resedimented rocks are classified according to the original volume of 2 mm particles and the proportion between sand and mud using calcirudite calcarenite and calcilutite as unbiased names Such an approach can also be applied to the classification of other particulate carbonate rocks avoiding the conceptual problems and dubious interpretation of depositional environment and reservoir quality of currently used classification systems The direct objective and intuitive proposed classification system shall contribute to the understanding exploration and production of the extraordinary South Atlantic pre salt petroleum province ABSTRACT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRE SALT ROCKS During the last fifteen years a series of giant hydrocarbon accumulations were discovered in very unusual Aptian reservoirs of the Santos Campos and Kwanza basins along the Brazilian and African South Atlantic margins e g Carminatti et al 2008

deposits were formed in a vast lacustrine system which probably covered more than 1 000 000 km2 along the large sag depression generated by the early separation between Africa and South America Davison 2007 Chaboureau et al 2013 Szatmari et al 2021 Fig 1 The tectonic setting which included extensive magmatism Szatmari and Milani 2016 associated hydrothermal activity Teboul et al 2017 Souza et al 2018 Lima et al 2020 and also potentially mantle exhumation Szatmari and Milani 2016 Pinto et al 2017 Wright 2022 and the arid climatic conditions Pietzsch et al 2020 Lawson et al 2022 created an alkaline lacustrine environment with elevated activities of Mg Ca Si Cl and HCO3 Under these conditions the in situ pre salt deposits were generated by chemical precipitation in the water column as well as at or just below the lake bottom recorded by a combination of only three components magnesian clay matrix calcite spherulites and shrubs The background of the lacustrine sedimentation which represents the recurrent substrate for the precipitation of the other constituents in the depositional cycles consists of authigenic syngenetic magnesian phyllosilicates represented mostly by stevensite a magnesian smectite kerolite a hydrated form of talc or interstratified mixed layers between the two Published Online October 2023 Copyright Ó 2023 SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology Carramal et al 2022 These minerals precipitated by homogeneous nucleation as clay size particles that accumulated as low energy laminated deposits Fig 2A or as silt to fine sand size peloids Fig 2B Some authors e g Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 suggest that these magnesian clays may have originally been deposited as a Mg Si gel later crystallized However the voluminous and recurrent deposition of the Mg clays would not be possible as a gel considering the extremely slow settling of colloidal particles Stokes Law Besides the excellent parallel orientation of the laminated deposits Fig 2C is incompatible with their crystallization from a gel and their deformation by the very early precipitation of calcite spherulites and shrubs just below sediment water interface indicates their original depositional parallel orientation The precipitation of the calcite spherulites commonly occurred very close to the sediment water interface as indicated by the common nucleation of shrubs on spherulites and by the occurrence of transitional forms such as asymmetric vertically elongated spherulites Mixed with the Mg clays there are subordinate amounts of detrital clays transformed mostly to interstratified illite smectite on burial and silt quartz feldspars and micas mostly and rare ostracod and bacterial or algal bioclasts The laminated Mg clays were heterogeneously often strongly replaced by microcrystalline dolomite silica and dominantly calcite Fig 2D thus their misidentification as carbonate mud deposits in several published works Wright and

Geological Characterization and Modeling of an Aptian Carbonate Reservoir in the Santos Basin Brazil Ana Paula Tanaka1 Desiree Faria1 João Paulo Gomes1 and Olinto de Souza Jr1 Search and Discovery Article 11128 2018 Posted September 17 2018 Adapted from oral presentation given at AAPG 2018 AAPG Annual Convention and Exhibition Salt Lake City Utah May 20 23 2018 Datapages 2018 Serial rights given by author For all other rights contact author directly DOI 10 1306 11128Tanaka2018 1 Petrobras S A Rio de Janeiro Rio de Janeiro Brazil desiree lpfaria gmail com Abstract The offshore of Santos Basin in the Brazilian Southeastern continental margin accommodates a huge hydrocarbon province In the early 2000 s oil discoveries in deep and ultra deep waters located in the Barremian Aptian carbonate section brought a new economic interest to the area In this work we will focus on an Aptian carbonate platform which composes one of the most prolific oil fields of this province The work aims to present the geological context of the area and propose a workflow for the geological characterization and modeling to better understand the spatial distribution of the sedimentary facies and permo porosity that can define preferential producing stratigraphic zones and flow paths For this goal the geological model represented by the structural stratigraphic facies and permo porosity models will be presented Sedimentological studies identified five main carbonate facies in the studied sequence grainstones stromatolites shrubs spherulitites laminites and wackestones mudstones The cycles defined by facies successions allowed the interpretation of stratigraphic surfaces that can be correlated throughout the field and separate the section into five main zones A stratigraphic sedimentological forward facies model was constructed to reproduce the sedimentary stacking pattern observed from well data based on the simulation and tests of different parameters that act in the depositional process of carbonate rocks base level oscillations and carbonate depositional rate The facies model is used to guide the permo porosity distribution The permeability distribution requires the definition of rock types with different classes of permeability and fracture zones Based on 3D forward modeling the best set of environmental conditions able to explain the pattern of carbonate deposition observed in the study area are a slow carbonate depositional rate and lake level oscillations which were essentially induced by arid climatic conditions In terms of reservoir quality the better reservoir facies are stromatolites and grainstones The higher permeabilities are a combination of the primary porosity connection increased by dissolution and fractures The integration of this work allows an understanding of the sedimentological processes acting in the platform the facies and permo porosity distribution between wells and helps in the improvement of the predictability of the production curves that can be confirmed by real production performance

International Journal of Earth Sciences high geological complexity of the carbonate reservoirs is a scientific frontier that has been broadly discussed in the last decade Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 Muniz et al 2015 Ceraldi and Green 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 as these reservoirs may be considered non conventional deposits with very few analogues in the world and are relatively poorly understood in relation to the siliciclastic reservoirs Nakano et al 2009 The pre salt carbonates were deposited in lacustrine environments related to the development of rift and sag basins during the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent and opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Late Jurassic Early Cretaceous Chang et al 1992 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Mohriak et al 2008 Therefore genetically linked pre salt plays i e counterparts can be found on both sides of the South Atlantic occurring in the Brazilian Santos Campos and Espírito Santo Basins Carminatti et al 2008 Wright and Barnett 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 as well as in the west African Namibe Kwanza Congo and Gabon Basins Brownfield and Charpentier 2006 Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2016 The Brazilian and African pre salt plays alongside other important discoveries in China have placed continental and lacustrine carbonates into the spotlight Herlinger et al 2017 Lacustrine carbonate environments are very dynamic and sensitive systems High and low frequency changes in climate water chemistry and bathymetry result in significant variations of litho and biofacies and their lateral and vertical distribution patterns Flügel 2010 The environmental oscillations control a complex interplay of depositional processes which are mainly dominated by biogenic mediated sedimentation abiotic chemical precipitation variable carbonate clastic input and eolian supply Gierlowski Kordesch 2010 Among these processes the biotic contribution to the pre salt main reservoir facies is still a point of major controversy as these deposits were historically classified as microbialites Moreira et al 2007 Terra et al 2010 and recently new abiotic related models and interpretations are emerging Wright and Barnett 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 The variety of depositional processes the diverse nature of the carbonates added to the high chemical reactivity of the carbonate minerals and their tendency toward a complex diagenetic history can generate very heterogeneous poroperm systems Rezende and Pope 2015 quantitatively related depositional texture characteristics such as size sorting and packing to the porosity and permeability of the microbialites from the Santos Basin corroborating the importance of the depositional process on primary porosity On the other hand Herlinger et al 2017 characterized the complex diagenetic pathways of the pre salt carbonates from the Campos Basin and their impact on permeability and porosity indicating that diagenesis is capable of changing potential primary reservoirs into poor quality reservoirs or non reservoirs 13 In this context the purpose of this study is to present new data and interpretations on the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Aptian Barra Velha Formation from the Santos Basin offshore Brazil To do so an integrated stratigraphic sedimentological and petrophysical study of a target core interval was carried out seeking to understand how the depositional framework evolved and how the post depositional process affected the poroperm systems This work presents qualitative and quantitative analysis regarding the main presalt sag phase facies that are common in many oilfields in the South Atlantic Basins and our intention is for this work to contribute to general knowledge on lacustrine carbonate reservoirs Geological setting The Santos Basin is a passive margin basin located in the southeastern part of the Brazilian continental margin covering a total area of c 350 000 km2 between the states of Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina It is bounded in the NE by the Cabo Frio High and in the SW by the Florianopolis Platform defining its borders with the Campos and Pelotas Basins respectively Fig 1 Moreira et al 2007 The basin was formed under an extensional tectonic regime during the rupture of the Gondwana supercontinent in the Late Jurassic Early Cretaceous which led to the separation of South America and Africa and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean Chang et al 1992 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Mohriak et al 2008 The break up of western Gondwana took nearly 40 million years from the early Valanginian to the late Albian Szatmari 2000 The basin fill history of the Santos Basin can be subdivided into three megasequences 1 rift 138 123 My 2 post rift sag 123 113 My and 3 drift 113 0 My Moreira et al 2007 Fig 2 Initially the weakened and thin continental crust was strongly affected by tensional fractures that later became conduits for magma Herz 1977 the intense volcanism characterized by the Camboriú Formation basalts mark the beginning of the rift phase and development of the economic basement of the Santos Basin Chang et al 1992 Mohriak et al 2008 With the gradual evolution of the rift system the Camboriú Formation was overlain by the fluvio lacustrine deposits of the Piçarras and Itapema Formations which are dominated by sandstones siltstones and shales of talc stevensitic composition and coquinas interlayered with shales respectively Moreira et al 2007 Thermal contraction of the crust resulted in the subsidence and collapse of crustal domes generating sag type basins Beasley et al

International Journal of Earth Sciences associated to highly saturated and alkaline lacustrine waters The formation is bordered at its base by the Pre Alagoas unconformity separating the microbialite lake system from the older bivalve coquina dominated lakes At the top the formation is overlain by transitional evaporites of the Ariri Formation Moreira et al 2007 Mohriak et al 2008 Quirk et al 2013 The Ariri Formation evaporites were deposited in a paleogeographic scenario similar to a gulf with highly saline waters and negative hydrological balance Chang et al 1992 The evaporite interval has a highly variable thickness due to halokinesis but may be as thick as 2 km and it is composed of a lower layer of anhydrite overlain by halite and other salt minerals creating a regional seal Moreira et al 2007 Beasley et al 2010 Exploration targets in the strata above the evaporites are commonly referred to as post salt or suprasalt prospects and the ones below are called pre salt The post salt deposits occurred during the drift phase which is characterized by the development of a passive margin and represents the definitive establishment of marine settings comprising the Camburi Frade and Itamambuca Groups Moreira et al 2007 RES 40 μm equipment at the Laboratory of Porous Media and Thermophysical Properties of the Federal University of Santa Catarina LMPT UFSC After the acquisition of the two dimensional data cross sections the three dimensional models were created by stacking these sections in the PerGeos software where the images were also binarized for the determination and quantification of the porous phase The nuclear magnetic resonance NMR analysis was carried out in a GeoSpec 2 53 Maran DRX HF 2 24 MHz equipment by Oxford Instruments at CEPETRO UNICAMP all samples were saturated with deionized water In order to define the T2 transverse relaxation time cutoff that separates the FFI free fluid index and BVI Bulk volume irreducible areas the centrifuge method was used The 100 saturated samples were centrifuged air water to determine the irreducible water saturation Swir After centrifugation the samples underwent a new NMR measurement thus obtaining the Swir curve for each sample Methods The studied core interval of the Barra Velha Formation was grouped into 6 depositional facies F1 F6 Fig 3 1 shrubby framestones 2 intraclastic grainstones rudstones 3 spherulitic packstones grainstones and hybrid forms 4 laminated dolomudstones 5 shrubby framestones and hybrid forms and 6 spherulitic grainstones intercalated with shrubby framestones Each facies is formed by different associations of five key textural components 1 crystal shrubs 2 calcite spherulites 3 hybrid forms 4 mudgrade carbonates and dolomite and 5 intraclasts Facies dominated by crystal shrubs spherulites and hybrid forms F1 F3 F5 and F6 are the most recurrent comprising about 80 of the entire interval These facies are generally characterized by autochthonous deposits with subordinated occurrences of transported sediments Facies dominated by reworked grains mainly intraclasts F2 correspond to approximately 15 of the total and dolomudstones with minor clay content add up to 5 of the total The identified depositional facies are described below This study is based on c 8 m of core samples 30 petrographic thin sections and 11 plugs of a vertical well herein named SB A1 comprising the Barra Velha Formation from the Santos Basin Restrictions placed by one partner company preclude the disclosure of depths well names and oil fields The applied methods include optical petrography plane polarized light PL crossed polarized light XPL petrographic image analysis X ray computed tomography CT scan nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and conventional poroperm gas tests The petrographic image analysis was performed on thin section high definition images obtained from a transmitted light scanner with 6400 dpi resolution The analyzed thin sections were stained with an acid solution of alizarin red for calcite dolomite differentiation and impregnated with blue epoxy resin to improve the porous space characterization The scan images were binarized which enabled the separation of the porous blue epoxy resin and non porous space matrix grains and cement through RGB curves The binarization and segmentation process was performed with the PerGeos software v 1 5 CT scan data acquisition of core samples was performed on a Siemens industrial tomography device model SWFVD30C RES 100 μm at the Center for Petroleum Studies of the University of Campinas CEPETRO UNICAMP In addition high resolution CT images from plugs were acquired in a ZEISS XRadia Versa XRM 500 Scanner 13 Results Sag depositional facies Shrubby framestones F1 The shrubby framestones facies occur in beds with an average thickness of c 0 9 m consisting of millimeter tocentimeter thick layers of in situ crystal shrub crusts with secondary concentrations of spherulites intraclasts and phosphatic bioclasts The shrub like growths are the main textural components of this facies and they are characterized by non magnesian fibrous radial calcite crystals with

The most common porosity occurs as growth framework pores among crystal shrubs and their branches Fig 4e Intraparticle intra shrub porosity created by calcite dissolution occurs as micropores irregularly disseminate through the shrub or can be oriented by internal structures following growth bands and radial crystals Fig 4e Finally irregular microfractures may also occur although they are not as common as the other types of porosity Fig 4e In most cases c 75 of the thin sections the primary growth framework porosity is partially filled by dolomite and silica cement Fig 4b d f the main diagenetic constituents of these deposits Dolomite occurs as rhombohedral crystals with variable intercrystalline porosity or as isopachous crystals around the calcite fabric Dolomitic cement varies in abundance from nearly absent to pore obliterating mosaics Silica occurs as prismatic coarse quartz microporous microcrystalline quartz and fibrous chalcedony different silica varieties may occur concomitantly in the same pore space Pervasive silicification and dolomitization partially replace the calcite fabric in certain restricted intervals that are usually associated to low porosity Intraclastic grainstones and rudstones F2 Intraclastic grainstones rudstones occur in a single 1 10 m thick interval and are characterized by calcitic detrital grains Fig 5 commonly interlayered with thin levels of crystal shrub crusts This facies is generally grain supported c 85 of the thin sections and composed of coarse sand to pebble grade reworked fragments of crystal shrub crusts spherulites dolomudstones silicified particles phosphatic bioclasts and pisoids The fabric is characterized by poor size sorting tight packing and significant grain shape diversity ranging from spherical and well rounded to irregular and very angular grains Fig 5a e In general coarser intraclasts present preserved internal structure such as radial and fascicular crystal habit of spherulites and shrubs which are usually unclear in the fine grained sediments Some spherical to elliptical grains also present well defined concentric internal laminations and resemble pisoids Fig 5b c Phosphatic bioclasts Fig 5f are also common and occur in small amounts usually less than 3 fragments per thin section These fragments consist of apatite and occur as elongate fragments up to 10 mm or as irregular particles resembling skeletal elements Most of the bioclastic fragments were affected by micritization and fracturing due to compaction The primary depositional texture of F2 facies was mainly affected by silicification and dolomite cementation that obstructed most of the primary interparticle porosity in the majority of the analyzed thin sections both processes seem to be more intense in this facies than in the shrubby framestones In addition the intraclasts were strongly affected by internal dissolution and developed high intraparticle porosity One thin section shows evidence of strong matrix dissolution resulting in extreme porosity Fig 5e corresponding to a restricted 3 cm porous layer in the core Open fractures occur in low spatial density Spherulitic packstones grainstones and hybrid forms F3 Spherulitic packstones and grainstones facies occur in beds 30 80 cm thick consisting of millimeter to centimeter thick layers of spherulites intercalated or in gradational pattern to transitional grain types between shrubs and spherulites here called hybrid forms Fig 6 Carbonate spherulites are defined as spherical to elliptical grains composed of a radiating array of either calcite or aragonite crystals Chafetz et al 2018 The calcite spherulites present a diameter ranging from 0 1 to 2 mm and are easily recognized under crossed polarized light by the dark cross shaped radial figure Fig 6d h It is common for spherulites to present small micritic or microsparitic nuclei which are frequently dissolved leaving a moldic void Fig 6h Some spherulites show evidence of transport and reworking such as fragmentation and fracturing whereas others seem to have grown in situ with good morphology preservation and good size sorting The hybrid forms were previously described by Saller et al 2016 as transitional grains between spherulites and crystal shrubs These hybrid grains have characteristics of both shrubs and spherulites featuring spherical bases associated to asymmetric cross shaped figures under crossedpolarized light and are elongate perpendicular to the bedding with variable branching levels Fig 6e f The hybrid forms range from asymmetric spherulites to well developed and branched structures up to 4 mm in length The spherulites and hybrid forms occur as grainstones and packstones with interparticle porosity variably affected by cementation and dissolution Similar to the previously described facies dolomite and silica are the main types of cement Fig 6c f pervasive dolomitization is relatively common and may destroy the spherulites original morphology and obliterate primary porosity Fig 6g In addition burial compaction reduced the interparticle porosity and 13

International Journal of Earth Sciences fabric consists of mud grade carbonate debris with occasional calcite particles up to 0 5 mm in size blocky dolomite crystals usually smaller than 0 1 mm in size and common phosphatic bioclasts Silicification is the most striking feature of this facies and occurs in the form of abundant silica layers and nodules Fig 7a b d which may be as extensive as the core diameter Silica occurs mainly as microcrystalline quartz or chalcedony and may present high microporosity The porous system of these dolomudstones is characterized by small intercrystalline and interparticle porosity possibly enhanced by dissolution Fig 7c Fracture porosity is also commonly associated with this facies as a significant amount of irregular and continuous fractures with apertures varying from 0 1 to 0 5 mm occur Some of those fractures are partially or completely filled by silica and opaque heavy minerals Shrubby framestones and hybrid forms F5 The shrubby framestones and hybrid form facies occur in a single interval c 70 cm thick and it is characterized by centimeter thick layers of crystal shrubs and well developed hybrid forms with subordinated spherulite occurrences This facies differs from facies 1 and 3 by the abundance and development level of the hybrid forms greater L W ratio and branching degree possibly constituting an intermediate occurrence between these two facies The diagenetic modifications are similar to facies 1 and 3 dolomite and silica cementation partially fill the primary growth framework pore space Spherulitic grainstones intercalated with shrubby framestones F6 High frequency intercalation of millimeter to centimeter thick layers of spherulitic grainstones and shrubby framestones occur in a single interval c 95 cm thick The occurrences of crystal shrubs and spherulites in this facies repeat the same textural features of previous occurrences F1 and F3 with well developed dendritic shrubs and spherical in situ spherulites Dolomitic and silica cementation and dissolution processes vary in amount from layer to layer affecting primary growth framework and interparticle porosity Petrophysics Petrographic image analysis Petrographic image analysis was applied to 30 petrographic thin sections in order to estimate porosity and to provide initial data on pore type and pore size distribution Table 1 presents the average porosity and the main pore types for the different textural components and diagenetic conditions The overall porosity ranges between 0 05 and 42 8 average 6 54 standard deviation 2 86 Samples dominated by crystal shrub crusts hybrid forms and calcite spherulites with preserved or enhanced growth framework and interparticle pores respectively present the highest porosities 5 Φ 20 Thin sections showing crystal shrubs hybrid forms and spherulites strongly affected by cementation and mud size carbonate present the lowest porosity Φ 5 Samples of intraclastic composition in general present intermediate porosity values 1 Φ 10 with the exception of an anomalous sample of 42 8 porosity associated to an extreme dissolution process Fig 5e Four common relationships between the main fabrics of the studied interval and different pore systems are illustrated in Fig 8 Shrubby framestones samples with high growth framework porosity and spherulitic grainstones with enhanced interparticle pores present the highest pore area range with pores larger than 1 mm2 As displayed in Fig 8a b by crystal shrub and spherulite samples pores larger than 0 01 mm2 represent less than 1 10 of the total number of pores but correspond to 63 and 80 9 of the total porosity respectively The majority of the intraclastic grainstones rudstones samples presented intense cementation by dolomite and silica and although they may also present millimeter scale pores tend to be dominated by small area intraparticle pores As can be observed from the sample shown in Fig 8c porosity is mainly limited within the intraclastic grains and the pore area analysis indicates that pores smaller than 0 01 mm2 add most of the porosity 63 3 Mud grade carbonates and dolomite samples associated to dolomudstone facies presented low porosity dominated by very small area interparticle and intercrystalline pores in the sample presented in Fig 8d pore areas smaller than 0 01 mm2 correspond to 78 8 of the total porosity Core samples CT scan A representative 1 3 m core subinterval featuring the main facies and textural components of the studied interval was chosen for a continuous CT scan data acquisition Fig 9 The CT scan data enabled us not only to segment and calculate porosity but also to improve the sedimentological characterization However due to the resolution of the CT scan device the pore size recognition was limited to pores larger than 100 μm certainly underestimating the total porosity As shown by petrographic image analysis pore systems of intervals dominated by intraparticle intercrystalline and small interparticle growth framework pores were probably not detected by the CT scan data acquisition The detected macroporosity ranges between almost null to c 8 and its vertical profile is characterized by high porosity peaks that are a few centimeters thick intercalated 13

zones Although the porosity peaks are mainly associated with the specific lithological related porous systems such as the shrubby framestones dominated by high growth framework porosity and intraclastic rudstones characterized by interparticle porosity the porosity profile poorly corresponds to the lithological variations This behavior is expected to be related to intervals particularly affected by dolomite and silica cementation Due to differences in mass density and atomic number of the composed silica and carbonate minerals they present different X ray attenuation coefficients For most of the X ray energy spectrum quartz is substantially less attenuating than calcite resulting in darker gray values in the tomography image Vlassenbroeck et al 2007 Saur et al 2020 Centimeter size irregular and pervasive silica layers and nodules can be recognized throughout the entire interval and are associated to null or low macroporosity zones In addition the CT data enabled the clear identification of high density heavy minerals highly attenuating which appear as bright spots in the tomography image The occurrence of heavy minerals is mainly associated to dolomudstones F4 and intraclastic grainstone rudstones F2 and as crystals filling fractures along with silica or associated to silicified layers High resolution CT scan and NMR High resolution CT scan NMR and conventional gas tests were applied to eleven 40 mm diameter plugs that represent the main depositional facies and textural components of the studied interval The results are listed in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig 10 Gas tests and NMR porosity measurements are close and as expected highlight the high heterogeneity of the reservoir the porosity values range from 2 69 to 26 32 and 2 36 to 21 21 respectively The highest poroperm values are associated with samples dominated by crystal shrubs Bp2 Bp4 Bp11 and calcite spherulites affected by matrix dissolution Bp5 The porosity estimated by high resolution CT scan data segmentation diverges in relation to gas injection and NMR results with values 55 5 99 6 lower ranging from 0 01 to 11 7 Even with a higher resolution 40 μm than the conventional CT scan 100 μm applied to core samples the CT scan of plugs was still unable to detect a significant amount of the pore volume As evidenced by the irreducible water saturation analysis SWI samples such as Bp1 Bp6 Bp7 and Bp9 are dominated by microporosity generally 4 μm which is far below the tomography resolution resulting in segmented porosity values close to zero In addition all samples except Bp11 and Bp5 presented zero pore connectivity in the CT data Although porosity recognition was partial CT scan data revealed important information on fabric characteristics and macroporosity distribution Fig 11 Pore volume distribution followed similar patterns for crystal shrubs and reworked spherulites Fig 11a c as observed in the petrographic image analysis Fig 8a b with larger pores 0 01 mm3 dominating total porosity The total porosity of samples constituted of intraclasts also appears to be dominated by large volume pores Fig 11e however small intraparticle pores commonly associated with this lithology Fig 8c were not detected by CT scan segmentation and the darker grey shades lower density of these grains indicates the presence of abundant internal porosity Although sample Bp10 presents moderately high porosity Φgas 17 48 ΦNMR 12 46 the sample is characterized by low permeability k 0 0093 mD which is possibly associated with the cementation process that isolated interparticle pores between intraclasts Textural components and even diagenetic features were significantly better defined in high resolution CT scan The absence of porosity observed in core CT scan of facies F3 Fig 9 was also registered in the high resolution CT scan of sample Bp9 Fig 11d The plug sample was affected by pervasive silicification dark grey in tomography image that almost obliterated interparticle pores and possibly replaced the matrix resulting in spherulites and hybrid forms floating in silica cement In this sample the detected porosity 0 01 is mostly made up of isolated small intraparticle pores In contrast sample Bp5 also constituted of spherulites but rather reworked and associated with intense matrix dissolution presented the highest poroperm values Φgas 26 32 ΦNMR 21 21 k 1436 33 mD This sample is characterized by unobstructed and highly connected interparticle pores similar to those observed in poorly cemented oolitic grainstones In this sample 90 of the segmented porosity is

growth Folk et al 1985 Pentecost and Coletta 2007 Rainey and Jones 2009 The carbonate shrubs analyzed in this work were classified as crystal shrubs Chafetz and Guidry 1999 dominated by abiotic mineral precipitation mainly due to the distinct crystal habits and regular repeating morphologies contrasting with what would be expected for complete bacterial shrubs which tend to exhibit irregular morphologies composed of micritic aggregates related to the bacterial clumps Fig 12 Typical examples of bacterial shrubs from analogous travertine systems can be found in Chafetz and Guidry 1999 Claes et al 2017 and Erthal et al 2017 Shrubby fabrics in pre salt deposits are widely regarded as being formed in very saline to alkaline environments but interpretations and models differ in relation to the dominant control factors on the distribution of facies between oscillations in bathymetry accommodation space and environmental energy Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2016 geochemistry and evaporation refilling cycles Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Tosca 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2016 and hydrogeochemistry focusing on the type of water sourcing the lake and the leakage to aquifers MercedesMartín et al 2019 Here we interpreted the shrub dominated facies F1 and F5 to be formed during lowstand shallow and highly saturated waters associated to a moderate to high energy environment Fig 13b Several studies on calcite shrub morphology indicate that hydrodynamic conditions and flow energy play an important role on shrub morphology development Pentecost and Viles 1994 Rainey and Jones 2009 Okumura et al 2012 Erthal et al 2017 According to studies performed by Erthal et al 2017 on shrubby abundant travertines the increase of the flow rates enhances precipitation rates decreases microbial influence and develop denser and more complex morphologies In addition the stratigraphic proximity and sometimes interlayering between crystal shrubs and coarse intraclastic grains reinforces the idea of energetic shallow conditions Formation of calcite spherulites According to Saller et al 2016 in the sag section of the Kwanza Basin there is no clear separation between the precipitation of depositional carbonates and the early diagenetic features These circumstances seem to be recurrent in many pre salt formations Herlinger et al 2017 found petrographic evidence that calcite spherulites from the Campos Basin are an eogenetic constituent replacing and displacing the original unconsolidated sediment or gel Whereas Saller et al 2016 consider spherulites as well as shrubs to be depositional precipitates The Barra Velha Formation spherulites have been interpreted to form and nucleate inside unconsolidated muddy sediments or gels in a hyper alkaline environment Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 According to Wright and Barnett 2015 when there was a rapid deposition of a Mg silicate gel talc stevensite precursor the substrate was unsuitable for shrub growth and favored the nucleation of spherulites inside the gel In addition the formation of insitu spherulites would probably require water that was deep enough to have limited current agitation Saller et al 2016 According to the model proposed by Chafetz et al 2018 for the Brazilian pre salt spherulites these allochems formed around fine grained micritic nuclei possibly microbialrelated in the water column Fig 13d The micritic core is then enveloped by calcite seed crystals by microbialinduced precipitation and settles at the bottom of the lake The presence of the seed crystal facilitates the growth of abiotic cortices in the sediment water interface This model justifies the presence of the nucleus in most spherulites in the studied interval and the well developed crystal habits of the spherulite cortices Formation of hybrid forms Facies 3 and 5 present morphologically intermediate forms between spherulites and crystal shrubs According to Saller et al 2016 the morphology of the calcite precipitate is a function of depositional energy degree of supersaturation and substrate Therefore the hybrid forms may be formed in transitional environments time and space between those required for the formation of spherulites and shrubs Fig 13c Asymmetrical spherulite growth was probably facilitated by the proximity to the sediment water interface associated with moderate to low Mg silicate precipitation rates in a more energetic environment than the one associated to spherulite nucleation These settings allowed the spherulites to grow into the water column and develop dendritic morphological patterns Genesis of the detrital facies Intraclastic grainstones and rudstones in the sag phase of the Campos and Kwanza Basins have been interpreted as being formed in shallow and high energy environments Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2016 During lowstand older deposits were reworked and transported by relatively strong 13

International Journal of Earth Sciences triggered by the lake water freshening Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Dolomite and silicification Herlinger et al 2017 considers five main patterns for dolomite precipitation in the sag section of the Campos Basin 1 early dolomite that grew inside the unconsolidated sediment 2 mimetic replacement of stevensite lamination 3 pore filling cement 4 pervasive replacement of the rock and 5 saddle dolomite associated to fracturing Saller et al 2016 also identified patterns 3 and 4 in the sag section of the Kwanza Basin and suggested the occurrence of primary crystalline dolomite precipitated directly from the lake water In the studied interval the main occurrence of dolomite is as pore filling cement partially or totally obliterating the primary porosity and or dissolution related pores In addition dolomite also occurs as a partial replacement of the calcitic fabric dolomitization which is mainly associated to thin and highly cemented intervals Dolomite bridges as those identified by Wright and Barnett 2015 2017 as the mimetic replacement of clay matrices such as stevensite are rare and uncertain in the analyzed interval as well as the occurrence of stevensite itself Although stevensite is an abundant constituent of the pre salt deposits in the studied interval its virtual absence may be related to the small sample size and to intense diagenetic overprint Apart from dolomite silica is a major diagenetic constituent and creator of reservoir heterogeneity As previously stated displacive silica nodules and thin concordant silica layers associated to facies F4 probably have a depositional to early diagenetic origin associated to a drop in pH However irregular and pervasive silicification and silica filled fractures associated to heavy minerals points to a late and possible polyphase origin Hydrothermal circulation of deep sourced fluids has been proposed in the Brazilian pre salt settings Herlinger et al 2017 to be linked with processes such as dissolution intense fracturing silicification dolomitization and crystallization of barite fluorite pyrite and other sulfides Vieira de Luca et al 2017 and Tritlla et al 2019 identified late hightemperature hydrothermal silicification in the Campos Basin including features such as quartz veins stockworks and hydrothermal breccias Facies succession and cyclicity Wide variations on spatial and temporal distributions of facies occur in the South Atlantic lacustrine carbonates and different facies may occur according to the well position 13 relative to paleobathymetric trends Ceraldi and Green 2016 However similar facies succession patterns have been noted such as the cyclothem proposed by Wright and Barnett 2015 Fig 3 and the shallowing upwards sequence identified by Ceraldi and Green 2016 Figure 13 compiles elements from several studies on the pre salt carbonates showing a schematic evolution model for the observed facies and its relationship to the main environmental factors proposed to control the succession of facies A hypothesized sequence begins with deep low energy fresher water laminated dolomudstones F4 followed by alkaline low energy spherulitic wackestones grading to grainstones F3 and F4 progressing to shallow water hybrid forms and shrub dominated framestones F5 and F1 and finally intraclastic grainstones and rudstones F2 F1 and F2 appear to be easily interchangeable due to shallow reworking Detrital intraclastic facies may also occur in different moments of the cycle depending on high energy events or tectonically induced transformations on local base level Petrophysical properties and reservoir control The shrub dominated facies were considered the best sag phase reservoirs in the Campos Herlinger et al 2017 Santos Wright and Tosca 2016 and Kwanza Saller et al 2016 Basins This is due to high growth framework porosity and fair permeability added to the relative abundance of these facies in many pre salt fields However for the sag phase deposits the link between depositional facies and reservoir quality must be considered with caution A wide range of poroperm values was identified by Herlinger et al 2017 for similar shrub dominated facies coalescent crust from the sag phase of the Campos Basin Φgas 0 2 16 1 k 0 001 295 000 mD Similar petrophysical heterogeneity was identified for shrub dominated samples from the Barra Velha Formation Φgas 0 74 17 44 k 0 001 25 00 mD in this study These wide variations show that the reservoir potential for shrub dominated facies may be attenuated or obliterated by post depositional processes Silica and dolomite cementation may modify large millimeter scale growth framework pores into numerous micropores that have little influence in permeability Herlinger et al 2017 through MICP analysis obtained an average microporosity of 37 50 and 50 94 for coalesced and non coalesced calcite crusts respectively The Swi analysis performed for shrub dominated samples resulted in similar results with an average of 49 7 micropores A similar degree of petrophysical heterogeneity occurs associated to spherulite and intraclast dominated facies with a wide range of reservoir qualities The potential of these

376 TAVARES ET AL INTRODUCTION Búzios is a supergiant oil and gas field with pre salt carbonate reservoirs covering an area around 852 km2 the hydrocarbon accumulation is situated in the northern Santos Basin in southeast Brazil approximately 180 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in 2 000 m of water Figure 1 The field was discovered in 2010 by Petrobras and was the most important find in the successful exploration campaign of the Barremian Aptian age lacustrine carbonate play in Brazil s offshore The Búzios Field is operated by Petrobras 90 stake in a consortium with CNODC 5 stake and CNOOC 5 stake Búzios is considered to possess the largest single field original oil in place OOIP volume ever discovered in Brazil ANP 2016 and currently reached a new record in terms of daily production 790 MBOE d and when full development is achieved the field will provide a dramatic increase in Brazilian daily production Petersohn 2019 The Santos Basin is characterized by one of the most prolific petroleum provinces in the deep water region of offshore Brazil with well known source rock and carbonate reservoirs associated with a l acustrine rift system This resulted in a prime hydrocarbon province with the largest offshore oil reserves discovered in the 21st century Berman 2008 C arminatti et al 2008 Mohriak 2015 The Santos B asin s current daily output of 2 58 MMBOE d makes it responsible for most of the Brazilian hydrocarbon production ANP 2020 SCOPE DATABASE AND METHODOLOGY This study focuses on describing the tectono stratigraphic framework of Búzios Field using public seismic well log and core data sets which were made available through the courtesy of the National Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency ANP Figure 1 Residual Bouguer gravity and regional location map Legend 1 Serra do Mar and Mantiqueira coastal ranges 2 Cretaceous hinge line 3 Florianópolis high 4 Cabo Frio high 5 ocean crust boundary 6 external high after Gomes et al 2012 7 Cruzeiro do Sul lineament 8 Florianópolis oceanic fracture zone 9 ANP pre salt polygon Búzios Field highlighted in magenta and black polygons are Santos and Campos fields

Búzios Field Geological Setting of the Largest Pre Salt Field Santos Basin Brazil 377 The seismic data set comprise a 3 D PSDM volume with 10 sec record length 4 msec sampling interval and 25 12 5 m bin size and five key exploration wells 2 ANP 1 RJS 3 BRSA 944A RJS 3 BRSA 1053 RJS 3 BRSA 1064 RJS and 9 BRSA 1159 RJS that were selected for well correlation well to seismic tie electric logs core image and thin sections photos used to interpret the reservoir facies distribution The core data from the well 3 BRSA 944A RJS were used to illustrate the main reservoir facies REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING The Santos Basin developed as part of an extensive continental rift system during the breakup of the western Gondwana Supercontinent in the Lower Cretaceous which then evolved into a passive divergent margin Moreira et al 2007 Chang et al 2008 and references therein The basin has an area of approximately 350 000 km 2 from the coastline to the salt limit at a bathymetry of about 3 000 m It is delimited to the north by the Cabo Frio High and to the south by the Florianópolis high which separates the Santos Basin from the Campos and Pelotas basins respectively Figure 1 The western margin of the basin is defined by the pre Aptian limit which separates the rift basin from the uplifted Precambrian rocks of the Ribeira Belt including the 2 000 m high Serra do Mar and Mantiqueira coastal ranges Figure 1 The eastern margin is characterized by the transition to oceanic crust with alternative boundaries p roposed by several authors e g Karner 2000 Mohriak 2001 Kumar et al 2012 The onshore Ribeira Belt continues underneath the offshore Santos Basin exerting a strong structural control during the rifting Schmitt et al 2008 The crustal inheritance in the offshore Santos Basin can be recognized in the northeast southwest and east northeast west southwest fault trends and in the subtle northwest southeast shear zones Authors such as Meisling et al 2001 and Rigoti 2015 consider that the shear zones became a significant structural control of the oblique rifting process of the basin resulting in a regional sinistral faulting and the generation of structural highs that conditioned the subsequent carbonate deposition The basin s sedimentary evolution took place in three main phases or mega sequences as follows the rift phase post rift or sag phase and drift phase Moreira et al 2007 Figure 2 The rift phase extends from the Hauterevian until the early Aptian and is divided into lower and upper intervals based on two different periods of tectonic activity separated by a seismically mappable unconformity Figure 2 The initial Hauterevian lower rift Karner and Driscoll 1999 created deep depocenters and a profuse trend of normal faults with north northeast south southwest orientation The main structures developed in this stage were half grabens associated with extensive synrift vulcanism known as the Camboriú Formation which constitutes the economic basement of the basin Szatmari 2000 Dias 2005 The Barremian aged upper rift includes alluvial and fluvial siliciclastic deposits in proximal settings that grade into organic rich shales in distal lacustrine environments These more distal facies in the lower rift form an important source rock known as the Piçarras Formation which directly overlies the basalts Figure 2 The late rift continued into the early Aptian depositing mudstones with organic rich intervals main source rock for the pre salt and coquina sequences into a restricted fluvio lacustrine environment This unit is known as the Itapema Formation and the coquinas which are mainly developed on structural highs constitute an important reservoir for the pre salt fields This interval is characterized by lesser tectonic activity and an increasing influence of thermal subsidence in the basin The end of this phase is defined by the Pre Alagoas Unconformity which is clearly expressed on seismic data as an angular unconformity Moreira et al 2007 Figure 2 Sedimentation in restricted conditions continued during Aptian into a phase of thermal subsidence termed the sag phase in which spherulites crystal shrubs laminites calci mudstone and stromatolites are predominantly observed These facies are known as Barra Velha Formation and include the most important reservoir rock types in pre salt fields Moreira et al 2007 The Barra Velha reservoirs are observed on numerous structural highs in the Santos Basin such as Lula Mero and Búzios fields The most important pre salt fields are located in the Santos Outer High Gomes et al 2012 Figures 1 3A Continued environmental restriction by the end of Aptian resulted in the deposition of an extensive evaporitic sequence the Ariri Formation which covered the pre salt sequence completely Regionally the Ariri Formation has been interpreted to be deposited in a relatively short period of time less than 1 000 000 Ma based on paleontological analysis of bounding sediments and initial salt deposits ranging from 200 m nearshore to 1 000 m thick in the central salt basin Moreira et al 2007 Gamboa et al 2009 This thick evaporitic unit serves as the predominant sealing layer for pre salt discoveries and provides the mechanism for the generation of post salt structures The

Silicification plays an important role in the quality of pre salt reservoirs resulting in significant heterogeneities that are difficult to predict A better understanding of the distribution of silicified pre salt reservoirs at the basin scale helps in mapping such heterogeneities and further optimizing responsible hydrocarbon exploration and production Here we investigate a scenario involving the interaction of an internal silica source from Mg rich clay sedimentary depositional facies and CO2 rich fluid upwelling along deep rooted faults These are some of the main controlling factors of silicification as confirmed with conceptual and numerical geochemical modeling We present a new modeling workflow integrating forward stratigraphic modeling FSM basin thermal modeling quantitative chemical modeling and map based analysis to derive silicification probability maps of the Barra Velha Formation in the Santos Basin Brazil FSM simulates with a process based approach the sediment distribution in the Barra Velha Formation including Mg rich clay Basin thermal modeling simulates the rock fluid systems evolution CO2 migration accumulation and concentration in the formation Geochemical modeling provides Mg clay transformation ratios depending on Mg clay content of rock matrix and CO2 concentration Combining all elements together enables calculation of basin scale silicification probability maps across the study area Highest probability of silicification is found above uplifted areas known to include Mg rich clay intense faulting and trapping structures 1 Introduction Silicification is a diagenetic process that affects carbonate aquifers and reservoirs by concurrent dissolution of calcium carbonate and pre cipitation of silica further complexifying the mineralogic heterogeneity of the host rocks and the associated flow properties Bustillo 2010 Such processes have been extensively reported in the pre salt conti nental carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian margin Fig 1 whereby not only calcium carbonate but also the magnesium clay Mg rich clay rock constituents are demonstrated to be replaced by silica Lima et al 2020 Pereira et al 2023 The silicified pre salt carbonates are also known to host world class petroleum systems Beltrao et al 2009 Jones and Chaves 2011 Petersohn 2019 Silicification is also believed to have affected other similar reservoirs such as those of the Kwanza basin on the African continental margin Saller et al 2016 While previous studies aimed at better understanding the implications of diagenetic processes such as silicification Almeida Carvalho et al 2022 on the associated evolution of the reservoir characteristics Lima et al 2020 Pereira et al 2023 often by means of various analytical and static modeling methods Nader 2017 no predictive process based basin scale mapping of silicification has been done Previous approaches are essential to understand the controlling factors of such processes and provide the basics for constructing predictive numerical models to delineate the spatial and temporal distribution of silicification across sedimentary basins and reservoirs especially when only few sub surface data are available The Barra Velha Formation includes broadly silicified reservoir zones as well as major hydrocarbon reservoirs Lima et al 2020 Vieira 2021 Vieira de Luca et al 2017 Silicified intervals are also affected by important carbonate dissolution e g vuggy hypogenic karst increasing considerably reservoir potentials Previous studies demon strated the relationship between

A B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 the origin of the observed silicified rock facies are not well constrained and could be multiple Some authors associated the silica supply with the alteration of volcanic products occurring in catchment areas lakes or the subsurface through hydrothermal activity Pietzsch et al 2020 Szatmari and Milani 2016 Teboul et al 2017 2019 Tosca and Wright 2015 Serpentinization of exhumed continental mantle has also been suggested as a source of solutes including silica Pinto et al 2017 Teboul et al 2019 Alternatively the alteration of Mg clays has been suggested to be the main source of Mg2 and SiO2 aq for the silicifica tion and dolomitization of in pre salt deposits Deocampo 2005 Tosca and Wright 2015 since Mg clays are known to be chemically labile and prone to rapid destabilization and dissolution during diagenesis Tosca 2014 Tosca and Wright 2015 In the case of an internal silica source understanding the initial sediment mineralogy distribution as well as the fluid properties and circulation via deeply rooted faults is essential to identify the most likely areas of silica precipitation Several phases of silicification are reported from petrographic anal ysis and proposed paragenesis Sartorato et al 2020 Vieira 2021 In this contribution we propose that the destabilization of Mg rich clays was the major driver for this first and most significant phase which is preceding hydrocarbon charge and the arrival of organic acids The major CO2 charge of the basin is assumed to be mantellic in origin de Freitas et al 2022 Based on this hypothesis we deduce that the sig nificant dissolution particularly of carbonates happened after the first phase of silicification The CO2 generated from organic matter maturation hydrocarbons and organic acids may have also contributed to the dissolution of Mg rich clays silicification and carbonate dissolu tion Their impact is considered minor compared to the first phase of silicification and consequently we did not take those processes into ac count Hydrocarbon generation migration and accumulation were still calculated in our model but we did not consider hydrocarbon fluid rock interactions The main objective of this study is to apply a new integrative workflow to predict the spatial distribution of silicification and its timing at the basin scale Fig 2 Our approach combines different nu merical modeling technologies to simulate in three dimensions the evolution of the basin over time including stratigraphy burial pressure and temperature salinity CO2 migration hydrocarbon generation and charge as well as diagenesis i e carbonate silicification We applied this workflow on the Santos basin offshore Brazil to demonstrate its feasibility and its ability to provide probable silicification maps across the basin First Forward Stratigraphic Modeling FSM which simulates sedimentation processes was applied together with sensitivity analysis modeling Then Basin Thermal Modeling was used to simulate the coupled transfers of fluids heat and chemicals Results of the principal process based simulators were combined with the output of a quanti tative geochemical simulation of the main parameters controlling silic ification Collard et al 2023 to process map based analysis and produce silification probability maps Fig 2 2 Geological setting The Santos Basin is one of the largest sedimentary basins along the Brazilian continental margin with a surface area of 352 000 km2 and a water depth of up to 3000m Fig 1 It is bounded to the south by the Floriano polis platform which forms its natural boundary with the Pe lotas basin To the north the Cabo Frio High separates it from the Campos basin These passive margin basins were formed in a Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous extensional regime during the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent which led to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean Chang et al 1990 Mohriak et al 2008 They are therefore also related to the Kwanza and Namibe basins offshore southwest Africa Saller et al 2016 The tectono stratigraphic evolution of the Santos basin is repre sented by three mega sequences that are associated to a rift phase 138 123 My a post rift sag phase 123 113 My and a drift phase 113 0 My Moreira et al 2007 These phases and related mega sequences are also characterized by major unconformities the Pre Alagoas unconformity which separates the rift and sag phases the Intra Alagoas unconformity and the salt base which marks the transi tion from the sag to the drift phase Fig 3

A B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 data mud dolomite calcite silica and Mg rich clay calcite spheru lites and fascicular calcite shrubs When the spherulites and shrubs were subject to erosion and transport their debris can form a fourth facies type referred to as the reworked facies The mud end member is composed of different clay minerals e g kerolite stevensite saponite illite and mixed layer minerals kerolite smectite and illite smectite Madrucci et al 2019 Souza et al 2018 Creamy to light brown in color it shows massive beds or plane parallel to smooth wavy laminations with thicknesses varying from a few mm to cm Clay minerals and carbonate mud are locally replaced by dolomite and microcrystalline silica Lighter laminas appear to be composed of microcrystalline calcite and darker laminas are composed of micro crystalline and rhombohedral dolomite and organic matter Siliciclastic grains ostracod and phosphatic particles are also found in the mud Gomes et al 2020 Spherulites are spherical calcite aggregates with a radial structure that are commonly dolomitized or recrystallized Gomes et al 2020 measured spherulites on thin sections and calculated a diameter range of 0 1 4 mm with a mean of 1 mm and a mode of 0 6 mm Due to the small variance in size the same formation mechanisms are assumed for all examined spherulites A nucleus in the center is rarely identified which may be cryptocrystalline micrite clay minerals or ostracods The orig inal fibrous appearance is mostly preserved but it can be lost due to chalcedony and microquartz replacement The spherulites seem to favor an upward growth but in special cases the spherulites can grow parallel to the bedding Intermediate forms between spherulites and shrubs also exist The term shrub refers to very coarse bladed calcite crystal crusts in a fan like structure that show perpendicular grow along an axis pointing away from the substrate from which they originate Folk et al 1985 Gomes et al 2020 found that the long axis of the shrubs in the Barra Velha Formation is between 0 15 and 6 5 mm They grow in a parallel fashion with distances between individual shrub axes ranging from 0 2 to 4 mm and occasionally contain fine detrital material The shrubs form horizontal layers and can locally form dome like structures Rezende and Pope 2015 Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 Occasionally shrubs can exhibit multiple growth phases resulting in composite shrubs as large as 20 mm action and currents Arienti et al 2018 Artaga o 2018 Ceraldi and Green 2017 Gomes et al 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Sartorato 2018 Tanaka et al 2018 Wright and Barnett 2015 2017 The presence of the mud matrix suggests that transport did not occur Herlinger et al 2017 Spherulites most likely formed at the sediment water interface in an alkaline environment rich in dissolved organic acids Mercedes Martín et al 2016 One possibility could be that the spherulites of the Barra Velha Formation formed around bac terial clumps present in the water column and then slowly settled down until they reached the sediment water interface Gomes et al 2020 where they continued their spherical incremental growth pattern like the mechanism proposed for other alkaline lake systems Mercedes Martín et al 2017 Reworked sediments are found at the paleo highs interfingering with intervals of shrubs and spherulites but also farther from the highs in the more basin dominated areas The reworked sediments are the debris of shrubs and spherulites created during episodes of lower lake levels causing erosion and was transported away from the paleo highs by gravitational currents Away from the paleo highs laminated micrite and Mg rich clays dominate in the paleo lows Due to their small grain size both sedi ments require a low energy environment to settle down below the wave base They are interpreted to have formed in the deeper and undisturbed parts of the lacustrine environment Near to the paleo highs some areas are locally characterized by some amounts of preserved Mg rich clays Protection from wave energy in localized smaller basins paleo lows could have allowed Mg rich clay to accumulate there suggesting that they can still occur at shallow water depths but require a low energy environment 2 3 Tectonic and climatic controlling factors Tectonic and climatic cycles as well as sea level fluctuations are inter related and have a tremendous impact on sediment erosion transport deposition and accommodation space They are the major controlling factors and drivers for the creation of different depositional environments in sedimentary basins Catuneanu et al 2009 Mack 1978 Nichols 2009 Tectonics and eustasy affect the accommodation space of the basin which is the space available for sediments to accu mulate over time Climate on the other hand has a more indirect effect on the accommodation by controlling the sediment available for depo sition For example it limits the amount of sediment that can be trans ported into the basin or the rate of growth of biogenic sediments Other factors such as wave energy or currents are also determined by climate Catuneanu et al 2009 Eustatic sea level fluctuations are controlled by both tectonics and climate on different time scales On the larger strat igraphic orders third stratigraphic order and above the driving factor is tectonic mechanisms such as continental formation and break up or regional plate kinematics Time scales for sea level changes range from 200 to 400 My first stratigraphic order to 1 10 My third stratigraphic order For smaller stratigraphic orders cycles fourth and fifth strati graphic orders global climatic changes e g caused by Milankovitch cycles with duration of 0 01 1 My are the main driving force Catuneanu et al 2009 Miall 2000 Vail et al 1977 The cyclical deposition of the Barra Velha Formation facies described above has been observed and associated to the interplay between tectonic and climatic cycles affecting the Santos basin Arienti et al 2018 Artaga o 2018 Dias 2005 Farias et al 2019 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Sartorato 2018 Wright and Barnett 2015 The basin wide un conformities that bound the Barra Velha Formation at the top Salt base and bottom Pre Alagoas and internally Intra Alagoas represent such interplay and were used to further subdivide the stratigraphic units For example the Intra Alagoas Unconformity divides the Barra Velha For mation in a Lower Barra Velha Formation and an Upper Barra Velha 2 2 Conceptual sedimentological model The relief of the Outer High central part of Santos basin Fig 1 was very similar to what can be seen today on seismic reflection profiles Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 allowing the definition of two distinct types of depositional environments i e paleo highs and adja cent paleo lows that are also supported by lithological information from well data Fig A1a Due to such relief configuration the condi tions for sedimentary deposition differed in terms of bathymetry but also in terms of other sediment control factors such as wave energy The depositional environment of the paleo highs is strongly influ enced by lake level fluctuations and even shows signs of exposure during lake level low stands Gomes et al 2020 The paleo highs are domi nated by the presence of shrubs that grew in an upward vertical di rection from a substratum Basso et al 2020 They are found in their in situ position indicating that they were not transported Shrubs form horizontal layers and locally low domal structures Rezende and Pope 2015 Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 Biological factors may play a role in the initiation of shrub growth invoking growth in a shallow water depth in the range of the photic zone Ceraldi and Green 2017 Gomes et al 2020 Shrubs also require wave energy for their development In the Kwanza basin very similar facies to shrubs have been observed and have been interpreted to have formed positive structures on paleo highs like modern reefs requiring both light and wave energy for their development Saller et al 2016 Spherulites are also present on the paleo highs but they indicate a higher lake level during the time of deposition protected from wave 4

A B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 Fig 2 The forward stratigraphic model FSM based on the concep tual sedimentological model and input data provided realistic maps of the sedimentological facies distribution These were used as an input data for the basin thermal model which provides a detailed prediction of the other parameters that are believed to control silicification over time namely pressure temperature and CO2 concentration in water Collard et al 2023 The simulated facies maps the basin modeling output maps namely that of CO2 distribution together with the transformation ratios of clays to silica defined by means of geochemical modeling see Collard et al 2023 were combined to produce through map based analysis the silicification probability maps Fig 2 These steps are described in detail here below model for each time step at a given interval The result is a highresolution geologic model showing sedimentary distribution and facies architecture The model can be used to quantify sedimentary processes through time for a specific location providing a deeper understanding of geological evolution as was done in this study for the Barra Velha For mation of the Santos Basin whereby the constructed model spatial resolution is 1 km 1 km with a time step of 0 25 million years My Calibration is an essential part of numerical modeling to achieve a realistic result with comparison to available data In this study seismic reflection data interpreted horizons and thickness maps and well data were used to compare and adjust the simulation results An important final step was the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to identify most influential simulation parameters 3 1 Forward stratigraphic modeling FSM 3 1 1 Input data for FSM The main input data for the forward stratigraphic model were sediment types with associated carbonate accumulation curves see Fig 5 lake level variation curve wave energy gravitational sediment transportation paleo bathymetry and subsidence maps Table 1 The five sediment types were defined for the forward stratigraphic model to represent the known dominant BVF facies In a post processing step after the initial simulation facies types were defined based on pro portions of sediment types in the cells Table 3 These facies types were used for calibration with the original well data Forward stratigraphic modeling FSM is a 3D process based approach to modeling geologic processes through time and space Based on physical laws FSM enables to model precise sedimentary facies distribution which is an important input parameter to better constrain basin thermal modeling DionisosFlow a software for stratigraphic forward modeling developed by IFP Energies nouvelles and BeicipFranlab was used in this study Granjeon 1996 Granjeon and Joseph 1999 This software can simulate the production transport and accu mulation of different sediment types on basin scale 10 100 km and over long time intervals 100 Ka 100 Ma It was also used to model sedimentary systems below the fifth order Busson et al 2019 Csato et al 2014 Rabineau et al 2005 accounting for accommodation space variation by a fluctuation of an eustatic sea level curve and or by subsidence It allows to model siliciclastic carbonate and mixed sedi ments as well as the distribution of marine and terrestrial organic matter in different environments ranging from lacustrine and shallow marine to deep marine Andres et al 2008 Bassant and Harris 2008 Bruneau et al 2018 Burgess et al 2006 Claps et al 2009 Granjeon and Jo seph 1999 Hawie et al 2015 Kolodka et al 2016 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Rabineau et al 2005 Seard 2010 Seard et al 2013 Williams et al 2011 Sediment transport is simulated by an empirical diffusion equation that can be driven by gravity and or water Granjeon 1996 Granjeon and Joseph 1999 Deposited sediments can be eroded again e g by wave action Once the process

constructed at the larger basin scale resolution in time and space as mentioned above Detailed smaller scale facies definition e g high resolution well log description microscopic analysis may be less relevant than the dominant end member groups of facies e g muddominated grain dominated in situ sediments This is important for stratigraphic modeling as it allows to focus the simulations on the dominant facies that ultimately create differential stratigraphic patterns The detailed BVF facies described from seven well logs Gomes et al 2020 were regrouped into five dominant facies The end member facies of in situ growing shrub and spherulite each containing more than 90 of shrub or spherulite were grouped into shrubstone and spherulite stone respectively Table 2 All facies containing less than 90 shrub or spherulite and less than 90 fine grain fraction were grouped into the facies Mg rich mudstone Table 2 Mud dominated facies with a significant carbonate content calcite and dolomite were referred to as Fig 5 Normalized carbonate production curves for the 4 sediment types shrub spherulite Mg rich clay and micrite 6

mudstone micrite and reworked facies The Upper BVF is dominated by shrubstone spherulitestone and Mg rich mudstone Mg clay is especially abundant above the Intra Alagoas Unconformity For FSM these dominant facies correspond to a mixture with specific pro portions of sediment types that will be detailed below Section 3 1 1 7 Table 1 List of the principal input parameters and their values used

type 3 1 1 2 Carbonate production accumulation model and sediment trans formation rates Carbonate in situ accumulation rates were calculated based on the age limits and thicknesses of the Upper and Lower BVF They are in the range of 50 m Ma to 80 m Ma for the Lower BVF and increase to 80 m Ma to 120 m Ma in the Upper BVF see Table 1 which is in the same order of magnitude observed in other carbonate systems in the geological record Bosscher and Schlager 1993 Carbonate accu mulation rates are not equivalent to carbonate production rates which can be much higher and in the order of magnitude of 7 9 mm yr of recent coral reefs Kinsey 1985 This is because carbonate deposits can be again eroded and transformed after deposition In this study we focused on adjusting the carbonate accumulation rates of individual sediment types to match the observed thicknesses distribution pat terns and well data of the Lower and Upper BVF For the Lower BVF the following carbonate accumulation rates were used 50 m My for shrub 50 m My for spherulite 60 m My for Mg rich clay 80 m My for micrite For the Upper BVF the following carbonate accumulation rates were used 120 m My for shrub 100 m My for spherulite 80 m My for Mg rich clay 80 m My for micrite Normalized production curves as a function of water depth are shown in Fig 5 Shrub growth was influenced by biological factors indicating for mation in shallow water depths in the photic zone requiring additionally wave energy for their development like modern reefs Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2017 Gomes et al 2020 Therefore the production zone was limited to the first 20m of the water column An additional constraint in form of wave energy was added to the production of shrub and their production only happens in areas where wave energy exceeds 20 kW m Spherulites are found on the palo high in association with shrub and a Mg rich mud matrix which is why the production windows was set between the two other sediment types and below the fair weather wave base The Mg rich clay production window is situated in the sublittoral zone of the lake below the spherulite window They require high pH 9 5 for their formation and elevated methane levels and associated acidity due to organic sediment accumulation would prevent formation at deeper bathymetries Tosca and Wright 2014 Micrite is found mainly in the deeper bathymetries of the lake in the form of finely laminated clays indicating deposition in a calm and un disturbed environment not influenced by waves or storms and repre senting a pelagic background

level curve was constructed from the lithology logs of representative wells for the paleohigh and paleo low areas in the model For each lithology type present in the logs a relative lake level was assigned according to the conceptual depositional model Lithologies associated with a deeper bathymetry during formation were assigned a number close to 1 and lithologies associated with shallower bathymetries were assigned values closer to 0 see Table A1 Consequently a relative lake level variation curve was obtained which depicts the tendencies of relative lake level deepening and shallowing The curve was then readjusted to account for the time required for sediment deposition The depositional time for the different lithologies varies depending on grain size and mode of formation A time

A B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 step of 0 1m was chosen and relative depositional rates were derived for each lithology Table A2 Finally the curve was normalized for a fluctuating lake level between 0 and 50m where 50m is considered the maximum lake level to cover the production window for Mg rich clays Fig A2a 3 1 1 8 Subsidence Subsidence maps were calculated in a twofold step based on seismic horizon data which was considered as hard data and has therefore not been modified First the accumulated sediment thickness was computed by subtracting bottom seismic horizon from top seismic horizon for the Upper BVF and the Lower BVF respectively Then the maps were converted to time unit m My by dividing the thickness maps by their relative deposition time interval Fig A4 Subsidence is assumed linear for each modeled time interval This simplification is minimizing the number of unknow factors and facili tates the correlation with the hard data Calculated values for subsidence in the Lower BVF are 30 m My on the paleo high and 100 150 m My in the basin area Calculated values for subsidence in the Upper BVF are 50 80 m My on the paleo high and 100 250 m My in the basin area Sediment compaction was not considered and no back stripping was applied for the constructions of the incorporated subsidence maps in the stratigraphic model 3 1 1 4 Wave energy Wave energy is a critical factor in the develop ment of shrubstone and reworked facies Saller et al 2016 For com parable wind speeds wave bases are shallower in lakes than in the ocean domain Gilbert 1999 A 1D wave model was chosen in which wave energy decreases from top to bottom and is a function of the bathymetry The wave base was set at 10m and the wave energy is highest between 3 and 13m of bathymetry reaching a peak of 40 kW m at 5m bathymetry Fig A2b 3 1 1 5 Paleo topography Paleo topographic surfaces were used as boundary conditions for the forward stratigraphic simulation They were reconstructed from associated seismic horizons as previous research showed that the Pre Salt field high was also a paleo high throughout the Barra Velha Formation deposition Gomes et al 2020 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Lithology logs were analyzed for the Pre Salt field high and flanks and the paleo bathymetries were deduced Table A2 Using the derived paleo bathymetry information a normalization factor was applied to the seismic horizons to create a paleo topographic surface for each horizon Fig A3 3 1 2 Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of FSM Sensitivity analysis aims to better understand the uncertainty in the output of model simulations and assesses the impacts of various uncer tain input parameters on the modelling results It allows for checking the robustness of the model when uncertainty is introduced and for further understanding the relationship between the input parameters and the output of the model e g unexpected relationships may indicate errors Through such analysis the parameters with the highest impacts on the modelling results can be distinguished and investigated furthermore In this study the software CougarFlow Gervais et al 2018 was used to get a global understanding on the sensitivity of the processes influencing the Mg rich clay distribution Based on the achieved FSM simulation meta models were built for each parameter potentially influencing the simulation result using a Latin Hypercube Design These meta models are in a second step used for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the critical input parameters for the simulation Latin Hypercube Design was chosen instead of performing a Monte Carlo sampling due to its advantages in terms of computation time and cost The whole simulation area was selected as a zone of interest for the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis The average percentage of sediment type Mg rich clay present in each cell of the simulation has been selected as the result of interest An un certainty range 20 of the original simulation parameter was chosen The following 7 parameters were tested for their impact in average Mgrich clay percentage eustasy wave energy subsidence sediment transport carbonate production versus time carbonate production versus depth and sediment transformation rate The sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential parame ters is done by creating a multidimensional response surface in the parameter space which honors the data exactly In a next step a mathematical response surface is generated which is a mathematically reliable representation of all the parameter combinations The fit be tween the multidimensional and the mathematical response surface shows the predictivity of the model and is expressed with a number between 0 and 1 The better the fit and values close to 1 the higher the predictivity and therefore robustness of the model 3 1 1 6 Sediment transport Sediment transport processes and parame ters were defined from an analysis of sedimentary paleoenvironments The paleo high is strongly influenced by lake level fluctuations and signs of exposure during lake level low stands can be found Gomes et al 2020 Shrub on the paleo high grew from a substratum in an upward and vertical direction and forming horizontal layers with domal struc tures Presence of in situ position indicates no transport Basso et al 2020 Rezende and Pope 2015 Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 The association of spherulite with a Mg rich mud matrix also suggests that there was no transport after formation Herlinger et al 2017 Therefore sediment transport is modeled following a linear diffusion gravitational transport law taking into consideration the local gradient of surface elevation Δz The sediment flux in the model Qs is calculated following the equation Qs Kslope Δz The transport coefficient Kslope defines the efficiency of sediment transport and varies with the sediment type The values for the coeffi cient Kslope were assumed very low to prevent the transport of shrub In an iterative approach various order of magnitudes for the transport coefficient values were tested according to a range of values from the literature Bruneau et al 2017 Busson et al 2019 Granjeon 2019 The values for the coefficient Kslope were selected by an iterative approach so that the modeled sediment distribution fits the observed lithofacies data in the wells Table 1 3 1 1 7 Facies definition In a forward stratigraphic model each grid cell contains a mix of the simulated sediment types in percentage which is a function of the parameters described above Sediment per centage is a continuous parameter and in this study we are interested in lithofacies maps Those maps show the distribution of lithofacies throughout the basin and at different ages notably Mg rich mudstone which contribute to the characterization of silicification probability We designed a facies definition matrix which assigns to each cell one discrete facies value based on the percentages of the sediment types present in each cell see Table 3 A value of minimum 30 of the respective sediment type was chosen for the attribution of the lith ofacies class 3 2 Basin thermal modeling Process based forward numerical modeling of the major processes controlling heat and fluid transfer throughout the entire sedimentary basin and throughout its geological history was achieved using a prototype version of TemisFlow developed by IFP Energies nouvelles and Beicip Franlab Schneider et al 2000 This technology has become a standard tool for oil and gas exploration and is now being used to address some of the challenges of the energy transition involving the deep subsurface While stratigraphic modeling is used in this study to provide insight into the distribution of stratigraphic facies basin modeling is used to predict the temporal evolution of other factors 8

prototype module for simulating the transfer of dissolved components and calculating the thermodynamic equilibrium between the aqueous and vapor phase Special attention was given to the fault system which is precisely mapped in the study area and which may be the pathways for the CO2 rich fluids First a basin scale geomodel covering the area of interest is con structed Fig 6 which is calibrated against pressure and temperature data referred to as original model The original model was updated to include results from FSM and is referred to as new model The new model measures 60 km 100 km and is discretized with 250000 cells divided into 21 layers each one corresponding to a depositional event The pre salt formations are discretized by 8 layers corresponding to the following time intervals

described above delineates a subdomain of the new basin model and is hereafter referred to as the FSM sub model 3 2 1 Lithofacies distribution A lithofacies map was assigned to each layer of the model Fig 7 Lithofacies from the original model were not modified outside of the FSM subdomain Five new lithofacies were used to model the spatial distribution of petrophysical properties within the FSM subdomain corresponding to the five simplified facies used in the DionisosFlow model namely spherulitestone shrubstone Mg rich mudstone micrite and reworked facies Faults were added to the model according to available observations in a restricted area around the Pre Salt field reservoir Six other new facies were created to model the cells which are intersected by these faults Spherulitestone fractured Shrubstone fractured Mg richmudstone fractured Mudstone fractured Micrite fractured and Reworked fractured It is very likely that other faults exist in other areas of the basin but no data were available The dominant facies maps of the 8 pre salt layers were then exported from DionisosFlow model and re sampled onto the basin modeling Fig 7 Facies map of the top pre salt layer deposited during the 114 1Myrs 113 Myrs time interval The black dotted line represents the Pre Salt field anticline axis grid The resulting lithofacies maps were completed by assigning the fractured lithofacies to the cells intersected by fault lineaments or above the Outer High regional fault Finally a highly permeable lithofacies referred to as previous boundary in Fig 7 was applied in one cell thick surfaces along the domain lateral boundaries and in all layers of the model to allow the expulsion of compaction fluids without the devel opment of overpressure as observed in the area This method of pre venting overpressure was preferred to a simple hydrostatic boundary condition because it also prevents inflow of external fluid that could disturb the simulated salinity and CO2 concentration fields 3 2 2 Petrophysical properties Assigning petrophysical properties to the different lithofacies of the model was a challenging problem because petrophysical measurements are made on samples that have been altered by diagenesis making them poorly representative of the rock properties before silicification We assigned the petrophysical properties of the two porous sandstones of the original model to all lithofacies of the FSM subdomain to preserve the good calibration of the original model The Schneider model Schneider et al 1996 is used for compaction and the Kozeny Carman model is used for the permeability versus porosity relationship A correction factor of 0 001 was then applied to the permeability of the argillaceous lithofacies Since faults were assumed to be the vectors for the upward migration of CO2 they were modeled as privileged flow paths even though no data is available to confirm this hypothesis except that the CO2 content of the water observed in the Pre Salt field reservoir is indeed high Jia et al 2020 We increased the vertical permeability of the cells intersected by fault lineaments or along the Outer High regional fault by a factor of 10 considering that the damage zone fills 10 of the cell volume with a permeability 100 times higher than in the undamaged rock Fig A5 shows the permeability maps of the pre salt layer at 112 Myrs in the original and in the new model Once completed the geomodel was back stripped automatically according to the porosity versus depth curves assigned to each lithofacies Fig 6 General presentation of the basin model a

state of the art basin thermal modeling whereas modeling the trans port of dissolved salt and CO2 was achieved through an in house pro totype described separately below We applied a multiplication factor to the normalized CO2 production map The CO2 production at the bottom of the sediments was held constant from the initial time of basin formation until 113 106 years the time when rifting has ceased After some trial and error we set the maximum production to 7000 kg m2 106 years to observe a significant CO2 concentration in the Pre Salt field reservoir as is currently observed This CO2 production is the maximum production flux we could find in the literature It was obtained by combining the maximum mantle flux of crustal 3He proposed by Torgersen 1993 and the mantle 3 He CO2 ratio proposed by Marty and Jambon 1987 The final CO2 production flux at the base of the sediments is shown in Fig 6 3 2 3 1 Forward simulations of temperature two phase flow and compaction and the petroleum system Temperature is an important parameter to simulate because it controls CO2 solubility and most geochemical reactions at depth including thermogenic hydrocarbon production It also controls fluid viscosity and fluid density and hence fluid flow For this study we applied a time varying heat flux map at the base of the model extracted from the original model In the latter the thermal model simulated the thermal coupling between the sediments and the crust during the rifting sequence following the McKenzie type crustal model implemented in the TemisFlow advanced basement tool This full thermal model was based on a calibrated map of the crustal stretching factor assumed to prevail during the rifting The two phase fluid flow is simulated using the Visco calculator of TemisFlow with a fully implicit generalized Darcy flow migration scheme The gaseous phase consists of hydrocarbons and CO2 The simulation provides predictions of porosity pressure and saturation of the two phases as well as flow velocity in all cells of the models at the end of each depositional event Flow and compaction are largely controlled by the petrophysical properties assigned to each lithofacies In our simulations compaction is the sole driver of the water flow as the bottom boundary and the lateral boundaries were prescribed as no water flow boundaries The source rock is located below the reservoir layers in layer 2 numbered from bottom to top It is assigned a Type I kerogen and a uniform TOC of 4 A 5 class compositional kinematic scheme is applied 3 2 4 Map based analysis The distributions of Mg rich clay content output of DionisosFlow simulations Fig 8a and the aqueous CO2 concentration that was calculated by TemisFlow were post processed to populate the pre salt reservoir layers with an indicator of the probability that clay has been converted to silica Collard et al 2023 demonstrated that Mg rich clay dissolution and quartz precipitation are directly controlled by aqueous CO2 content with no significant first order effect of pressure and tem perature These authors further quantified the effect of aqueous CO2 concentration and Mg rich clay content on the rate of silicification by means of a dedicated geochemical modeling workflow We have embedded the results of geochemical modeling Collard et al 2023 in our post processing workflow by deriving specific in tervals of CO2 concentration and Mg rich clay content and assigning to each interval the corresponding estimate of the transformation ratio of Mg rich clay after 10 years Table 4 We then used this transformation ratio and the Mg rich clay content to calculate a net transformation ratio NTR which represents the fraction of the total rock matrix that has been converted to silica Since many of the uncertainties discussed below were propagated throughout the workflow we felt that the relative values of the NTR were more meaningful than the absolute values We present the result in a qualitative manner by assigning a silicification probability indicator to each cell according to the following thresholds i Very low probability NTR 1 ii Low probability NTR in the range 1 6 7 iii Medium probability NTR in the range 6 7 13 and iv High probability NTR 13 Thresholds were chosen so that the cumulative area of high silicifi cation probability across the 8 pre salt layer maps is approximatively 10 of the cumulative area of low to high probability and the threshold between low and medium probability was chosen so that the cumulative area of very low probability is approximatively half of the total area 3 2 3 2 Forward simulation of dissolved salt and CO2 A prototype version of the Visco simulator was also used to simulate dissolved salt and CO2 transport and the CO2 equilibrium between the water and gas phases Salt solubility versus temperature is calculated using the poly nomial function proposed by Harvie et al 1984 Thermodynamic pa rameters used to calculate CO2 solubility in brines are taken from Duan and Sun 2003 A uniform salinity at the time of sediment deposition is assumed in all layers of the model The depositional salinity of all layers above the salt layer is assumed to be 35 g l In the salt layer and in the sediments deposited between 117 and 113 106 years the depositional salinity is prescribed to be 220 g l according to the salinity data collected in the reservoir which still shows a very high salinity at pre sent At the base of the model six bottom layers a depositional salinity value of 10 g l is prescribed The CO2 content in the layers at the time of deposition is set to 0 throughout the model The CO2 source is assumed to be located at the base of the model and is constrained by a basal CO2 flux map expressed in kg m2 106 years A realistic scenario would be that the CO2 flux at the base of the sediments is controlled by crustal thickening during the rifting We have developed a mathematical transformation of the crustal thickening map that yields a normalized CO2 production map It is consistent with the global hypothesis that CO2 is produced by the regional Outer High fault and by the magmatic intrusion located beneath the center of the modeled area where β x y represents the beta factor map used in the McKenzie type crustal thermal modeling 2 CO2production x y 4 Results 4 1 Forward stratigraphic modeling 4 1 1 Lower Barra Velha Formation A depositional environment with paleo bathymetries from 20 to 50m around the paleo highs about 70m on the nearby flanks and up to about 200m in the offshore basin areas was configured to enable the model the formation of the extensive lacustrine carbonates of the lower Barra Velha Formation Sedimentation occurred in the early post rift stage of the Santos Basin where subsidence on the paleo highs was up to 30 m Ma and in the offshore area about 100 m Ma reaching locally high values of 150 m Ma Additional accommodation space was generated due to the variation of the eustatic lake level curve which reached a local maximum at about 121 Ma then dropped 40m at 119 Ma before reaching a maximum again at the end of the Lower BVF deposition Best results for thicknesses from well data and seismic horizons as well as facies distribution patterns were obtained with sediment production rate values of 50 m My for spherulite and shrub 60 m My for Mg rich clays and 80 m My for hemipelagic micrite Fig 5 Table 1 Transformation rates for spherulite and shrub into reworked sediment were fixed at 20 m My Wave energy had to exceed 20 kW m for

A B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 which explains the relatively more varying lithological distribution visible on the facies log Shrubstones spherulitestones and reworked facies that were simulated on the paleo high correspond to the main facies types present on the well log well The reworked facies was simulated mainly below the Intra Alagoas Unconformity which is consistent with the log data Besides shrubstones appear to be more dominant than spherulitestones based on modelling an observation that is also confirmed by the log data Figs 4 and 11 The simulation for well C on the paleo flank shows an alternation of Mg rich mudstone and micrite up to the Upper BVF with a maximum of Mg rich mudstone around the Intra Alagoas Unconformity Reworked facies are present at the base of the Lower BVF The top of the Upper Barra Velha Formation is dominated by spherulitestones The simulation results are consistent with the general trend visible in the lithology log of well C which shows a transition from micrite to Mg rich mudstone around the Intra Alagoas Unconformity to an alternation of spherulitestones and shrubstones at the top The lithology log shows many alternations of Mg rich mudstone and micrite with reworked facies that could not be reproduced in the simulation Besides the shrubstone intervals at the top of the BVF could not be reproduced for this well 4 1 4 Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of FSM A total of 30 simulations were run following the Latin hypercube design to parameterize the selected uncertain parameters of the model The calculated mathematical response surface shows a predictivity of 0 967 which is close to 1 and therefore shows high predictivity The average percentage of Mg rich clay for the 30 simulations varies be tween 7 43 and 14 57 Fig 12 shows that four parameters have a significant contribution to the average Mg rich clay percentage in the model contribution 10 the most influential of which is subsidence 50 1 Carbonate production vs water depth 19 1 carbonate production vs time 15 9 and lake level variation curve 11 7 have a significant influence The rest of the parameters tested have a relatively small effect 0 5 Fig 10 Average Mg rich clay content for the Lower a and the Upper Barra Velha Formation b Cross section of the model in E W direction showing the average Mg rich clay content c and facies distribution d vertical exagger ation 10 4 2 Basin thermal modeling The lithofacies distribution of the new model has been modified from the calibrated original model see above therefore we first ensured that the new model remained calibrated by comparing the pressure temperature and hydrocarbon saturation over time of the two models There was no significant difference in these quantities the model re mains hydrostatic and the hydrocarbon filling history of the traps is unchanged Production rates for hemipelagic micrite remained constant at 80 m My Sediment transformation rates and wave energy are identical to the Lower Barra Velha Formation The lake level curve has two minima for the Upper BVF at about 116 My and at 113 5 My decreasing by about 40m each time A maximum is reached at 115 My The boundary between the Lower and Upper BVF is characterized by a Mg rich mudstone interval which is also visible in the well data from the flanks of the paleo highs Fig 11 Modeling shows that the shrub stones and spherulitestones are more abundant during the lake level maximum at about 115 Ma They appear to transgress from the highs onto the flanks and finally into the basin area especially on the east side of the paleo high Mg rich clays are less abundant compared to the Lower Barra Velha Formation but locally reach higher concentrations especially on the eastern flanks of the paleo high with values of up to 67 Fig 10 Thickness calibration around the paleo highs where well data is available shows a mean thickness error of 47m For the entire modeled area the thickness error is 80m Fig A6 4 2 1 Paleo hydrodynamics The general paleo hydrodynamics in the layers of interest is controlled by the impermeable boundaries the upper boundary con sisting of the salt layer and the bottom and lateral surfaces and the quasi hydrostatic pressure at the lateral boundaries which is obtained by imposing a high permeability on a 1 cell layer at the lateral bound aries It follows that the general flow pattern is centripetal and parallel to the stratigraphy Fig 8c with the highest flow velocity in the upper layers as compaction and permeability increase upward The normal to bedding component of the flow velocity is generally much lower but we can observe localized vertical fluid exchange controlled by local permeability heterogeneities Fig 13 Fluid flow velocity is highest immediately after salt deposition with maximum velocities of about 5000 m Myrs in the upper reservoir layer and decreases thereafter After 100 Myrs maximum fluid velocities rarely exceed 50 m Myrs in the area of interest With the new distribution of lithofacies given by the FSM study the increase in permeability along the major faults and the new lateral boundary conditions the paleo hydrodynamics are likely to have been modified from the original model Fig 13 confirms the difference be tween the fluid flow velocity fields of the two models This is further 4 1 3 Comparison of FSM results and well data Two representative wells one located on the paleo high well D and the other one on the paleo flank well C were selected to compare the simulation results with the original facies log from well data Fig 11 An important consideration for calibration is the difference in resolution between the simulation result and the well data The model has a time step of 0 25 My compared to a much finer resolution of the lithology log 12

A B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 distribution It shows that the model is robust as there is minor variation in the average percentage of sediment type Mg rich clay between 7 43 and 14 57 across the study area The result of thickness calibration between the seismic horizon data and the simulation is well achieved in zones with well data around the paleo high ranging from 13 to 47m Fig A6 Mismatches are localized in the Northwest simulation thickness too thin and the Southeast simulation thickness too thick far away from well data in the basin area Getting a better calibration result in those areas was not without losing the thickness calibration in other parts of the model Sensitivity analysis identified subsidence with a contribution of over 50 as the most influential parameter on the percentage of Mg rich clay in the model Fig 12 This parameter comes from the seismic horizons a type of data that already has a higher un certainty in the area The BVF is covered by a 2000 2500m thick evaporite layer Chang et al 1990 Dias 1998 Pereira and Macedo 1990 Low contrast rock densities in the formation plus the coverage by thick evaporites complicate seismic interpretation and time depth con version While the seismic horizons did not affect the primary outcome of this study future work on seismic interpretation and depth migration in the study area could reduce the uncertainty The workflow used in this study differs from most standard basin analyses by first introducing a preliminary stratigraphic forward modeling stage Fig 2 FSM simulates geological processes through time to reconstruct lithology distribution Coupled with basin modeling it has been shown to reduce uncertainties in petrophysical parameter distributions by better constraining lithofacies Barabasch et al 2019 Christ et al 2016 Dubille et al 2017 The FSM approach provided 8 detailed lithology distribution maps for the pre salt formations In particular the spatial distribution of Mgrich clays is an essential element for the understanding of the silicifi cation intervals in this part of the Santos Basin Pereira et al 2023 Coupled with the burial and thermal model the probability of silicifi cation can be predicted Mg rich clays occur predominantly in a ba thymetry window of 20 50m because of the associated carbonate production curve The Mg rich clay production is supposed to cease with increasing bathymetry as it requires a high pH value of 9 5 At deeper bathymetries elevated methane levels and associated acidity due to organic sediment accumulation is supposed to prevent the formation of Mg rich clays Tosca and Wright 2014 Therefore the production curve was adapted to follow this trend This production window results in a widespread Mg rich clay accumulation in the basin but elevated values in proximity to the highs and on the paleo flanks which offered favorable conditions for accumulation below the wave base Fig 10 With the FSM approach and its validation by means of to the calibration at the well locations average Mg rich clay content could be calculated at the basin scale FSM results also provided basin scale spatial distribu tions for other lithologies present in the BVF which constrained the porosity and permeability distributions for the burial thermal model Fig A5 Shrubstones and spherulitestones were assigned a higher permeability increased by a factor of 1000 than micritic and Mg rich mudstones resulting in a contrast in rock properties Compared to the first generation burial thermal model a more differentiated flow ve locity field becomes apparent Fig 13 Areas of shrubstones and spherulitestones act as pathways for CO2 migration from deeper layers along faults and along stratigraphic layers forming chimney and tree like structures Fig 13 The same phenomenon has been observed at the well scale Basso et al 2023 and at the reservoir scale Almeida Carvalho et al 2024 This result highlights the importance of the lithology distribution as one of the key drivers of fluid migration across different observation scales Therefore it is important to include a detailed lithology distribution to correctly predict the silicification probability Around the Pre Salt field anticline FSM predicts a lithology dominated by shrubstones and spherulitestones Figs 9 10 and 13 These act as conduits for CO2 migration and CO2 can rise to the salt base along which it begins to migrate laterally Fig 14 Where the FSM predicts a predominantly micritic lithology such as north of the Pre Salt field anticline low per meabilities act as a seal for CO2 migration resulting in high CO2 con centrations being trapped in the pre salt layers Fig 14 The effect on general hydrodynamics is difficult to measure but is probably of sec ondary importance compared to the role of faults Comparison of the hydrodynamics of the original model with the new model Fig A7 shows that the combined effect of the decrease in permeability in the shale facies and the increase in permeability along faults leads to local differences in CO2 concentration due to flow modifications but the regional trends are preserved 5 2 Quantitative assessment of the dynamics of CO2 migration in the basin Results of this integrated basin modeling workflow not only provided insight into the probability of silicification but also highlighted some interesting features regarding the CO2 system Analysis of the basin simulation results shows that the CO2 can only begin to migrate from the deepest layers when the permeability is sufficient to allow the flow i e in the relatively shallowest parts of the deepest layer Fig 14 In the deepest areas the permeability of the rock is close to the irreducible permeability after salt deposition and is no longer compacting trapping the dissolved and free CO2 in the porosity As the CO2 accumulates over time it forms a gas phase and the overpressure begins to rise but not enough to exceed the capillary pressure of the source rock sitting above the bottom layer Fig A8 Upward migration of CO2 occurs in areas where the basement is shallower making the lowest layers more permeable particularly around the Pre Salt field anticline and the western compartment of the Outer High lineament where faults were modeled by 10 times more permeable facies Fig 14 These areas of relatively higher permeability provide flow paths for the upward migration of gaseous CO2 by buoy ancy and hydrodynamics generated by the low salinity and CO2 rich fluids expelled from the deepest layers by compaction Fig 14 As the deepest fluids flow into the upper pre salt layers they are locally mixed with the fluids in place thus reducing local salinity increasing CO2 solubility and CO2 concentration and ultimately feeding the gaseous phase with CO2 Therefore the uncertainty in predicting the CO2 con centration in the subsalt layer is primarily due to the uncertainty in the sediment thickness which controls the distribution of permeability and rock compactability in the deepest layers and to a lesser extent to the position and permeability of major faults which provide localized flow paths connecting the basement to the upper pre salt layer The sensi tivity of the distribution of CO2 concentration to the geological scenario is illustrated in Fig A7 where a comparison between the two maps of CO2 concentration predicted with the original with no fault and a basic lithological distribution and the updated model at 112 Myrs in the presalt layer The two maps show the same trends with local differences notably sharper concentration peaks in the new model such as the concentration peak located at the northeast end of the Pre Salt field anticline The CO2 production flux map may affect the relative con centration peak at the top of the deepwater inflows but not their loca tion We expect it to play a secondary role in the overall trends of the silicification probability maps obtained in this study This analysis shows that the basin simulation contributes to the workflow mainly by predicting a distribution of the CO2 concentration that is quite robust since it is controlled to the first order by the sediment thickness which shows little uncertainty This conclusion is very specific to the geochemical system considered here where pressure and temperature play only a secondary role The basin simulation also provided insight into the temporal evolu tion of the composition of the non water phase including hydrocarbons and CO2 trapped in the Pre Salt field reservoir CO2 appeared first but very shortly before hydrocarbons Fig A9 This supports the assump tion that the diagenetic episode was very short in time if the arrival of hydrocarbons stopped the process or that diagenesis continued after the 15

A B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 arrival of hydrocarbons possibly with slower kinetics Finally this analysis also showed a slight decrease in the amount of CO2 trapped in the reservoir over time which can be interpreted as a continuous supply of fresh hydrocarbons while the supply of CO2 from the deepest layers has decreased due to reduced compaction and the interruption of CO2 production Our study focusses on an internal source of silica associated to a first phase of silicification and CO2 rich fluid upwelling along deep rooted faults However there are other possible scenarios regarding silicifica tion For example hydrothermal activity can also be a source of silica and the interplay of burial diagenesis and hydrothermal fluids can lead to the precipitation and dissolution of minerals impacting the reservoir quality in the region De Ros 2021 Dissolution of Mg rich clays and silicification could also come from maturation of organic matter which can generate CO2 and organic acids which can in turn also dissolve Mg rich clays Future studies could investigate alternative scenarios regarding the CO2 origin and silica source to calculate silicification probability with our described workflow 5 3 Consequences of the interactions of CO2 fluids and the carbonate host rocks silicification Collard et al 2023 investigated the mechanisms driving the silici fication of continental carbonates using geochemical batch modelling constrained by a large set of samples from the Barra Velha Formation Santos Basin Brazil They evaluated the contribution of different silica sources including the contribution of Mg rich clay alteration to silici fication and the physicochemical conditions that trigger silicification Their models showed that pH is the first order parameter controlling the stability of Mg rich clay pH can be influenced by several processes including local CO2 inputs in sedimentary basins They also showed that the water to rock ratio and secondary mineral formation may constrain the dissolution of Mg rich clay and the precipitation of secondary phases such as quartz dolomite and magnesite by renewing the source of proton more effectively and acting as a sink for Si and Mg which affects the saturation state of the solution The dissolution of carbonates and their cementation or replacement by silica are supposed to be a driving factor on the permeability and porosity High silicification probability can be an indicator for reservoir quality For this reason the understanding of the silicification processes and the modeling of the spatial distribution of silicification probability are of great importance in the characterization of pre salt carbonates The integrated process based modeling workflow presented above provided therefore the two essential input data types for the assessment of silicification probability on the Outer High of the Santos Basin Fig 2 FSM simulated the spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary facies notably the Mg rich clays Basin modeling simulated the temporal evo lution and spatial distribution of controlling factors for silicification notably pressure temperature salinity and CO2 concentration Combining these with the results of process based geochemical modeling Table 4 Collard et al 2023 allowed the computation of Mg rich clay transformation probability across the study area Silicification probability maps were calculated for the 8 pre salt layers Silicification probability appears to be very low in most parts of the Outer High Fig 15 It is higher close to the Pre Salt field anti cline and in the northeast and southeast parts of the Outer High where the CO2 concentration and Mg rich clay content reached sufficient levels to dissolve Mg rich clay and precipitate quartz in the host rocks In more details medium to high silicification probability is observed in a few small spots situated to the east and at the Pre Salt field anticline where it peaks at the northern end of the anticline crest Fig 15 These areas coincide with those showing relatively high Mg rich clay contents Figs 8a and 7 as well as zones of high CO2 concentrations Fig A7 Consequently the produced silicification maps are coherent with the input data and the process based calculations They point out to those areas and depth intervals where the continental carbonate rocks have Fig 15 Silicification probability map calculated for the Upper Barra Velha Formation pre salt layer been silicified and affected by inherent dissolution of remaining car bonates resulting in highly porous and permeable pre salt reservoirs that are produced in the various fields offshore Brazil Quantitative silicification data from the other reservoirs in the study area were not provided so the predicted silicification probability maps cannot be compared with in situ observations An interesting perspective of this study would be a regional analysis of silicification to evaluate the validity of our prediction 6 Conclusions To better understand and predict reservoir quality in the Barra Velha Formation at the larger basin scale we focused our work on the spatial and temporal prediction of the silicification probability due to the interaction between CO2 rich fluids and Mg rich clays For this purpose we have developed an innovative workflow that integrates forward stratigraphic modeling FSM basin thermal modeling and quantitative geochemical modeling FSM simulated with a process based modeling approach the Mg rich clay distribution and associated uncertainties at the time of deposition of the Barra Velha Formation Basin modeling simulated the factors that control the diagenetic reactions responsible for silicification over time namely the CO2 flow salinity thermody namic conditions and fluid composition Geochemical modeling allowed calculation of the Mg rich clay transformation ratio to silica The combination of Mg rich clay distribution diagenetic control factors and chemical kinetics allowed the calculation of silicification probabil ity maps This study explored the scenario of an internal silica source and transformation of Mg rich clays by CO2 rich waters which are expelled from the deepest parts of the Santos Basin via a deep rooted fault system The highest probability of silicification was observed at the northeastern end of the Pre Salt field anticline Other high silicification probabilities were identified above the Outer High lineament and to a lesser extent in the northeast of the study area With respect to reservoir quality it is essential to understand not 16

Aptian chemogenic lacustrine factory Araujo et al 2012 and the Cod o Formation of the Parnaiba Basin by Bahniuk et al 2015 Hunt et al 2019 report biogenic microbialites and breccias deposited in a range of saline to alkaline lake waters from Campos Basin represented by diverse microbial and related features not seen in the BVF and its equivalents PLATFORM SETTING OF THE BARRA VELHA FORMATION The gross depositional setting for the carbonates of the BVF is the subject of debate Based on seismic data a number of authors have interpreted the facies characterizing the BVF and its equivalents as representing deposition on isolated carbonate platforms within relatively deep lacustrine basins with elevations of the platforms of hundreds of metres der Mann Rigg 2012 Buckley et al 2015 Saller et al 2016 Sabato Ceraldi Green 2017 Kattah 2017 Vieira de Luc et al 2017 Ferreira et al 2019 As a result some authors have proposed distributions of key lithofacies based on the view that such facies would be differentiated on shallow platform tops Saller et al 2016 Sabato Ceraldi Green 2017 and even populating reservoir models on that basis de Paula et al 2017 The evidence used to identify the existence of isolated high relief platforms has come from their current structural positions on fault blocks and from clinoformal geometries implying depositional relief While lacustrine carbonate systems are capable of producing small scale platformlike depositional geometries Platt Wright 1991 such as from the Eocene of the Bohai Bay Basin China Liu et al 2020 the relief on such platforms was decametre in scale at best and stratigraphically thick successions are not recorded Shallow water lacustrine carbonates are known to have developed on pre existing structural relief and hence were adjacent to deeper lake waters such as in the Toca of the Congo Basin West Africa for example see Wright 2012 The three basins in which the distinctive facies characterizing the BVF developed are structurally complex with many studies highlighting potential effects that can make interpreting seismic features and tectonic history far from straightforward These include the extension discrepancy and polyphase faulting discussed by Reston 2009 and McDermott Reston 2015 The effects of outer margin 51 collapse Pindell et al 2014 2018 during the late Albian are another consideration and could have triggered deformation affecting the BVF and produced relief on the top of that unit easily misinterpreted for depositional topographic relief Alves et al 2017 record from Santos Basin the effects of inversion when normal faults formed during the syn rift stage were later reactivated as low and high gradient reverse faults and pop up anticlines On some seismic lines inversion structures related to normal faults intersect the base salt and significant erosion took place locally at the top reservoir level above the area where inversion is recorded Karner Gamboa 2007 record faulting and erosion having affected the BVF prior to salt deposition Davison et al 2012 record many small normal fault offsets at the base salt level a small number with offsets of more than 1 km Later rapid salt deposition and movement gravitational gliding caused significant fault reactivation and enhanced structural relief along the base of the salt Davison et al 2012 Alves et al 2017 An additional issue is that volcanics can produce a range of seismic features readily misinterpreted as carbonate in origin such as clinoforms and mounds Wright Barnett 2017 Thus identifying depositional topography in the BVF and its equivalents requires careful screening One approach to this is to apply the methodology and criteria developed for identifying marine isolated carbonate build ups by Burgess et al 2013 Although very little is known about seismic geometries associated with lacustrine carbonates either modern day or in the stratigraphic record if light dependent microbialites were the major sediment producers for the BVF facies the approach by Burgess et al 2013 should be applicable as their focus was largely on the behaviour of tropical phototrophic carbonate factories Those published studies describing isolated platforms in the BVF and its equivalents have not used any such approach in their published interpretations Wright Rodriguez 2018 provide a discussion of these issues in relation to the BVF in Santos Basin Wright Barnett 2017 stressed that no modern lacustrine carbonate systems produce large differentiated platforms but that there are examples of isolated sub lacustrine and subaerial mounds the former at least of seismic scale see below Those authors also discussed issues relating to the apparent presence of clinoforms in Santos Basin which might be used as 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020 International Association of Sedimentologists Sedimentology 69 47 73

52 V P Wright evidence of high relief carbonate margins The main evidence for the absence of any significant relief during deposition of the BVF came from a correlation of shallow water facies for 180 km west to east across Santos Basin using the package of carbonates at the top of the BVF with a distinct gamma log pattern known in the industry as Lula s Fingers This package is 20 8 to 28 5 m thick mean 24 3 m and shows nine gammadefined cycles mean thickness 2 7 m which comprise one or more shallowing upward cyclothems These are well sampled by core and side wall core SWC and their facies are very similar in all wells including a range of unequivocally shallow water facies for example microbial laminites and stromatolites Wright Barnett 2017 Pietzsch et al 2020 This suggests that as these cyclothems were deposited at the same shallow water depths and because such conditions prevailed across the basin by inference there were no deeper off platform areas At present some of these sections are separated by 1 km vertical relief indicating significant post depositional deformation An important issue here is that almost all of the data in the public domain about the BVF and its equivalents comes from wells positioned on what are now structural highs This might suggest that these data sets are skewed to shallow water settings as the correlations by Wright Barnett 2017 show and no data is available from locations off the highs Except for the facies in the Lula s Fingers interval the BVF and its equivalents contain few indicators for water depth other than wave influenced grainstones rudstones and associated facies described below The close stratigraphic association of the more common BVF facies with these grainstones rudstones suggests that water depths were indeed shallow Further support comes from C and O isotope studies using the approach initially developed for East African lakes by Talbot 1990 that indicate the BVF carbonates were deposited in lakes with a large area depth that is shallow Sabato Ceraldi Green 2017 Wright Barnett 2017 Pietzsch et al 2018 2020 and as discussed below strongly affected by evaporation If the BVF facies represent shallow interiors of isolated carbonate platforms adjacent to large and deep water bodies these interiors were isolated hydrologically from the deeper lake system if that ever existed during BVF times If the BVF represents deposition in a shallow lake from C and O stable isotopes and 87Sr 86Sr data from the Campos and Santos basins e g Pietzsch et al 2018 2020 Lima et al 2020 propose that either a single vast lake existed or that the lakes were hydrogeologically connected There are what appear to be high relief isolated mounds in Santos Basin described by Buckley et al 2015 and Barnett et al 2018 with seismic relief of 400 m The mounds are fractured and karstified and are associated with faults forming over fault related antecedent highs The cores of these features consist of in situ shrubs see below with surrounding deposits of grainstones rudstones and less commonly packstones and floatstones composed of reworked shrubs with platy angular and wellrounded intraclasts mainly comprising centimetre to decimetre scale fragments of in situ shrub cementstones Grain size is mainly coarsegrained to very coarse grained to pebble grade with poor to moderate sorting with sub rounded to rounded grains Packages of beds commonly show elevated dips of ca 20 to 40 and show normal grading but mainly lack internal stratification Barnett et al 2018 interpreted these reworked carbonates as colluvial wedges resulting from the subaerial disaggregation of mounds Souza et al 2018 referring to such occurrences cite formation in a low temperature hydrothermal and evaporitic environment linked to ascending Ca Mg Si rich fluids emerging in subaerial and sub lacustrine springs There are some issues arising from the occurrence of these features Firstly they do not appear to show the range of textures and geometries associated with subaerial tufas or travertines and their scale is unlike any such features known today Thick subaerial travertine deposits are known from for example the Ballik area Denizli Basin in West Anatolia Turkey Claes et al 2015 but consist of stacked travertine wedge units with diverse internal facies now well documented from many parts of the world e g Della Porta et al 2017a b High relief isolated lacustrine carbonate build ups are known from modern lakes such as Pyramid Lake in Nevada which can be 100 m high and are now accessible because of lake level falls but formed sub aqueously typically around vents discharging Ca rich waters into carbonate rich lakes These features have complex internal differentiation Della Porta 2015 DeMott et al 2018 seemingly unlike those in Santos Basin which appear in part strongly layered from published seismic images The features described by Barnett et al 2018 were also located near faults strengthening a link to 2020

Aptian chemogenic lacustrine factory sub lacustrine discharge zones These authors proposed a partial analogue with similar mounds from Searles Lake in California described by Guo Chafetz 2012 which also have prominent debris aprons produced by the weathering of tufa deposits These reach heights now of up to 45 m but are mainly 5 to 12 m high The critical issue here is that these features require lake waters of similar depths to their heights which if those in Santos Basin formed in a similar setting requires the lakes to have been 400 m deep although exposed at some later stage Modern lakes in closed basin settings can undergo remarkable fluctuations in lake level such as the Great Salt Lake of Utah and its Pleistocene precursors Benson et al 1992 If the Santos isolated mounds did at least in part form in a deeper lake their textural similarities to those elsewhere in the BVF is surprising If as currently interpreted these textures formed close to wave base and were affected by strong evaporation see below their presence in a deeper setting is unusual Another possibility for the relief of these features seen on seismic could be that what is being seen is stratigraphic not topographic in the sense that they appear to have relief on seismic but developed as stacked composite low relief features that were undergoing contemporaneous erosion around their flanks as reflected in the associated debris deposits COMPOSITION The main components of the BVF have been extensively documented from Santos Basin Terra et al 2010 Wright Barnett 2015 2020 Tanaka et al 2018 Farias et al 2019 Azer edo et al 2021 Barnett et al 2018 in press and equivalents of the BVF from the Campos and Kwanza basins Saller et al 2016 Sabato Ceraldi Green 2017 Herlinger et al 2017 Lima De Ros 2019 As a consequence what follows is only a brief summary The typical appearance in core is of commonly heterogeneous interlayering of centimetre to metre scale in situ and reworked calcite components with Mg silicate clays mainly stevensite and talc with primary and replacement dolomites and silica and porosity What is most striking is that the formations are composed of almost only two basic components millimetre to centimetre sized fascicular structures Fig 3A and B resembling crystal shrubs recorded from travertines Chafetz Guidry 53 1999 producing cementstone textures associated locally with sub millimetre to millimetre thick isopachous laminae of coalesced fibrous calcite and millimetre scale radiating calcite spherulites Fig 3C and D Shrubs Wright Barnett 2020 record from a study of 10 wells in the Lula area a mean bed thickness for the shrub bearing lithologies of 0 51 m with 65 exhibited in situ shrubs and 35 as reworked shrubs The former are identified by having their elongate crystals broadly perpendicular to the substrate although they develop a range of radiating branched and even plumose growth forms The latter consists of a range of fragmented shrub material in rudstone grainstone to wackestone and floatstone textures with or without calcite matrices The in situ shrubs are separated by open pore space or filled with Mg silicates or silica cement or dolomite Where porosity is present in some cases dolomite rhombs occur in the pore spaces like those found closely associated with the in situ spherulites The shrubs grew off isopachous fibrous calcite laminae or grew due to the asymmetrical growth of spherulites Herlinger et al 2017 Lima Ros 2019 or from detrital carbonate material The shrubs exhibit sweeping extinction Fig 3B with a radial fibrous structure and also locally resemble radiaxial fibrous or fascicular optic calcite The calcites have very high densities of very fine fluid inclusions which impart pseudo pleochroism As is the case for the spherulites some recrystallization has taken place but there is no evidence for an aragonite precursor Such branching growth in calcite and crystal splitting reflect kinetic controls Bastianini et al 2019 and are typical of precipitates from highly saturated alkaline solutions e g Rainey Jones 2009 Jones Peng 2012 The range of calcite crystallographic features suggests growth from probably somewhat differing conditions and fluid compositions but at high precipitation rates as noted for radiaxial fibrous and fascicular optic calcites Richter et al 2011 Wright Barnett 2015 proposed an abiotic origin for the shrubs based on the absence of any evidence of a biological including microbial origin In subsequent detailed studies this view has been validated Herlinger et al 2017 Lima Ros 2019 Farias et al 2019 Hosa et al 2020 However Sabato Ceraldi Green 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020 International Association of Sedimentologists Sedimentology 69 47 73

Aptian chemogenic lacustrine factory 2017 tentatively regarded the shrub facies from the BVF equivalents in the Kwanza and South Campos basins as microbialites Studies of travertines with fibrous textures resembling the BVF shrubs by for example Shiraishi et al 2019 and Jones Peng 2012 supported the view that such textures are predominantly abiotic chemogenic in origin While similar textures are seen in modern active travertines isotopic evidence suggests that the calcites were not precipitated from thermal waters Farias et al 2019 Barnett et al 2018 in press Pietzsch et al 2020 although data from the mounded examples described by Barnett et al 2018 is not available The lack of evidence for a microbial origin for the shrubs does not imply that the lake waters were without microbes such as extremophiles but that there is currently no evidence that they played any role in inducing carbonate growth although very subtle influences cannot be completely ruled out but should not simply be assumed The change in growth morphology from spherulites to shrubs was interpreted as indicating that the latter grew unrestricted and without a surrounding gel see below Wright Barnett 2015 Lima Ros 2019 although the presence of Mg silicates between some shrubs and also of dolomites implies that some deposition of gel may have occurred during or after shrub growth Spherulites The spherulites Fig 3C and D are composed of radiating fibrous calcite spheres and reach diameters of up to 15 mm but are more commonly 2 mm They occur in units averaging 0 54 m thick in the Lula area wells studied by Wright Barnett 2020 in three main textural associations Most striking is where the spherulites occur in a clay matrix floatstone with Mgsilicate clay matrices which possess delicate bridge like features composed of magnesite and also numerous dolomite rhombs Fig 3C These same textures occur without the clay matrices which are now represented by porosity Fig 3D These two lithofacies constitute around 60 of spherulite facies Wright Barnett 2020 The remaining 40 consist of fragmented abraded grains in rudstone grainstone packstone to wackestone or floatstone textures commonly associated with fragmented shrubs Wright Barnett 2015 proposed that the spherulites were chemogenic and based on published experimental studies were the product of 55 rapid crystal growth in alkaline solutions highly enriched in Mg and silica in some form of viscous medium which provided the support for the growing spherulites The presence of Mg silicate clay matrices which formed in such fluids originally as gels Tosca Wright 2015 Wright Tosca 2016 supports such a model Spherulites in the BVF in a Mg clay matrix and or associated with bridge like structures have been interpreted as in situ spherulites that is having grown within a precursor matrix Wright Barnett 2020 Further studies on the Aptian spherulitic facies by Herlinger et al 2017 and Lima Ros 2019 from northern Campos Basin and Farias et al 2019 from Santos Basin supported the explanation provided by Wright Barnett 2015 The case for the matrices although now Mg clays having originally been gels is based not only on the experimental work but also on the fact that if the matrices were formed as clays then detrital clay material such as clay clasts should be associated with the reworked carbonates These are effectively never seen with some very rare exceptions As gels the matrices were dispersed during reworking into the water column An analogy can be made here with flint in Cretaceous shelf chalks these chalk muds were commonly syndepositionally reworked but flints originally formed as silica gels are rarely found reworked However the textural relationships and origins of the spherulites have been the subject of considerable debate see review in Wright Barnett 2020 The main disagreements revolve around two issues The first relates to the view that the spherulites did not require a gel in which to form but the case for their growth in a former gel like matrix is addressed in detail using textural evidence in Wright Barnett 2020 The second issue is that many researchers have insisted that the spherulites were microbially nucleated for example MercedesMart ın et al 2017 Rogerson et al 2017 Chafetz et al 2018 Kirkham Tucker 2018 To date no evidence has been presented for any direct microbial influence on these textures from the BVF and its equivalents and Herlinger et al 2017 Lima Ros 2019 and Farias et al 2019 have also emphasized the absence of such evidence The Aptian Cod o Formation of the Parnaiba Basin in north east Brazil contains microbialites and thin units with spherulites associated with Mg clay and dolomite matrices Bahniuk et al 2015 These authors also note the absence of 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020 International Association of Sedimentologists Sedimentology 69 47 73

56 V P Wright any direct evidence of microbial activity associated with the spherulites Bahniuk et al 2015 Microbialites Microbialites stromatolites dendrolites oncoids and microbial laminites occur in the BVF in Santos Basin and are normally only found in the uppermost 20 to 30 m of the formation the Lula s Fingers An abundance of data on the frequency of microbial macrostructures and microstructures from a large set of BVF samples have been provided by Wright Barnett 2015 with microbial macrostructures encountered in never more than 1 of thickness of logged core from the Lula area to microscopic evidence as low as seen in 0 05 of components of thin sections Hasiuk Kaczmarek 2015 presented geochemical analyses from samples from Well BMS 22 Guarani 1ST 3 ESSO 004 SPS in Santos Basin which they interpreted as supporting a microbial influence This author has examined samples from that well and can confirm that microbial textures are common and readily identified making that well highly unusual for the BVF as a whole Muniz Bosence 2015 from a very small data set from the Macabu Formation the BVF equivalent in south Campos Basin record possible microbialites and Hunt et al 2019 also report microbialites from that basin These studies raise the possibility that microbialites may be locally more significant in both Santos and Campos basins The rarity of microbial textures has been discussed by Wright Barnett 2020 and related to the high alkalinity identified by the occurrence of the Mg silicate stevensite because its precipitation requires pH levels as high as 10 to 10 5 Tutolo Tosca 2018 Calcification around what appear to have been cyanobacterial sheaths is seen in the microbialites in the BVF Wright Barnett 2020 but is missing in association with shrubs and spherulites e g Farias et al 2019 The absence of such specific microtextures in modern alkaline lakes is a consequence of high levels of DIC dissolved inorganic carbon Arp et al 2001 What is also striking is the near complete absence of micropeloidal and clotted micrite textures which are so widely documented in known and inferred microbialites Such textures are typically interpreted as resulting from carbonate precipitation triggered by bacterial sulphate reduction but the operation of such processes in inducing carbonate precipitation has been questioned by Meister 2014 especially in alkaline settings see also Gallagher et al 2013 and Meister 2014 A preservational factor needs to be considered as Jones Peng 2012 documenting shrub textures dendrite bushes from geothermal springs in China report that even though microbes and microbial mats were present they had a low preservation potential in association with shrublike growths Those authors cite other examples of this effect from other hot spring deposits Thus the BVF shrubs and spherulites appear to have been chemogenic and abiotic in origin but the lakes may well have contained microbial life evidence of which was not preserved Magnesium silicates However the origin of the Mg silicates needs consideration and Wright 2012 highlighted the role of microbial processes in the formation of Mg silicates in volcanic influenced settings Farias et al 2019 also did not exclude microbial involvement in the formation of Mg silicates in the BVF A number of examples of Mg silicates associated with microbial mats have been reported for example Jones Peng 2012 Burne et al 2014 Pace et al 2016 Zeyen et al 2017 Perri et al 2018 Hubert et al 2018 JaramilloVogel et al 2019 Kremer et al 2019 No microbial textures have been reported associated with the Mg silicates in the BVF Wright Barnett 2020 Tutolo Tosca 2018 have questioned whether microbial processes are capable of producing the large volumes of these Mg silicates seen in the BVF where they can or did once constitute a high proportion of the rock volume especially in the in situ spherulite facies such occurrences can be hundreds of metres thick Associated carbonates As noted above the shrubs and spherulites are commonly not in situ having been reworked The origin of these poorly sorted and rounded grains is unclear but suggests little winnowing or transport and could reflect decomposition by exposure and weathering rather than by waves or currents While the products of this reworking are mainly poorly sorted rudstones to wackestones and floatstones there are two distinct lithologies of particular note laminated calcimudstones and highly texturally mature grainstones and rudstones Wright Barnett 2015 2020 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020 International Association of Sedimentologists Sedimentology 69 47 73

Aptian chemogenic lacustrine factory Laminated calcimudstones composed of a fine detritus of spherulites and shrubs occur in two types The first and more widespread Facies 3a of Wright Barnett 2020 occurs in thin units typically less than 0 3 m of silt grade carbonate or finer with silt sized quartz clays commonly green lacking organic matter finely laminated with rare desiccation cracks locally with abundant carapaces of non marine euryhaline ostracods and phosphatic material including rare complete small fish Polck et al 2020 Much of the phosphatic material consists of millimetrelong millimetre diameter bone like fragments Fig 3E Where not compacted these fragments are filled with carbonate matrix and would have been hollow these being hollow raises the possibility that they were the remains of juvenile birds or pterosaurs Replacive displacive pre compaction centimetre sized silica nodules and layers are common Fig 3E composed mainly of microquartz but with as much as 10 very finely disseminated pyrite commonly as framboids The fine grained nature of this facies suggests likely accumulation in a protected setting or possibly below wave base The presence of desiccation cracks suggests periodic exposure but such features are rare In contrast to the shrub and spherulite bearing facies the presence and local abundance of non marine euryhaline ostracods suggests that the lakes may have become sufficiently less hostile to allow colonization by fresher water inputs The presence of well preserved fish and other vertebrate remains is further support for this interpretation Barnett et al 2018 reported lighter oxygen isotope values for this facies see below further supporting the view of some influx of less evaporated possibly meteoric waters Wright Barnett 2015 proposed that the early silica nodules and sheets represented the interstitial precipitation of silica gels during freshening intervals when the pH of the lake waters decreased as is seen in some modern lakes Renaut 2003 although there is no evidence that this silica in the BVF was associated with microbial mats as has been suggested for some African lakes such as Lake Magadi Behr 2002 The disseminated pyrite and framboids suggest the possibility that bacterial sulphate reduction associated with an increase in organic activity as indicated by ostracods and fish remains may have occurred which could have locally lowered the pH e g Meister 2013 to trigger silica precipitation The other laminated calcimudstone facies Facies 3b of Wright Barnett 2020 has been 57 encountered only rarely to date where most of the data comes from wells that are proximal to structural highs These decametre thick units with varved and graded laminae sub metre thick graded beds resembling turbidites lack ostracods fish remains and early silica nodules but are associated with thin organic laminae This facies likely represents settings affected by sediment gravity flows The highly texturally mature grainstones and rudstones Facies 5 of Wright Barnett 2020 have been documented by Barnett et al 2018 in press and occur in decametre scale units composed of well sorted and well rounded grains of shrubs spherulites intraclasts and in some cases peloids and volcanic fragments These grainstones and rudstones exhibit sharp based decimetre to metre scale fining upward packages with planar low angle stratification and less common cross lamination and planar cross bedding This facies type is associated with marked thinning of the BVF around margins of tilted fault blocks and is interpreted as wave dominated fan delta shoreline deposits by Barnett et al 2018 in press and possibly spits Aspects of the limited range of components There are several outstanding features about the composition of the BVF that require some attempt to explain In most wells there is a paucity or even lack of what one might regard as normal carbonate components such as micrite and sparite In addition considering the abundance of calcite precipitates ooids are extremely rare A likely explanation is that carbonate nucleation was suppressed by kinetic inhibition favouring growth at existing sites Wright Tosca 2016 see also Bastianini et al 2019 The main primary components of the BVF were calcite and Mg silicates especially stevensite a trioctahedral smectite but if evaporation played a critical role in producing some or all of the key components see below the basic question needs to be asked as to why more typical evaporite minerals are missing especially sulphates and chlorides This has been addressed by Wright 2012 citing Cerling 1994 who using data from lakes in the East African Rift emphasized that volcanic catchments are poor in sulphates and chlorides Cerling 1994 proposed that where volcanic terrains predominate calcite tri octahedral smectite analcime and various bicarbonate carbonate minerals would be the main primary 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020

58 V P Wright minerals and the outboard rifted settings of the South Atlantic Cretaceous basins would provide such a setting The absence of sulphates such as gypsum could be explained if the HCO3 of the lake waters was very high relative to Ca2 as may have been the case in the Archean Grotzinger Kasting 1993 and the influence of high pCO2 levels will be discussed later Mercedes Mart ın et al 2019 have suggested that the absence of sulphates and chlorides in the BFV lakes reflects the effects of stationary leakage flux to the underlying aquifers while the model proposed by Farias et al 2019 fig 18 of seawater seepage would have produced sulphates and chlorides in the BVF lakes Finally siliciclastic material is uncommon see also Gomes et al 2020 suggesting that the likelihood of any sediment from the adjacent continents was trapped before reaching the lakes Volcanic clasts are present in the wellsorted grainstone facies Barnett et al 2018 Diagenesis The diagenesis of the BVF type facies has been discussed in general terms by Tosca Wright 2015 who suggested that much of the diagenesis could relate to the decay of stevensite In Santos Basin a prominent phase of later stage carbonate dissolution took place enhancing porosity and permeability in the reservoirs after several phases of replacement and cementation by silica and dolomite A contributor to this dissolution might have been the decay of the Mgsilicates which can result in the release of hydrogen ions Tosca Wright 2015 The role of the salt cover promoting geothermal convection during and after salt deposition has been investigated by Jones Xiao 2013 using reactive transport modelling raising the possibility that some of the dissolution could have been driven by such convection Detailed studies by Herlinger et al 2017 Vieira de Luc et al 2017 Tritlla et al 2018 Lima De Ros 2019 and Lima et al 2020 have emphasized the extensive hydrothermal overprint seen in the Campos Basin relative to that in the Santos Basin Saller et al 2016 and Teboul et al 2017 have also assessed the role of such effects in the Kwanza Basin Classifying the Barra Velha rock types Providing a robust classification for these carbonates presents several problems As discussed by Wright Barnett 2020 the growth of the spherulites within a Mg silicate matrix see also Herlinger et al 2017 Lima De Ros 2019 creates an unusual type of texture which after the congruent dissolution of the Mg silicate of the matrix Tosca Wright 2015 leaves what apparently could be described as a porous grainstone or even boundstone To address some of these terminological problems Wright Barnett 2020 have proposed a simple classification that includes consideration of the porosity while Gomes et al 2020 have offered a more detailed system and also discuss non carbonate detrital components Azer edo et al 2021 also provide another approach to classifying the textures in the BVF CYCLICITY AND DEPOSITONAL SETTING As stated earlier the distinctive suite of lithofacies characterizing the BVF and its equivalents have been identified in Santos Campos and Kwanza basins Besides the lack of any analogue for this scale of chemical sedimentation the lack of sedimentary indicators of water depth has hampered initial attempts to define the depositional setting A critical step in interpreting the BVF came with the discovery of cyclothems in some wells Wright Barnett 2015 Figs 4 and 5 These authors noted a statistically tested pattern of repetition of three lithologies in metre scale units ostracod bearing laminites facies 3 of Wright Barnett 2015 overlain by in situ spherulite facies 2 overlain by in situ shrubs facies 1 Wright Barnett 2015 proposed that the cyclothems likely represented flooding and evaporation cycles Initially an influx of water probably as run off deepened the lakes to below wave base allowing fine grained carbonate to accumulate It is important to note that wave base in lakes is commonly shallower than in marine systems because of the reduced fetch This influx also lowered the alkalinity salinity sufficiently for ostracods and vertebrates to colonize the lakes these were likely to have been introduced from more permanent water bodies such as nearby streams or other lakes The reduced alkalinity triggered silica precipitation see above The overlying spherulite bearing units were first deposited as Mg silicate gels Tosca Wright 2015 Wright Tosca 2016 requiring a shift to highly alkaline waters with 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020 International Association of Sedimentologists Sedimentology 69 47 73

60 V P Wright pH of 10 or above The spherulites Wright Barnett 2015 proposed grew in this gel and in many cases seeded the shrubs in the overlying shrub layer see also Herlinger et al 2017 Lima De Ros 2019 Farias et al 2019 Most gels would likely have been deposited and accumulated below wave base but were also likely to have been periodically reworked At some stage gel precipitation stopped or decreased possibly because of Mg depletion or changed pH levels Wright Barnett 2015 Many of the in situ shrubs have open porosity but as noted above there is evidence that some shrubs likely had Mgclay matrices Wright Barnett 2015 An explanation could be that during the growth of the shrubs any gel material would have been removed by wave action as a result of progressive shallowing Finally in the upper part of the cyclothems shrub growth also ceased This could have been triggered by several mechanisms such as decreases in CO2 content of groundwaters e g Jones Peng 2012 In some cyclothems the shrub units are overlain seemingly non erosively by centimetre thick well sorted grainstones composed of shrub and spherulite debris then sharply overlain by laminites Support for this evaporation model came from thermodynamic modelling Wright Tosca 2016 which indicated that the progression from Mg silicate formation to calcite precipitation could result from concentration by evaporation Barnett et al 2018 in press have provided C and O stable isotope profiles for the cyclothems Fig 5 which indicate a progressive enrichment in C13 and O18 during the cyclothem commensurate with an evaporation trend If as this data suggests the carbonate laminites have lighter values than those from the spherulites or shrubs which contain fine fragments of these grain types some lighter carbon was added which might imply that carbonate was precipitated during that freshening phase Pietzsch et al 2020 from a single well data set from Santos Basin note a lack of direct correspondence between lithofacies and isotopic composition but suggest that evaporative conditions prevailed including the suggestion that inflow waters became enriched in d13C due to evaporation One problem with this evaporative model relates to the known distribution of shrub dominated facies If the shrub facies represents the more evaporative phase of the lake it should based on existing models for the distribution of lake evaporites for example Renaut Gierlowski Kordesch 2010 be limited to those parts of the system where more evaporated waters would have pooled that is in areas with lower topographies hence the bulls eye model for lake evaporite distribution However shrub facies are often best developed in more up dip areas for example Barnett et al in press fig 12 Figure 6 is an attempt to explain this apparent anomaly by considering also the effects of changing water depth and wave action as lake waters fell However this model might also produce shrubs with different C and O isotopic values having begun forming during different stages of evaporation or suggest that individual shrubs might also show such changes If the shrub facies represented the peak of evaporation it is noteworthy that such units from this author s experience do not display evidence of erosion or exposure but Gomes et al 2020 note that a key feature of the tops of these cyclothems are irregular surfaces which may or may not have been subaerially exposed Fig 6 A model for the development of cyclothems in the Bara Velha Formation Stage 1 filling of the lake by waters of reduced alkalinity salinity introducing conditions conducive to euryhaline ostracods and fish The lowering of the pH triggered precipitation of interstitial silica gels which later formed silica nodules The lighter oxygen isotope values in this unit suggest precipitation of some calcite from these less evaporated waters as compared with the values found in the spherulites and shrubs The accumulation of fine grained carbonates implies deposition in a lower energy setting probably below wave base Earlier deposits were reworked in shallower areas along wave dominated shorelines Stage 2 represents the point when evaporation triggered the formation and deposition of Mg silicate gels which are assumed to have been deposited below wave base During the contraction of the lake it is assumed that wave base may also have been shallower as fetch decreased Stage 3 the precipitation of calcite as spherulites within the gels below wave base and locally updip as shrubs where gels were not accumulating or had been removed by falling wave base This is based on the observations that shrub facies are better developed with commonly larger shrubs in updip areas near minor palaeo topographic highs Stage 4 gel deposition may have ceased and spherulite growth reached the sediment water interface allowing shrubs to grow further shrub growth took place in shallower settings Later local progradation of shoreline grainstones covered the shrubs capping the cyclothems 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020 International Association of Sedimentologists Sedimentology 69 47 73

62 V P Wright Azer edo et al 2021 describe the effects of early dissolution on the shrub facies from the BVF possibly linked to their disintegration which might support the view that this shrub phase terminates each evaporation cycle There have been other explanations for the spherulite to shrub change besides evaporation For example Tosca et al 2018 suggested that the spherulite to shrub transition could have arisen due to water column stratification triggered perhaps through freshwater influx to a dense saline water body because they considered that the spherulites required higher states of saturation than shrub growth based on the effects of diffusive fluxes and nucleation rates on crystal growth The role of stratification and its breakdown by mixing and upwelling has been invoked for large scale chemogenic precipitation in Archean to Palaeoproterozoic ocean basins by Grotzinger Knoll 1995 The distribution of the shrubs might be better explained if they formed during periods of rising lake level and Gomes et al 2020 have suggested that wetter periods in the basins with rising or higher lake would have reduced alkalinity and favoured shrub formation This does not explain the isotopic data shown by Barnett et al 2018 in press Gomes et al 2020 raise another important issue in proposing that besides the commonly identified trend for an upward increase in shrubs Wright Barnett 2015 Farias et al 2019 Lima De Ros 2019 they also identified an upward increasing spherulite trend These authors have also incorporated changes in the detrital content and have offered several possible scenarios to explain facies changes humid to arid trend invoking the evaporative model upward increase in shrubs semi arid arid model whereby the shrubs formed during a less evaporitic phase followed by further evaporation by spherulites upward increasing spherulite trend and lastly a constant lake level model whereby changes such as those seen in the main components were the result of changes in aeolian fluvial detrital input pH and lake stratification induced by climate change The second model as noted by Gomes et al 2020 is related to that proposed by Farias et al 2019 from a study of a small 50 m data set from one Santos Basin well SB 2 These authors suggested that the laminite facies formed during a flooding stage followed by evaporation resulting in shrub growth and Mgsilicate precipitation Further evaporation led to complete desiccation Farias et al 2019 fig 14 and the growth of displacive spherulites and apparently halite precipitation However this mechanism does not explain the widely reported fact that many shrubs nucleated off spherulites or the lack of desiccation features in the spherulite facies and that the calcite pseudomorphs after halite reported by these authors appear to be dolomite compare fig 13 of Farias et al 2019 with those of similar textures described as dolomite in Saller et al 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 Lima De Ros 2019 Wright Barnett 2020 Gomes et al 2020 Gomes et al 2020 reinforce the point inherent in the application of an evaporation driven model Wright Barnett 2015 that the spherulites with Mg silicates formed during particular stages of lake development This raises a conceptual problem if one interprets them as contemporaneous as is implied in the models presented by Saller et al 2016 de Paula Faria et al 2017 and Sabato Ceraldi Green 2017 Tanaka et al 2018 also offer a facies model that identifies the shrub facies as stromatolites which formed in shallower settings than spherulites However these authors relate the laminite facies to the shallowest settings and make no reference to its biota This model is based on the brief interpretations provided in de Paula et al 2017 Modern closed system lakes such as that envisaged for the BVF facies have three potential water sources run off direct precipitation and groundwater recharge The importance of these inputs varies between different lakes and also with time related to climate changes The deposition of the laminites Facies 3 of Wright Barnett 2015 suggests that some local run off took place bringing in little non carbonate sediment but able to dilute the lake waters and introduce vertebrates and ostracods As regards evidence for large scale groundwater injections to date no clear examples of vents have been described from the BVF although in Campos Basin some seismic features including what appear to be isolated mound like build ups in the earlier rift stage have been interpreted as hydrothermal vent complexes by Alvarenga et al 2016 and the isolated high relief mounds in Santos Basin described by Buckley et al 2015 and Barnett et al 2018 discussed earlier might be related to sub lacustrine vents However in modern lakes groundwater input can be significant such as in some modern rift lakes such as Nasikie Engida see above and Farias et al 2019 have used clumped isotope 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020

Aptian chemogenic lacustrine factory analyses to suggest that the BVF carbonates recorded in Well SB 2 formed in the range 46 to 73 C so are likely the products of thermal springs Pietzsch et al 2020 concluded using standard C and O isotopic data from the BVF that the isotopic signal for the BVF carbonates was from evaporation of lake waters that had undergone long residence times If the carbonate and silica charged fluids had been sourced via thermal vents those waters were likely not precipitating near the vents Mercedes Mart ın et al 2019 have argued that the evaporation model proposed by Wright Tosca 2016 based on the cyclothems described by Wright Barnett 2015 could not be produced simply by evaporation from a single freshening evaporite cycle Those authors used data from Lake Baringo to show that 25 to 50 fluctuations would be required to produce the cycles While suggesting that such metre scale cyclothems reflected evaporation as supported by the isotope data in Barnett et al 2018 in press Wright Tosca 2016 did not imply that the cycles were the product of a single event Here an analogy can be made with suggesting that a peritidal carbonate cyclothem represents the product of one tide However Wright Tosca 2016 did not provide an explanation as to the hydrological setting that could generate such metre thick cyclothems which apparently indicate a simple if prolonged evaporation trend Mercedes Mart ın et al 2019 suggested that the facies cyclicity recognized in BVF largely reflects temporal fluctuations in the type of waters sourcing the lake and in the degree of leakage to aquifers rather than variations in the lake water concentration factor due to evaporation If groundwater were a major source of the lake water thermal or not what could be being reflected in the cyclothems is initially a freshening deepening phase of the BVF lakes likely a result of input from run off introducing fish and ostracods from streams or other refugia followed by the increasing effect of water derived from groundwater input plus evaporation This could be readily tested by analysing the 87 Sr 86Sr ratio of each carbonate phase to detect changes in the provenance Intriguing as these important cyclothems are they are not the dominant features of the BVF which consists of a highly heterogeneous mix of in situ and reworked components often in poorly rounded and sorted grain wackestone textures with ill defined units lacking evidence of exposure and diagnostic sedimentary 63 structures except for the mature grainstones interpreted as fan deltas and spit deposits as documented by Barnett et al 2018 in press If these in situ and reworked lithofacies are reflecting formation under different water depths with or without changes driven by evaporation they are indicating a highly dynamic system This is not unexpected in shallow closed lake systems where water depth changes over geologically short time intervals can range from decametres or more over hundreds of years to metres on a decadal scale or even less These changes reflect fluctuations in rainfall snow melt although not in the case of the BVF and hence run off or groundwater discharge evaporation rates and of changes in the natural connections between nearby lake segments Metre scale fluctuations are commonly encountered around lakes due to variations in wind direction The Pleistocene to present day history of the Great Salt Lake in Utah being such an example of the remarkable changes that can occur in water depths at different scales Gwynn 1998 The variability in styles of lithofacies ordering in the BVF as shown by Wright Barnett 2015 Gomes et al 2020 and Azer edo et al 2021 and the general heterogeneity is likely an indicator of such restricted conditions and of the interplay of minor topographic variations with complex hydrological and physical factors including stratification It is clear that the origins of the BVF facies are not the subject of universal agreement whether in relation to the sources of their components or to the gross depositional environment as well as the hydrological implications of the cyclothems In broadest terms two somewhat contradictory models can be invoked Fig 7 the deep lake model based mainly on seismic facies see above and the shallow lake model based on facies analysis geochemical evidence C and O isotopes and correlation studies The task of deciding which if any model works and indeed whether that model would be expected to work over such a huge area is hampered by the lack of any modern or ancient analogue including seismic analogues for possible large lacustrine buildups the paucity of depth indicators and the biased nature of the data coming from structural highs let alone the structural complexity of these basins However there has been an imperative for such models coming from the exploration for oil in these basins Whatever large scale model is invoked the current

Aptian chemogenic lacustrine factory was overwhelmingly abiotic that is chemogenic If extremophiles were present as seems likely even in such alkaline conditions the evidence for their involvement direct or indirect in carbonate precipitation is lacking and no matter how topical it is to invoke many carbonate features as the product of microbial processes or the influence of microbial substrates such as extracellular polymeric substances EPS any evidence based interpretation must currently favour an abiotic origin This makes the vast BVF and its equivalents a somewhat rare almost unique carbonate factory in Earth history and certainly in the Phanerozoic DISCUSSION THE BVF FACTORY The early Aptian Albian Cretaceous is regarded as an interval when high rates of volcanic CO2 in the atmosphere led via high rates of silicate weathering to high rates of shallow water carbonate production in the oceans Pohl et al 2020 However the lakes which produced the BVF and its equivalents were not linked to the Aptian oceans If such enhanced weathering from elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 had supplied the BVF factory the limited range of precipitates suggests a predominantly basic igneous source area yet little detrital material from such a source or any major non carbonate source entered the deposystem therefore subaerial weathering seems an unlikely process generating the chemistry of the lakes If a consensus exists in the studies on this chemistry it is that these lakes were at times hyper alkaline with pH of 10 or even above This alkalinity requires explanation an issue in other ancient hyper alkaline lake systems as noted by Lowenstein et al 2017 who identified several possible mechanisms whereby hyper alkalinity could arise Periods of high atmospheric CO2 levels triggering accelerated weathering could provide the alkalinity as noted by Farias et al 2019 potentially enhanced by the sub sea level elevation of the lake basins Magmatic activity introducing alkaline Na HCO3 rich hydrothermal waters is another mechanism and operates within basins such as Lake Magadi Kenya or at distance such as Searles Lake California Lowenstein et al 2016 Lowenstein et al 2017 also noted that high levels of organic decay in lakes could provide a source for CO2 related alkalinity but adding that such organic activity in modern lakes 65 had not created hyper alkalinity In fact high input of CO2 producing high levels of dissolved inorganic carbon has been invoked more recently as potentially promoting high organic productivity carbonate formation alkalinity and the production of Mg smectites in some lakes Milesi et al 2019 2020 Milesi et al 2019 2020 and Wright Barnett 2020 suggested that inputs of magmatic CO2 into the lakes represented by the BVF carbonates could have influenced carbonate and non carbonate deposition by creating extreme carbonate and bicarbonate alkalinities High alkalinities are common in evaporitic lakes where magmatic CO2 input is high Pecoraino et al 2015 Carbon dioxide is present in these South Atlantic basins of Brazil and in one field CO2 was found to be up to 80 in the gas cap Gamboa et al 2019 The bulk of the CO2 in these Atlantic margin basins of Brazil has been shown to be of mantle origin e g Santos et al 2012 and that wells located near major intracrustal intrusions contain the highest amount of CO2 which has been interpreted as likely sourced from the mantle during late Cretaceous and early Eocene times Gamboa et al 2019 The volcanic activity that was associated with the deposition of the BVF and its equivalents Szatmari Milani 2016 would have likely provided an additional source for CO2 and carbonate alkalinity Lima et al 2020 have discussed the possibility that CO2 could have been supplied from the upper mantle or serpentinization Szatmari Milani 2016 while suggesting that leaching by phreatic and hydrothermal waters and erosion of flood basalts supplied Ca2 Mg2 and SiO2 for the BVF facies identified mantle CO2 released later in the Cretaceous and Eocene as the cause of hypogenic leaching to produce reservoir quality However CO2 from the mantle was likely actively entering the BVF lakes and also introducing leachate as bicarbonate from underlying units during formation of the BVF Pietzsch et al 2020 discuss in detail the isotopic fractionation composition trends and origins of C and CO2 in the BVF including a mantle origin These authors note that in the BFV lakes equilibrium took place between lake water DIC reservoir and atmospheric CO2 that required long water residence times coincident with evaporitic shallow lake waters Studies of the active CO2 rich Lake Dziani Dzaha Mayotte Indian Ocean Milesi et al 2019 2020 have shown that magmatic CO2 provides a large contribution to the dissolved organic carbon in the 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020 International Association of Sedimentologists Sedimentology 69 47 73

66 V P Wright lake promoting primary productivity high alkalinities carbonate formation and the formation of Mg silicates albeit on a smaller scale than the BVF lakes There is a case that the alkalinity in the BVF lakes was at least influenced by magmatic and mantle CO2 with that CO2 both contributing directly to the lake waters and also as an agent for leaching a mafic rich source to provide the elemental suite required for the mineralogy of the BVF As stated above the BVF lakes lacked non carbonate terrigenous input other than minor amounts of silicates which suggests that subaerial weathering was not the source of the lake chemistry Here 87Sr 86Sr data provides insights into the provenance of that chemistry Pietzsch et al 2018 Farias et al 2019 and Obermaier et al 2019 provide 87Sr 86Sr data from carbonates that shows values significantly higher more radiogenic than Cretaceous marine values The more radiogenic values in the BVF preclude either the involvement of a mantle or oceanic basalt source and that serpentinization was likely not involved in sourcing the BVF carbonates Because the 87Sr 86Sr ratios are too radiogenic compared with continental flood basalts in the region Pietzsch et al 2018 suggest that felsic rocks from the basement and or alluvial material derived from it were likely also contributing ions As Pietzsch et al 2018 acknowledge the lack of significant detrital sediment in the BVF suggests that direct input from erosion and surface transport from local catchments and rivers seems unlikely whereas the radiogenic values could reflect waters that had long residence times in acidic bedrock aquifers as noted by Ojiambo et al 2003 from east Africa These authors present a model using mass balance calculations to show that a felsic source had likely contributed with fluxes one to two and up to four orders of magnitude higher than the mafic source This would likely require sourcing from the Precambrian basement Tutolo Tosca 2018 have suggested that waters with high concentrations of silica and alkali cations typical of intermediate to felsic rocks such as Na and K would be needed to produce the Barra Velha mineral suite However Lima et al 2020 raise the problem that invoking a felsic source such as the underlying granitic gneissic basement would not provide a suitable source for the abundant Mg and Ca in the BVF and its equivalents Pietzsch et al 2018 also identify a trend towards more radiogenic values from the Jiqui a to Alagoas stages Itapema to BVF while Obermaier et al 2019 report a clear shift to more radiogenic values across the pre Alagoas unconformity and that the overlying evaporites of the Ariri Formation indicate a trend to more marine values Lima et al 2020 provide a compilation of 87Sr 86Sr data from Campos and Santos basins that also shows the trend towards more radiogenic values into the Barra Velha and Macabu formations This more radiogenic signature in the BVF relative to the Itapema contrasts with the interpretation by Farias et al 2019 that the BVF represents an initial transitional stage ending with the deposition of halite and bittern salts of the marine related Ariri Formation Lima et al 2020 report that as isotopic data from different studies were similar over a regional scale in Campos and Santos basins this raises the possibility that the BVF represents either single vast lake or lakes that were hydrogeologically connected The possibility of some involvement of serpentinization of exhumed mantle requires some discussion because some travertine carbonates are associated with exposed ophiolite complexes and serpentinization e g Leleu et al 2016 Pinto et al 2017 have asked whether the Ca and Mg necessary to build the Aptian carbonates in the region were related to fluids derived from serpentinization Zal an et al 2011 identified an extensive zone of exhumed mantle in Santos Campos and Esp ırito Santo basins and proposed that serpentinization had taken place but others have questioned the exhumation of the mantle in the region Kumar et al 2012 Evain et al 2015 Pindell et al 2018 fig 6 implies that exhumation occurred syn salt deposition and not before The 87Sr 86Sr ratios of the BVF carbonates do not indicate a mantle or oceanic basalt source but Lima et al 2020 have invoked the possibility of some involvement of fluids related to serpentinization to explain the lower 87Sr 86Sr ratios observed in the later hydrothermal diagenetic phases compared with those of the primary carbonates in the BVF facies in Campos Basin On an even larger scale the relationship of the BVF lake chemistry to changes in global CO2 and OAE 1a Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a has also been discussed Tedeschi et al 2017 Pietzsch et al 2020 and the issue arises as to whether the BVF lakes were passive witnesses to that event or that magmatic mantle CO2 and its release from the formation of the BVF carbonates 2020 The Authors Sedimentology 2020 International

salt basin Scotchman et al 2010 The Santos Basin contains a greater extent of thick evaporite deposits than the Campos Basin to the north Davison 2007 The evaporite sequence is of fundamental importance to the active petroleum system not only in terms of providing a regional seal the thermal conductivity of the evaporites reduces the temperature of the deeply buried pre salt section preventing overmaturity of the source rock Exploration in the pre salt section of the Santos Basin has centred on the Sa o Paulo Plateau Fig 1 In particular exploration and production focus on the Outer High Figs 1 2 which is also referred to as the Santos External High Carminatti et al 2008 Gomes et al 2013 or the Alto Externo Mohriak et al 2009 This basement high is defined by mapping a regionally correlatable seismic horizon that corresponds to the unconformity at the base of the evaporite sequence which largely reflects Aptian palaeotopography Gomes et al 2013 The Sa o Paulo Plateau is believed to result from failed attempts to propagate seafloor spreading north of the Florianopolis Fracture Zone evidenced by the interpreted presence of proto oceanic crust in the southern part of the Santos Basin west of the southern part of the Sa o Paulo Plateau Scotchman et al 2010 Gomes et al 2013 Subsequent initiation of seafloor spreading further to the east left the Sa o Paolo Plateau as a segment of thinned continental crust still attached to the South American margin The Outer High of the Santos Basin is an uplifted basement structure that records a transition from early volcaniclastic deposition to almost continuous carbonate deposition during the Barremian and Aptian It also marks a period of thermal subsidence or sag during the transition from rift to drift tectonics as seafloor spreading commenced in the mid Atlantic Liro Dawson 2000 The distal location and pronounced elevation of the Outer High resulted in a clastic starved environment in which carbonate deposition could flourish Moreira et al 2007 Gomes et al 2013 The older carbonates in the pre salt section are highly fossiliferous lacustrine limestones with abundant coquina beds similar in part to those described from the neighbouring Campos Basin Carvalho et al 2000 Muniz Bosence this volume in press The sag phase deposits are interpreted to have formed in a non marine depositional environment of increasing salinity although the exact mechanisms involved in their formation are debated Rezende Pope 2015 Wright Barnett 2015 Subsequently an increasingly saline lacustrine environment developed culminating in the deposition of the overlying Albian evaporite sequence Davison 2007 The exclusively continental or shallow water deposits found within the rift and sag

successions and sheared Precambrian rocks with significant intrusive rocks of Archean and Proterozoic age This mobile belt basement forms in a weaker lower crust compared with cratonic areas to the

orientation of this ENE WSW Precambrian fabric contrasts with the east west orientation of extension during the Mesozoic Meisling et al 2001 resulting in oblique rifting of the margin The synrift period is characterized by basement involved normal faulting accommodating the regional mechanical subsidence related to continental breakup Karner 2000 The first stage of rifting corresponds to a period of volcanism growth faulting and subsequent sedimentary infill of the newly formed sedimentary basin Figs 3 4 This phase is characterized by synthetic and antithetic faults across the Santos Basin with variation in the thicknesses of sedimentary packages across the Outer High suggesting that the structures on the SLH began to form at this time A thick wedge of sediment can be seen basinward of the bounding master fault of the SLH Fig 5a in addition to the uplift and rotation of the downthrown fault block This creates a series of smaller basement cored structural highs to the east of the SLH such as the Peroba High Fig 2 The geometries observed in the hanging wall growth wedge Fig 5a suggest that uplift of the SLH probably began during the synrift phase the growth wedge also shows that the relative subsidence of the hanging wall continued during the thermal subsidence phase On the SLH itself the upper synrift deposits of the Barra Velha Fm tend to show a less prominent wedging geometry than the lower synrift Fig 4 This may represent differences in the rate of fault movement that consequently created accommodation space it may also signify an increase in the rate of sedimentation in the latter stages of synrift carbonate accumulation Faulting on the SLH consists of both synthetic and antithetic faulting relative to the eastern master fault hinge zone whereas the Tupi sub high to the north is segmented only by synthetic faults Gomes et al 2009 The Santos Basin passive margin experienced intrusive and extrusive volcanism during the rift and drift

then enters a transitional phase or po s rifte Moreira et al 2007 after rifting but before the drift phase It is during this transitional phase that two of the most important lithologies within the hydrocarbon system are deposited the non marine carbonate reservoirs of the Barra Velha Fm the Sag Sequence of Carminatti et al 2009 and the thick overlying evaporite seal of the Ariri Fm Fig 3 These two sequences are separated by a regional unconformity that can be mapped at the base of the salt Karner Gamboa 2007 The Santos Basin is the widest salt basin in the South Atlantic and the Outer High is estimated to have been at least 200 km away from both the African and the Brazilian hinge lines before continental breakup Gomes et al 2013 The anomalous width of the salt basin here may be the result of a ridge jump event early in its evolution Szatmari et al 1996 The arid Aptian climate resulted in a series of elongated salt basins separated along the margin by igneous intrusions and volcanic massifs Mohriak et al 2008 The periodic influx of continental and marine waters into the basin resulted in the deposition of an evaporite sequence at least 1 km thick possibly reaching 2 km in the main salt depocentres created by thermal subsidence Szatmari et al 1996 Davison 2007 Salt flowed basinward on a massive scale in the 10 myr following deposition as the basin tilted towards the east resulting in virtually zero thicknesses along the inner basin margin and an inflated 2000 4000 m on the outer margins In the case of the Santos Basin the Florianopolis High Fig 1 isolates the basin from the fully marine waters of the Pelotas Basin to the south resulting in a very different evolutionary history However the structural and stratigraphic history of the Campos Basin in the north has similarities to that of the Santos Basin Mohriak Fainstein 2012 even though the Santos Basin is around three times larger and has twice as much stretched continental crust as the Campos Basin The transitional phase is also thought to represent the period in which the Santos External High was uplifted relative to the rest of the basin Gomes et al 2009 The volcanic floored sub basins of the Outer High represent a period of seafloor spreading that was aborted early in its development the abandonment of this tectono magmatic process ultimately led to the uplift of the Sa o Paulo Plateau The severely stretched continental crust is interpreted to have been far less dense than the surrounding volcanic crust resulting in isostatic uplift Gomes et al 2009 2013 Drift tectonics have been prevalent on the Brazilian passive margin since the end of the transitional phase The initiation of the drift phase is marked by the cessation of rifting and the commencement of oceanic crust accretion in the mid Atlantic at around 110 112 Ma Moreira et al 2007 Scotchman et al 2010 The Outer High has remained a positive feature throughout its long tectonic history impacting the

of the synrift sequence on the seismic data Fig 3 The synrift deposits occur as two packages reflecting two phases of rifting separated by an unconformity surface Fig 3 This unconformity is thought to be equivalent to the Pre Alagoas unconformity of Wright Barnett 2015 The lower synrift packages show wedging geometries in the hanging walls of the high frequency extensional faults across the SLH Figs 3 4 These deposits are recorded as fluvio lacustrine sandstones conglomerates and playa mudstones of the Pic arras and Itapema Formations and also as containing some extrusive volcanics Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2009 The upper part of the synrift is a carbonatedominated sequence Barra Velha Fm made up of a variety of lithologies including a world class source rock equivalent to the Lagoa Feia Gp of the Campos Basin and fossiliferous molluscan rich coquina facies which also form a prolific reservoir in the Campos Basin Carvalho et al 2000 This unit is interpreted to have formed in a lacustrine environment Carminatti et al 2009 The synrift and the overlying sag sequence are expressed on seismic by the evolution to tectonic quiescence during the sag phase Figs 3 4 The base of sag unconformity probably equates to the Intra Alagoas unconformity of Wright Barnett 2015 Most of the extensional faulting on the SLH terminates at the base of sag unconformity and the growth wedges seen in the synrift are largely absent within the sag sequence The sag phase carbonates record a variety of different seismic facies the most common configuration is for the sag sequence to onlap infill and drape the antecedent rift topography Figs 3 4 Aggradational build ups and progradational clinoforms are also present and are discussed in detail below The sag succession is thought to have been deposited over a period of around 7 myr Karner Gamboa 2007 The upper part of the Barra Velha Fm passes from lacustrine coquina limestones into a microbialite chemically precipitated non marine carbonate succession Wright Barnett 2015 The absence of unambiguous palaeoecologically significant fossils together with the presence of the mineral stevensite rather than marine derived evaporites sulphates and chlorides indicates an alkaline lacustrine setting with a volcanic source area Wright Barnett 2015 The Barra Velha Fm exceeds 500 m in thickness and together with the underlying Itapema and Pic arras Formations comprises some 4200 m of section Wright Barnett 2015 Seismic stratigraphy of the SLH Sag sequence The oldest interface interpreted from the seismic data is that between the basement and the base of the synrift this is typically a peak reflector SEG Normal which represents an increase in acoustic impedance as the lithology changes from basal clastic synrift infill to the underlying volcanics of the Camboriu Formation Figs 3 4 The lower and upper synrift units are separated by a variably developed unconformity Fig 3 This can be a very subtle feature to interpret on the seismic data The lower synrift fill tends to be thicker than that of the upper synrift with more steeply dipping and wedging geometries Another unconformity separates the upper synrift from the sag sequence which was deposited in the largely quiescent transitional phase between rift and drift tectonics The reflectors within this package are largely unfaulted parallel low angle dip and commonly onlap the unconformity surface Figs 3 5 The sag sequence records a series of seismic features that help to build a regional picture of structural evolution and sedimentation in the basin These are discussed in more detail in the following section The thickness of the sag sequence is strongly influenced by the different depositional environments on the high which appear to be primarily dictated by proximity to the base level of lacustrine waters The interplay between deposition and erosion as well as the potential for an influx of locally derived detrital sediment make for a series of complex relationships across the SLH As can be seen in Figure 4 the sag sequence is not present over all of the SLH This is also evident in previously published images of the Lula field Carminatti et al 2009 Scotchman et al 2010 where the sag sequence can be seen to thin and onlap tilted basement fault blocks that subcrop the base evaporite unconformity The extent of the sag sequence on the crest of the SLH appears to relate to both erosional and depositional factors although isolating their relative importance is difficult Truncated reflectors at the top of the sag sequence suggest that initial deposition over most of the SLH was followed by erosion of the higher topography as base level fell The very uppermost areas may have been sites of non deposition although there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that non deposition was more or less likely than deposition followed by erosion The dominant lithologies of the crestal area of the SLH are most likely a combination of exposed uplifted basement and early synrift deposits Downdip from the crest of the high in addition to the

of the most prominent features seen within the sag sequence is an aggradational flat topped area with a series of build ups located on the eastern margin of the SLH Figs 4 5 This is labelled the Terminal Horst Platform and its eastern margin marks the break of slope where the Sa o Paulo Plateau meets the deeper basin The platform overlies a relatively thin synrift package compared with the thickened synrift sequences in the adjacent half graben Fig 5a This implies a positive structure for the Terminal Horst Platform during synrift deposition The platform is a north south elongate flat topped structure that extends for 65 km along the margin of the SLH and is about 10 km wide west east Fig 6 The northern and southern ends of the platform are not seen in the study area The west east section Fig 5a indicates a preserved mounded margin and slope that originated in the upper synrift and shows aggradational stacking with some backstepping of the margin through the sag sequence to the base evaporites unconformity A prominent feature of the platform is the serrated eastward or basinward facing margin The serrations are a series of promontories with intervening gullies spaced at between 5 and 12 km apart Figs 5b 6 The promontories vary in planview shape from short 15 km transverse ridges parallel to the margin to triangular projections to elongate promontories extending eastward out into the basin Figs 5b 6 Downslope they pass into areas with either rough or smooth relief In cross section the promontories are typically around 300 m in height with a variable lateral extent ranging from 2 to 5 km Figs 5b 6a Their cross sectional morphology varies from sharp and angular peaks with a steep relief to more rounded gentler peaks The internal reflectors of the promontories appear to be aggradational with an essentially flat basal reflector at the base of the sag unit that evolves vertically into convex up reflectors that eventually conform to the final surface of the promontories Figs 5b 6a While lateral truncation of some of the reflectors could be interpreted the majority of the promontories are interpreted as aggradational constructions or build ups Subsequent erosion of the margins of these features to create gullies Figs 5b 6 may also be interpreted As these structures have not been drilled and we are unaware of other such features being described from the South Atlantic basins all possible interpretations need to be explored The seismic data indicate that the promontories are layered so it has been considered that they could comprise siliciclastic evaporite or carbonate sediments or volcanic strata Although in longitudinal section the promontories have similar aggradationally stacked reflectors to volcanoes e g Burgess et al 2013 the morphology of the entire margin with its flat top and serrated edge does not conform to a volcanic edifice Siliciclastic strata fill lows rather than build promontories if the strata were siliciclastic and the serrated margin and entire escarpment were purely erosional the internal reflectors of the promontories would parallel the base sag unconformity Crosssections show this not to be the case instead they indicate aggradational reflector geometries Evaporites possibly in the form of diapiric structures can also be discounted as the seismic character of the sag sequence is quite different from that of the overlying evaporites that have been proven from drilling Carminatti et al 2009 A carbonate origin seems more likely and is consistent with the knowledge that the late synrift of the Barra Valha Fm of the Santos Basin largely comprises carbonate lithologies Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2009 Terra et al 2009 10 It is further supported by the correlation on regional seismic lines of the sag phase unit from the drilled carbonates of the Lula field to the equivalent unit on the SLH Gomes et al 2013 Carbonate platforms commonly form nearvertical or escarpment margins to a flat topped structure in marine environments James Ginsburg 1979 Read 1985 The promontories have many of the features of the morphology internal structure and relationship to overlying strata that are characteristics of carbonate build ups as opposed to other structures Burgess et al 2013 Similar serrated margins are present on the east facing margin of the Tupi sub high and the smaller Peroba High Figs 2 6b c this morphology is not evident on any of the west facing slopes in this dataset Thus it would appear that the east facing slopes are the sites of preferential aggradation on each of the platforms These aggradational structures are seen to manifest as mounded margins of the platform as imaged

Downloaded from http sp lyellcollection org by guest on April 27 2015 PRE SALT CARBONATES OF THE SANTOS BASIN flow morphologies that suggest a collapse of the escarpment margin These are frequently seen along the slope in our dataset about 65 km The eroded slopes of the eastern margins of the platforms tend to have a much steeper relief than the corresponding west facing slopes which may have encouraged the erosional processes affecting any unstable slope facies It should be noted that the areas of exposed basement lithology on the eastern margin south of the Terminal Horst do not show this serrated style It therefore seems likely that these features are lithology dependent and potentially result from the gravitational collapse of partially lithified carbonate material that formed the mounded facies on the eastern margin of the platform This basinward facing margin of the SLH shows many similarities to the gullied margins of marine carbonate platforms such as Great Bahama Bank Mulder et al 2012 and the Miocene Luconia platforms offshore NW Borneo Vahrenkamp et al 2004 The similarity of the serrated morphology of the margin in these marine and non marine environments suggests that there may be a common process The combination of enhanced rates of localized accumulation oversteepening and the subsequent downslope collapse that takes place on the margins of modern carbonate platforms may explain the apparent truncations on the edges of the promontories Prograding clinoforms Directly downslope of the exposed basement at the crest of the eastern end of the SLH are a series of prograding clinoforms The clinoforms are best developed on the southern margin of a structural depression c 10 km across to the west of the escarpment margin to the Terminal Horst Platform Fig 7a The clinoforms prograde to the north and NE into this depression and typically extend for around 10 km from its southern margin reaching thicknesses of 450 m Fig 7b The clinoforms partially fill the depression and die out into what is interpreted as a deeper water lacustrine area to the north The best examples of the clinoforms are located on the southern margin of the depression and thicknesses and extent decrease to the north along the western margin of the depression There are limited examples of clinoforms visible to the west of the ridge that bounds the northern section of the depression which are insignificant in thickness and extent in comparison The clinoforms have a concave up profile and an average maximum angle of slope of 138 They record several fluctuations in base level with phases of onlap and aggradation visible within the overall progradational sequence Fig 7b Thus base level occasionally rose during the longer period of still stand or fall when clinoform progradation occurred Following the progradation base level was lowered further resulting in desiccation and evaporite accumulation Discussion The lithology of the clinoforms cannot be determined on seismic data alone Regional data indicate that the sag sequence is carbonate dominated in this area Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2009 Gomes et al 2013 However the location of the clinoforms adjacent to exposed basement and eroded synrift section suggests that they could be of clastic detrital carbonate or lacustrine carbonate composition Their maximum observed angle of slope could have developed in any of these lithologies and is not diagnostic Different hypotheses are explored below The crestal area of the SLH covers an area of around 2000 km2 with basement and truncated synrift packages being the dominant lithologies subcropping the base evaporite unconformity Fig 4 Extensional faulting across the high created a series of rift shoulders that could have focused sediment transport from the updip highs in the south towards the structural lows downdip to the north Fig 7a This is consistent with the thicker and more extensive clinoforms that can be seen here on the seismic data The western margin of the depression has a significantly smaller updip sediment source area than the southern margin which may explain why the clinoforms are less developed there If detrital input to the system was dominant instead of carbonate accumulation the clinoforms here may represent the formation of an alluvial fan or a delta depositing clastics at or near the margin of the palaeo depression One of the key problems in attempting to validate this hypothesis is that whilst synrift reflectors can be seen to truncate at the base of the evaporites the basement is virtually characterless on seismic and therefore any contribution of detrital basement clastic sediment cannot be quantified via mass balance calculations The erosional truncation of synrift reflectors in close proximity to the crest of the high means that there is potential for a mixed clastic carbonate sequence being redeposited downslope However whether carbonates here have been subject to erosion as opposed to non deposition is difficult to determine the carbonate sequences can be seen to onlap the tilted and uplifted basement in the areas of lower topography with the upper limit of depositional onlap unclear The seismic data suggest that there was at least some clastic input from the large

volume in press Published models for lacustrine carbonates focus on three main sites for the accumulation of insitu build ups lake margin bioherms biostromes shallow lake floor bioherms biostromes and spring fed thermal or groundwater build ups Wright 2012 Della Porta 2015 The aggradational buildups interpreted in this study on the eastern margin of the SLH platform could either be subaqueous mounds bioherms preferentially located on the footwall scarp of the SLH or spring fed hydrothermal build ups originating above the fault bound eastern margin The latter interpretation is not supported by the seismic data as most of the marginal build ups are not sited over visible faults The build ups arise from flat lying reflectors and are some 5 km from the eastern block bounding fault The build ups are therefore more akin to sedimentary mounds bioherms cf Baskin et al 2015 Bucheim Awramik 2015 than to travertine ridges cf Della Porta 2015 and references therein The relatively planar upper surface to the platform and the consistent thickness of the marginal aggradational facies belt prior to collapse suggests a subaqueous origin being constrained by a previous lake level A hydrothermally sourced deposit that could be subaqueous cf Pyramid Lake or subaerial cf Italian ridge travertines would be expected to be more prone to height variation along the margin according to the relative volumes of fluids and their associated water chemistry The erosion of the eastern margin of the SLH and redeposition of sediment from the margin into the basin appears to correlate with a thickening of strata in the basin which attests to an increase in carbonate production over accommodation on this margin This relationship is also suggested by the presence of the clinoforms Fig 8 although these may be carbonate mixed clastic carbonate or pure clastic in origin Based purely on seismic data it is not possible to state what the lithology might be The angle of slope is too low 138 to be diagnostic clear mounded or aggradational build ups are not seen but neither is a feeder channel from the presumed source area to the south Geological evolution of the SLH Erosion of SLH A long period of erosion preceded the accumulation of Lower Cretaceous strata on this basement high The basement was exposed to erosion through the synrift and possibly sag phases and truncated reflectors in the synrift indicate erosion on the footwall shoulders and the crest of the SLH Flooding and submergence of the SLH Whilst the crest of the SLH was most likely exposed during the synrift and sag phases this distally located basement high formed a positive structure that was eventually submerged by rising lake levels Flooding is indicated by onlap and aggradational geometries in this isolated presumed largely clastic free lacustrine carbonate platform The uppermost limit of the clinoforms and the top of the aggradational buildups on the eastern margin of the platform represent lake level at this time Fig 8 Carbonates on the margin of the high are aggrading at this point forming a raised rim on the edge of the platform and represent the highest lake level reached Owing to their common height they are not considered to be subaerial tufa or fault related travertine pinnacles or ridges rather subaqueous platform margin mounds bioherms Receding lake levels Evidence for relative lake level fall comes from two sources Firstly the clinoforms near the top of the sag phase show downstepping sigmoidal geometries indicating base level fall This fall was not continuous and small aggradational packages indicate episodic lake level rises The margin of the platform also shows some features that can be attributed to base level fall erosional scars redeposited slope facies and thickened units in nearby basinal areas Evaporite accumulation The overlying Albian evaporites must represent a final Early Cretaceous base level rise to provide the accommodation for the c 2 km of evaporites that overlie the pre salt carbonates Economic implications The Terminal Horst Platform described in this study from seismic data suggests some similarities and some differences with the economically important Lula or Tupi field Although little detail has been published on this field with the exceptions of Carminatti et al 2009 and Gomes et al 2013 the reservoir interval is stated to be within lacustrine carbonates of the sag sequence that onlap a basement high and are sealed by overlying evaporites The sag sequence has been traced laterally on regional seismic sections to the SLH where we demonstrate an onlapping sag sequence together with the overlying evaporites In this study however we are able to image describe and interpret some of the depositional morphology of the carbonate unit and propose some prospective primary reservoir facies The Terminal Horst Platform on the eastern margin of the SLH is interpreted as a flat topped carbonate platform with a mounded and aggradational margin and steep basinward

interest in the exploration of the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian and African marginal basins More than half of Brazilian oil production originates from the Pre Salt reservoirs of these offshore basins A study integrating systematic petrography cathodoluminescence scanning electron microscopy microprobe and X ray diffraction was performed on seven wells in the northern Campos Basin This study highlights the major primary diagenetic and hydrothermal features of the Pre Salt succession with the aim to improve our understanding of the factors that inﬂuence the porosity and permeability distribution in these important lacustrine carbonate reservoirs The Pre Salt deposits correspond to bioclastic grainstones and rudstones syngenetic crusts of fascicular calcite and intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked crust fragments and calcite spherulites Magnesian silicates are frequently associated with carbonate deposits In the sag phase stevensitic laminations constitute the substrate for the precipitation of calcite crusts and spherulites which displace and replace the syngenetic magnesian clay deposits In the rift section stevensitic ooids are mixed with bioclasts or form ooidal arenites Pre Salt carbonate reservoirs have undergone a complex and heterogeneous diagenetic evolution Eodiagenetic processes include the dissolution neomorphism and cementation of bivalve bioclasts in the rift as well as the dissolution of magnesian silicates and their replacement by calcite spherulites silica and dolomite in the sag section Burial alterations are commonly associated with hydrothermal ﬂuids carried through faults and fracture systems These ﬂuids promote dolomitization siliciﬁcation and dissolution at varying degrees and

nucleation on the sediment water interface under the inﬂuence of organic constituents e g Mercedes Martín et al 2016 2017 Chafetz et al 2018 The intense and heterogeneous diagenesis of the Pre Salt deposits resulted in large vertical and lateral variations in the quality permeability and porosity of the reservoirs Although depositional features exerted signiﬁcant control over the diagenetic

has recently been the subject of extensive debate by the scientiﬁc community e g Machel and Lonnee 2002 Davies 2004 Machel 2004 Davies and Smith 2006 In general the hydrothermal alteration of carbonate sequences involves the action of complex physicochemical processes on pre existing rocks which is related to interactions with hot ﬂuids promoting the precipitation of unusual cements including saddle dolomite ﬂuorite barite anhydrite sphalerite and pyrite Neilson and Oxtoby 2008 Hydrothermal processes are evidence for a local geothermal anomaly and require a mechanism or conduit

the percolation of hydrothermal ﬂuids Vieira de Luca et al 2017 and Poros et al 2017 suggested that the percolation of hydrothermal ﬂuids promoted extensive siliciﬁcation in the Pre Salt reservoirs of the Campos and Kwanza Basins respectively The objective of this study is to characterize and interpret the depositional diagenetic and hydrothermal conditions under which the Pre Salt reservoirs from the northern Campos Basin were generated and modiﬁed This study will contribute to the development of more realistic reservoir models Speciﬁc aims involve the characterization of processes and products of probable hydrothermal circulation throughout faults and fractures as well as their impact on the porosity permeability and heterogeneity of the reservoirs 2 Geological context The Campos Basin is located on the southeastern Brazilian margin approximately between the 21st and 23nd south parallels Fig 1 It covers a total area of approximately 100 000 km2 with only 5800 km2 onshore The study area is located in the northern Campos Basin Fig 1 in deep to ultra deep waters The basin originated from rifting of the Gondwana Continent during the Neocomian lowermost Cretaceous which eventually formed the South Atlantic Ocean through separation of the American and African continents e g Rabinowitz and LaBrecque 1979 Austin and Uchupi 1982 Nürnberg and Müller 1991 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 It is aligned with the Kwanza Basin on the African side Winter et al 2007 divided the tectono stratigraphic evolution of the Campos Basin into rift post rift and drift supersequences The rift supersequence was generated during the initial evolution of the basin and is represented by both the volcanic Cabiúnas Formation and the basal interval of the Lagoa Feia Group which corresponds to the Itabapoana Atafona and Coqueiros Formations deposited from the Barremian to the Lower Aptian Fig 2 According to McKenzie 1978 and White and McKenzie 1988 the rift phase of the basin which extended from the Hauterivian to the Aptian was determined by the extension of the lithosphere and by the asthenospheric elevation related to widespread intracratonic tholeiitic volcanism Turner et al 1994 Mohriak et al 2008 Torsvik et al 2009 The basal rift section portion of the Lagoa Feia Group is limited at the top by the so called Pre Alagoas regional unconformity The Itabapoana Formation is composed of proximal marginal sediments including conglomerates sandstones siltstones and red shales whereas the Atafona Formation mostly comprises arenites and siltstones constituted by ooids of stevensite kerolite and other syngenetic magnesian layer silicates that accumulated in alkaline lakes Bertani and Carozzi 1985a 1985b Dias et al 1988 Abrahão and Warme 1990 The Coqueiros Formation consists of mainly carbonate rudstones and grainstones of ostracod gastropod and mostly bivalve bioclasts intercalated with organic shales e g Baumgarten et al 1988 Dias et al 1988 Thompson et al 2015 Models proposed for the depositional environment of these rift bioclastic deposits have related these deposits to playa lake and pluvial lake environments Bertani and Carozzi 1985a storm events bioaccumulated banks and deep lacustrine environments Carvalho et al 2000 and gravitational re deposition from shallow to deeper lacustrine settings Goldberg et al 2017 The post rift supersequence which contains the upper interval of the Lagoa Feia Group was deposited on the regional Pre Alagoas unconformity during the so called sag stage of the basin This supersequence comprises the Itabapoana Gargaú Macabu and Retiro Formations that were deposited during the Middle Upper Aptian Fig 2 The Gargaú Formation comprises sandstones mudrocks and carbonates deposited in a lacustrine environment which grade laterally to the proximal clastic sediments of the Itabapoana Formation Winter et al 2007 The Macabu Formation was deposited in alkaline lacustrine environments under arid climate conditions and comprises argillaceous and carbonate laminites spherulitic carbonate deposits and crusts which were originally interpreted as microbial stromatolites Dias 2005 Muniz and Bosence 2015 These deposits have been re interpreted as chemical precipitates controlled by the geochemistry of lacustrine waters e g Tosca and Wright 2014 Wright and Barnett 2014 2015 Wright and Tosca 2016 A hybrid biotic abiotic precipitation probably occurs in the Pre Salt deposits However the abiotic chemical is the dominant control in the precipitation of the majority of the constituents as evidenced by features that were observed in the petrographic study The upper portion of the post rift supersequence corresponds to the Retiro Formation Fig 2 which is a thick accumulation of evaporites Upper Alagoas This sequence was deposited during the advent of marine incursions under arid climate conditions Leyden et al 1976 Winter et al 2007 and consists essentially of anhydrite halite sylvite and carnallite These evaporites provide a stratigraphic seal for the large hydrocarbon accumulations of the Pre Salt petroleum province 3 Materials and methods For this study samples from seven wells

many samples including asymmetrical spherulites vertically elongated spherulites with lobate borders hemispherulites and single or multiple fascicular aggregates nucleated on spherulites Another relevant aspect of the analyzed samples is the very good preservation of the ﬁbrous habit of original calcite crystals in many of the fascicular calcite crusts and calcite spherulites Fig 8A B which

several alkaline and saline lakes e g Bradley and Fahey 1962 Tettenhorst and Moore 1978 Darragi and Tardy 1987 Calvo et al 1999 Cuevas et al 2003 Pozo and Galán 2015 The predominant Mg layer silicates occurring in the Pre Salt succession are kerolite a hydrated form of talc and mostly stevensite which is a smectite Bertani and Carozzi 1985a 1985b Tosca and Wright 2014 Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2016 The widespread precipitation of stevensite indicates that the Pre Salt lacustrine environments of the Campos and Santos Basins presented high alkalinity pH 10 high concentrations of silica and magnesium and low pCO2 Tosca and Masterson 2014 Tosca and Wright 2014 2015 The commonly very ﬁne and silky microfabric and the wavy laminations of these magnesian clay phases in the Aptian deposits Fig 3 suggest precipitation as a cryptocrystalline with perhaps even a colloidal syngenetic phase possibly as a poorly crystalline hydrated Mg silicate gel Tosca and Wright 2014 The laminated stevensitic deposits were probably deposited in low energy environments while the ooids are likely to have been formed under some agitation caused by waves or currents with peloids probably deposited in intermediate energy conditions Armelenti et al 2016 Herlinger Jr et al 2017 Fine grained deposits of stevensite and other Mg silicates occur throughout the whole Aptian Pre Salt succession and their recurrent and widespread distribution indicates that they constituted the background of sedimentation in the wide hyper alkaline sag lakes The salinity of the ﬂuid is an important factor in Mg clay precipitation Pozo and Calvo 2018 The Mg clay deposits were commonly dissolved and or replaced by silica calcite dolomite or magnesite The widespread dissolution of Mg clays in the Pre Salt deposits probably occurred under eodiagenetic conditions related to the low stability and fast dissolution kinetics of stevensite in a scenario of high pCO2 with a pH below 8 Tosca and Wright 2015 The dissolution of stevensite and other Mg silicates may have occurred either by the inﬂux of CO2 related to magmatic and or hydrothermal activity or by the dilution of lacustrine waters owing to relatively more humid climatic conditions e g Renaut et al 1986 De Wet et al 2002 5 2 Syngenetic and eodiagenetic calcite The main Pre Salt Aptian reservoirs commonly correspond to crusts made of coalescent aggregates of divergent ﬁbrous fascicularoptic sensu Kendall 1977 calcite with predominantly vertical and shrub like growth which are similar to abiotic stromatolites Grotzinger and Knoll 1999 Riding 2008 and abiotic travertines ray crystal shrubs sensu Chafetz and Guidry 1999 Fig 4A B C According to Chafetz and Guidry 1999 the ray crystal shrubs that are characteristic of some travertines which are similar to those observed in the crusts of fascicular calcite of the sag deposits are a product of chemical abiotic precipitation related to CO 2 loss and evaporation Likewise Riding 2008 characterized the stromatolites formed by ﬁbrous aggregates such as those of the Pre Salt interval as a product of abiotic precipitation These deposits could be identiﬁed as a coarse crystalline equant spar or radial ﬁbrous calcite The syngenetic magnesian clays deposits with a subordinate amount of siliciclastic mud constituted the substrate on and within calcite crusts and spherulites that were chemically precipitated Fig 13 The interruption and deformation of the stevensite laminations indicate that the Pre Salt calcite spherulites were formed within these ﬁnegrained deposits replacing and displacing the clay laminations during eodiagenesis Wright and Barnett 2015 Figs 4E F 13B and not as suggested by Chafetz et al 2018 around bacterial colonies and or their bioproducts probably while aﬂoat in a lacustrine water column before settling to the water sediment interface The displacement is not linked to compaction because the calcite spherulites between the stevensitic matrix laminations did not present features such as grain fracturing and or deformation Therefore the calcite spherulites were formed as concretions replacing and or displacing ﬁne grained deposits constituted by syngenetic magnesian silicates and minor extrabasinal siliciclastic mud Fig 13B Larger and asymmetric spherulites formed closer to the water sediment interface WSI and at a greater relative distance smaller and symmetrical growth of spherulites took place The distinction between spherulitic and fascicular growth forms was probably deﬁned by the higher ionic supply and rate of precipitation for the latter as well as by the availability of free space for vertical growth Grotzinger and Knoll 1999 Wright and Barnett 2014 Wright and Tosca 2016 The fascicular calcite crusts are syngenetic precipitates that formed directly on the WSI Fig 13C D Their irregular stratiﬁcation is related to the intercalation of levels of crystalline calcite with a ﬁner texture or mostly of ﬁne grained syngenetic Mg silicates and terrigenous sediments The continuous ﬁbrous crystalline fabric of the fascicular crusts characteristic of the main reservoirs of the Aptian Pre Salt succession has been interpreted in Archean and Paleoproterozoic stromatolites Grotzinger and Knoll 1999 Riding 2008 and in travertines Chafetz and Guidry 1999 as being a product of chemical abiotic precipitation Wright and Barnett 2015 Herlinger Jr et al 2017 This interpretation differs from the processes of mineralization encrustation or sediment trapping and binding by benthic microbial communities Burne and Moore 1987 Riding 2000 Therefore the name microbialite should not be used for those reservoirs The intense and extensive precipitation of thick and laterally coalescent fascicular calcite crusts was probably associated with changes in the lake water chemistry related to increased runoff during less arid periods and or with CO2 input by magmatic and hydrothermal activity The irregular stratiﬁcation of the deposits was probably related to the interruption or decrease of calcite precipitation thus promoting the intercalation with microcrystalline calcite aggregates or with ﬁne grained stevensitic or terrigenous mud deposits The high frequency of these cycles throughout the succession would imply that the alternated precipitation of stevensite or calcite could not be promoted by large scale changes in the chemistry of the huge sag lakes but rather in local conditions which are potentially related to patterns of circulation and or stratiﬁcation of the lake waters The Mg matrix is later dissolved and preserves only syngenetic and eodiagenetic constituents fascicular calcite and spherulitic aggregates and generates secondary porosity Wright and Barnett 2017 Herlinger Jr et al 2017

74 B E M Lima L F De Ros Sedimentary Geology 383 2019 55 81 hydrothermal ﬂuids through fault zones and or unconformities could locally modify the reservoir quality Jones and Xiao 2013 However the distinction of a hydrothermal mineral would only be possible if one considers its temperature of formation relative to the temperature of the surrounding rocks at the time of mineral formation The characteristics that are most commonly cited in the literature to deﬁne hydrothermal alteration in carbonate deposits are ﬂuid temperatures higher than those of the host rocks ﬂuids directly or indirectly related to magmatic processes with or without the introduction of juvenile water ﬂuid ﬂow carried through fault and fracture systems and local precipitation of exotic mineral assemblages with diverse compositions relative to the host rocks However it should be noted that several of these are not exclusive and that the characteristics mentioned above may be impractical to apply such as a measurement of temperature higher than that of the host rocks The processes of physicochemical alteration have certain determinant factors such as the pH temperature and the composition of ﬂuids that are rich in gases and ions Davies and Smith 2006 deﬁned hydrothermal dolomitization as a process that occurs along structural lineaments under burial conditions commonly at shallow depths and that is related to hypersaline ﬂuids with temperatures and pressures higher than those occurring in the host carbonate formation According to Packard et al 2001 some types of dolomite occurring in the Wabamun Group Upper Devonian in Parkland Field Canada exhibit a wide variety of crystallinity and microfabrics and are interpreted as products of hydrothermal dolomitization Saddle dolomite occurs both as replacement for the original carbonate rock as well as by cement ﬁlling the secondary porosity Dolomite deposits would be the result of recrystallization under the strong inﬂuence of successive ﬂuids and formed during relatively short periods of intense hydrothermal activity The porosity and permeability in host carbonate facies control the lateral extension of peripheral ﬂow Thus the distribution and geometry of depositional and eodiagenetic facies of the host carbonates are critical for the lateral extension of hydrothermal dolomitization as well as for the types volume and distribution of porosity Xu et al 2015 Many of the Pre Salt samples that were analyzed in the study area were strongly affected by fracturing dissolution recrystallization pervasive dolomitization and siliciﬁcation and the precipitation of calcite dolomite quartz chalcedony Sr barite celestine pyrite chalcopyrite galena sphalerite zeolite and bitumen mainly ﬁlling secondary porosity This unusual mineral assembly is totally incompatible with the Pre Salt carbonate host rock which indicates that its precipitation occurred from hydrothermal ﬂuids Despite the relatively low average percentages hydrothermal phases are present in most rift and sag samples Tables 1 2 Both in lithologic types dolostones and cherts as in intensely dolomitized and siliciﬁed samples the mean values are slightly higher which reveals their intrinsic relationship with hydrothermal dolomitization and siliciﬁcation In many situations recrystallization almost totally obscured the original ﬁbrous fabric of the fascicular or spherulitic aggregates which were transformed into a mosaic of anhedral calcite crystals The partial replacement of the Mg clay matrix calcite spherulites and fascicular aggregates by microcrystalline and blocky dolomite and magnesite is possibly the result of eodiagenetic and or mesodiagenetic processes and occurs clearly prior to siliciﬁcation Figs 4 8 10C 11A 14 Replacement of the Mg clay by dolomite is a common feature and is quite clearly seen in the thin sections Fig 4D E A simpliﬁed reaction could be written as stevensite þ 2 8Ca2þ þ 7 6CO2 þ 15 6H2 O 2 9dolomite þ 4H4 SiO4 þ 5 6Hþ Such reaction would decrease the original very high pH It occurs in both eodiagenetic and mesodiagenetic dolomitization but is more speciﬁc for processes that occurred during burial and under the inﬂuence of hydrothermal ﬂuids Replacement of stevensite by ﬁner crystalline dolomite and by magnesite as well as by microcrystalline quartz has also occurred during eodiagenesis The origin of the huge CO2 volume required for the massive syngenetic and eodiagenetic precipitation of carbonates is one of many mysteries of the Pre Salt section but the coeval magmatism and probable mantle exhumation e g Boillot et al 1987 Manatschal and Bernoulli 1999 Whitmarsh et al 2001 Kusznir and Karner 2007 can be considered the most likely sources The blocky dolomite does not present silica inclusions which indicates that it is a pre existing phase that was formed in the carbonate that was later siliciﬁed The hydrothermal saddle dolomite in the rift and sag sections occurs both as replacement for the pre existing constituents as well as cement ﬁlling primary and secondary porosity Fig 15 In many situations these two types appear to have been formed contemporaneously from hot hypersaline and acidic ﬂuids favoring dissolution When it occurs as a cement ﬁlling the saddle dolomite is characterized by aggregates of large crystals with characteristic curved faces and undulating extinction being more indicative of a hydrothermal conﬁguration Important siliciﬁcation has been described in sedimentary and volcanic rocks as well as in pedogenetic and hydrothermal deposits

sinters is frequently a product of the decrease in silica solubility with a temperature and or pH drop which is the main factor affecting the precipitation of hydrothermal silica CO2 degassing can lead to a sudden increase in pH which increases the solubility of silica in the residual ﬂuids Jones and Renaut 1996 Most lacustrine cherts are composed of microcrystalline and cryptocrystalline

even notice the replacement of saddle dolomite by hydrothermal silica Figs 12F 15C Often phases such as calcite pyrite chalcopyrite galena Sr barite celestine sphalerite svanbergite zeolite rutile and bitumen which are associated with siliceous phases replace carbonates or cement primary and or secondary pores Fig 15D In the Pre Salt section hydrothermal siliciﬁcation occurs in carbonate packages associated with hydrothermal dolomites according to the model proposed by Packard et al 2001 The hydrothermal ﬂuids that are responsible for the dolomitization and siliciﬁcation of carbonates would have had a common origin only marginally evolved compared to the original composition Saturated hydrothermal ﬂuids with respect to silica which are marginally saturated in relation to dolomite but are critically unsaturated with respect to calcite were responsible for the selective substitution of preexisting carbonate with signiﬁcant porosity creation The characterization of the processes that are related to hydrothermal ﬂuids is essential for the establishment of the most adequate production management strategy for these Pre Salt reservoirs Analyzing the Pre Salt interval in the Kwanza Basin analogous to that of the Campos Basin Poros et al 2017 obtained ﬂuid inclusions homogenization temperatures Th between 95 and 115 C in the dolomite cement 95 and 125 C in the silica chert and chalcedony replacing carbonate and between 105 and 125 C in the pore ﬁlling mega quartz Those authors interpreted both the replacive chalcedony and the quartz cement that precipitated from high T ﬂuids T 98 123 C associated with hydrocarbons CH4 and CO2 in a burial diagenesis context According to Girard and San Miguel 2017 temperatures ranging from 180 to 200 C that were obtained from the ﬂuid inclusions hosted in dolomite calcite quartz ﬁlling intergranular and fracture pores and isotopic analyzes δ18O δ13C 87Sr 86Sr on carbonates indicated a hydrothermal origin for the ﬂuids responsible by the diagenesis that modiﬁed the Pre Salt reservoirs in the Kwanza Basin The analogy of the Kwanza Basin with patterns that were observed in the Campos Basin Pre Salt supports the interpretation that the intense dolomitization siliciﬁcation and dissolution that were described in part of the analyzed samples may be related to the percolation of hydrothermal ﬂuids through faults and hypogenic karst systems Some occurrences of APS minerals such as svanbergite are associated with hydrothermal mineralization related to magmatic and or volcanic activity According to Dill 2001 hypogenic APS mineralization can be formed from hydrothermal ﬂuids at temperatures as high as 200 C Vila and Sillitoe 1991 described chalcedony barite and APS minerals that precipitated from hydrothermal ﬂuids associated with Cu Au porphyry type and epithermal ore deposits in a magmatic hydrothermal system The formation of APS minerals is commonly associated with intrusion driven hydrothermal systems which may also be responsible for volcanic hosted APS mineralization Dill 2001 In recent years increasingly important diagenetic changes in carbonate reservoirs have been related to magmatic activities Magmatic activities may not only provide hydrothermal ﬂuids but they also cause convection due to high temperature Wilson et al 2007 Xu et al 2015 They may also result in the formation of fractures and secondary porosity thus creating or modifying preferred paths for the migration and accumulation of hydrocarbons According to Xu et al 2015 in the Bachu region of the Tarim Basin northwest of China hydrothermal ﬂuids migrated to Ordovician carbonate rocks along faults fractures unconformities and or lithological contacts during the intrusive magmatism that occurred in the Cambrian and Permian Hiemstra and Goldstein 2015 reported episodic injections of hydrothermal ﬂuids associated with tectonic and magmatic activity on Pennsylvanian marine carbonates in the Indian Basin U S A A potential source of Mg silica and heat in hydrothermal systems in the Pre Salt deposits of the Campos Basin could be provided by the intrusive and extrusive magmatic rocks that occur in the Campos Basin and or by the serpentinization of the exhumed mantle Pinto et al 2017 Winter et al 2007 describe magmatic events occurring in the 77 rift phase during deposition of the sag section and in the Santonian Campanian According to Wendte et al 1998 the dolomitization that was caused by the brines that formed from the subsurface dissolution of evaporite deposits could have been discarded due to the low volumes of Mg 5 4 Paragenetic evolution The sequence of post depositional processes affecting the sag and rift intervals was interpreted based on the paragenetic relationships of the processes and products with primary constituents among each other and with the pores as observed in optical electronic and cathodoluminescence images and attributed to eodiagenetic mesodiagenetic and hydrothermal stages The relative timing of each process product and its importance relative to porosity evolution are summarized in Fig 16 In the diagenetic evolution that was recognized in the analyzed Aptian rocks fracturing occurred preferentially in the intervals that were more intensely affected by siliciﬁcation Dissolution promoted the generation of channel intra crystalline aggregates

zeolite and solid bitumen Locally the dissolution of some hydrothermal phases such as saddle dolomite sphalerite zeolite and Sr barite is responsible for the generation of intracrystalline porosity Macrocrystalline mosaic calcite with orange CL zonation commonly ﬁlls both primary and secondary porosity and occurs more frequently in large dissolution cavities and fractures Fig 11D E F Solid bitumen is described as a usual component in hydrothermal mineral paragenesis e g Anderson 1991 Mansurbeg et al 2016 that is associated with relatively high temperature barite ﬂuorite sphalerite and saddle dolomite The occurrence of solid bitumen in barite hydrothermal mineralization is very common in some geological contexts e g Paradis and Lavoie 1996 Piqué et al 2009 The dynamic and cyclical characters of the precipitation and dissolution processes of these mineral phases are related to intrinsic characteristics of hydrothermal alteration associated with its transient multiphase and multi episode aspects and to the variable chemical composition of the ﬂuids The mixing of hydrothermal and formation ﬂuids may favor dissolution especially in carbonate rocks and the consequent formation of secondary porosity Corbella et al 2006 Biehl et al 2016 Despite its possible reduced effect on the total pore volume pores that connected more frankly and effectively in the vicinity of these hydrothermal vents should have a great inﬂuence on the dynamic behavior of the reservoir In this system the fractures acted as important conduits through which the hydrothermal ﬂuids were injected thus creating moldic and vugular porosity In the rift bioclastic deposits much of the diagenesis occurred prior to compaction During eodiagenesis the following processes occurred micritization

settings giving rise to distinct textural fabrics that influ ence petrophysical characteristics and ultimately impact reservoir quality In lacustrine systems facies variations are associated with fac tors such as lake depth water chemistry shoreline morphology and fetch Platt and Wright 1991 McGlue et al 2010 Nutz et al 2018 which control the energy regime of the environment and determine the occurrence of reworked deposits Furthermore the occurrence of faults can induce the formation of reworked sediments adding more complexity to the system The carbonates of the BVF were deposited during the transition from the rift to the sag phase leading to notable fluctuations in lake morphology and water levels resulting in distinct facies associations and lateral distribution within the basin Minzoni et al 2020 In this context our study proposes an integrated approach that combines in terpretations derived from seismic data borehole image logs core samples and thin sections to investigate the key characteristics and evidence of reworked facies in a pre salt field within the Santos Basin The primary objective is to elucidate the nature of these reworked de posits their relationship with in situ deposits and their correlation with the structural and depositional evolution of the BVF from the sag phase of the basin This research represents a significant advancement in un derstanding the geological history of the BVF shedding light on the complexities of sedimentary processes and providing insights for future exploration and reservoir management endeavors The sedimentary sequence of the BVF was initially interpreted as biogenic in origin due to the recognition of microbial carbonate facies associated with grainstones packstones and shales deposited in lacus trine environment Moreira et al 2007 Terra et al 2010 Mann and Rigg 2012 Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2016 However other authors such as Wright and Barnett 2015 present different models and describe a chemical abiotic model in shallow evaporitic lakes with the occurrence of cyclic depositions Additional models such as the evaporitic model Farias et al 2019 depict evaporitic sedimentation patterns in endorheic basins while the travertine model Erthal et al 2017 indicates the formation of different morphotypes of travertine systems under various hydrothermal and environmental conditions 2 Geological setting 3 2 Borehole image log interpretation The Pre Salt sequence in the South Atlantic has its genesis linked to the separation of South America and Africa during the Cretaceous breakup of the western Gondwana Aslanian et al 2009 Moulin et al 2010 The Santos Basin located in the southeast of Brazil is the most prolific hydrocarbon producer in the Brazilian pre salt province It is separated from the Pelotas Basin by the Floriano polis High to the south and from the Campos Basin by the Cabo Frio High to the north The sedimentary record of the Santos Basin comprises three phases broadly identified as the Rift approximately 138 123 million years ago My Post rift or sag approximately 123 113 My and Drift approximately 113 0 My Moreira et al 2007 The Rift Supersequence as described by Moreira et al 2007 includes the Camboriú Piçarras and Itapema formations The Guaratiba Group belong to the Post Rift Supersequence charac terized as continental and marginal deposits Moreira et al 2007 Fig 1 The evaporites of the Ariri Formation primarily composed of halite and anhydrite were deposited over the Barra Velha Formation forming a regional seal for the petroleum system Moreira et al 2007 The Aptian BVF is internally divided by the Intra Alagoas uncon formity which separates the Lower Barra Velha below from the Upper Barra Velha above Wright and Barnett 2015 Gomes et al 2020 Minzoni et al 2020 The thickness of this formation can vary from over 500 m at the depocenter to less than 25 m on fault block highs and may even be locally absent Barnett et al 2018 Minzoni et al 2020 subdivided this formation based on seismic stratigraphic architecture identifying the BVE 300 interval for the Lower BVF below the Intra Alagoas Unconformity and the BVE 200 and BVE 100

walls based on different physical properties such as acoustic impedance or electrical resistivity Lai et al 2018 To characterize the facies of the non cored intervals of well SB E1 an approach based on acoustic image log facies analysis was employed following the guidelines proposed by Lai et al 2018 and Basso et al 2022 This approach identifies visual image characteristics such as color scheme image texture and dip patterns Additionally other data sources were considered for facies and compositional analysis in non cored intervals including photomicro graphs from sidewall cores rock

presented in accordance with the SEG American convention where a peak with positive amplitude represents an acoustic impedance increment blue on seismic sections The dominant wavenumber ranges between 0 005 m 1 and 0 007 m 1 and the velocity at the reservoir depth is approximately 4500 m s resulting in a vertical resolution of approximately 50 m The seismic data was interpreted in the vicinity of well SB E1 to support and contextualize the geological characterization performed at the core and well log scales 3 3 Petrology and petrography The geological description of core samples from well SB

layers exposed to subaerial dehydration at lake margins e g Krainer and Spo tl 1998 Indeed dehydration result in shrinkage and soft sediment deformation of lacustrine silica gels leading to the formation of ruptile layers prone to fragmentation and later reworking Krainer and Spo tl 1998 Possibly the reworking associates with episodes of more significant rainfall in the drainage area runoff as outlined in previous studies cf Pietzsch et al 2018 Figs 3 and 6B In this case the observed vertical stacking of several rudstone layers indicates several episodes of hyper concentrated flows entering the lake suggesting a more humid period characterized by more frequent episodes of higher rainfall The HCF events occur in different pulses forming distinct amal gamated cycles that overlap resulting in incomplete fining upward cy cles often eroded at the top by the reactivation of new flows Interpretation The absence of marine records in the studied facies along with radiogenic strontium data as a proxy described in Pietzsch et al 2018 corroborates the interpretation that the carbonate facies of the Barra Velha Formation including FA1 were deposited in the context of a closed lake The studied interval reveals a substantial number of in situ facies predominantly the SH facies with diverse morphologies providing evidence of high water alkalinity and ion concentration cf Erthal et al 2017 The formation of shrubs in shallower conditions within this lake is directly associated with increased kinetic energy and CO2 degassing Erthal et al 2017 The shallow lake conditions are also supported by the reworking of the top of the SH and SSl facies by the Gm facies attributed to fair weather wave reworking as well as hyper concentrated flow The chemical conditions characterized by high alkalinity and ion concentration in the lake are strongly influenced by hydrothermal vents In the Campos Basin the impact of hydrothermal vents associated with volcanic activity on the mineralogical composition of talcstevensite has been emphasized by several authors Winter et al 2007 Alvarenga et al 2016 Souza et al 2018 have also highlighted the potential influence of hydrothermal inflows in the Santos Basin contributing to the formation of travertine carbonate deposits The hy pothesis of hydrothermal vents supplying essential elements for the development of shrubs and spherulites is supported The inflow rates of and subangular The rudstone facies displays microfacies variations in the pro portions of intraclasts spherulites shrub fragments and sulfides Based on these differences in proportions two distinct microfacies have been identified i intraclast rudstone and ii spherulite rudstone The intraclast rudstone microfacies is characterized by a prevalence of intraclasts showing low sorting and tightly packed grains see Fig 5K Carbonate intraclasts primarily dolomitized or silicified dominate this microfacies and are mostly angular to sub angular in shape These intraclasts can also exhibit laminated textures ranging in size from 0 25 to 7 mm Mudstone clasts elongated and deformed by compaction ranging from 0 4 mm to 2 mm are also present and may be replaced by microcrystalline dolomite On the other hand the spherulite rudstone microfacies contains predominantly larger clasts 2 mm with angular shapes surrounded by coalesced spherulites and spherical spherulites see Fig 5L Despite alteration well preserved shrub fragments with a fan morphology are found in the spherulite rudstone microfacies Dolomite cement in this microfacies varies between microcrystalline hypidiotopic dolomite and sparry dolomite replacing the grains Silica cement occurring in a microcrystalline form fills the porosity and mainly replaces carbonate intraclasts This microfacies exhibits the highest porosity and includes interparticle intraparticle intercrystal line and vug pores 4 1 1 5 1 Depositional process At the top of FA1 the Rfp represents a basal erosive coarse rudstone resulting from hyper concentrated flow HCF as described by Nemec and Steel 1984 and Zavala 2020 HCFs are high density subaerial flows characterized by high sediment load The presence of erosive base and normal grading likely indicates insipient turbulence Turbulent flows are characterized by upward movement of clasts during this process clasts are separated by density where heavier and denser particles settles first resulting in a normal grading arrangement Mulder and Alexander 2001 However the structureless character of the rudstone advocates to the rapid sedimen tation of high density flows which hinders the formation of sedimentary structures Nemec and Steel 1984 In fact the coexistence of high density flows with insipient turbulence might suggest a hyper concentrated flow behaviour sensu Mulder and Alexander 2001 As observed in the Rpf facies some of these reworked rudstones may contain flat pebbles likely associated with the reworking of ruptile Fig

environments The increased concentration of pebbles towards the top of the pebble grainstone facies indicates relatively higher energy conditions cf Hiroki and Terasaka 2005 Milroy and Wright 2000 proposed that the association of oolitic grainstones with gravel conglomerate akin to our massive rudstone facies at the top of the unit suggests highly variable energy levels over relatively short distances This variability implies a response to both storm waves and fair weather processes on a gently inclined beachface 4 1 2 Foreshore shoreface transition deposits FA2 The facies association 2 occurs at the uppermost part of the studied interval and constitute a c 7 m thick coarsening upward sequence that is formed from the base to the top by the following facies i laminated grainstone ii pebble grainstone and iii massive rudstone Fig 7 4 1 2 1 Laminated grainstone Gl The laminated grainstone facies occurs in c 1 m thick beds from 0 9 to 1 2 m that show gradual transition with the facies association 1 at the base and are erosively overlaid by pebble grainstone facies at the top The grainstone beds are organized into c 30 50 mm thick wedge shaped bedsets outlined by low angle flat boundaries of opposing apparent dip directions Fig 7A and A Internally the wedge shaped sets display low angle planar parallel laminae that lye conformably to the set base and show erosive contact with the top set boundary The low angle laminae are c 2 5 mm thick and laterally continuous throughout the core Fig 7A Individual lamina further displays inverse grading varying from medium coarse sand at the base to coarse sand at the top Moreover the grainstone is predominantly composed of ooids and locally displays carbonate and silica clasts interspersed between laminae In thin section the laminated grainstone reveals three alternating microfacies i spherulitic ii oolitic and iii shrubby grainstone The spherulites range from 0 2 to 1 3 mm in diameter and display varying degrees of alteration they exhibit spherical fractured elliptical and polygonal morphologies locally showing coalesced spherulites of different morphologies see Fig 8A The coalesced and fused forms of spherulites are more abundant towards the top of the profile and exhibit less alteration compared to other morphologies see Fig 8B The ooids range from 0 25 to 0 5 mm in diameter showing distinct core compo sitions primarily consisting of spherulites Towards the upper part of the profile the ooids become coarser and display compacted features such as deformed angular shapes and broken edges see Fig 8C Finally the microfacies reveal predominance of hypidiotopic and idiotopic dolomite cementation and further display fragments of bioclasts ostracods pel lets sulfides and phosphates as accessory elements 4 1 2 1 1 Depositional process The laminated grainstone facies provides compelling evidence of swash backwash effects in beach areas A prominent feature of this facies is the presence of wedge shaped sets indicative of bidirectional flows These sets characterized by parallel laminae formed during the lake shoreline elevation demonstrate the planar display of the depositional environment Notably the tops of these laminations show truncation by low angle laminations formed by current crescents on beach faces influenced by backwash flow Bhat tacharya 1993 Laminations resulting from swash backwash processes exhibit inverse grading attributed to high concentration flows where frequent grain collisions occur Asbury and Sallinger 1981 During the initial stages of upwash the breaking of waves on the foreshore induces large scale turbulence leading to a substantial amount of suspended sediment This sediment is then added to the bedload in the final stages of upwash Subsequently the upwash behaves similarly to backwash transporting sediment primarily in a highly concentrated bedload and commonly resulting in inverse grading Clif ton 1969 The presence of low angle laminations associated with well sorted and well rounded reworked grains is a characteristic feature of wavedominated sandy beach environments Clifton 2003 2006 Addition ally the abundance of reworked ooids in this facies often exhibiting tangential fabrics is more likely to be preserved during grain to grain collisions under turbulent conditions Tucker and Wright 1990 4 1 2 3 Massive rudstone Rm The massive rudstone constitute c 1 m thick beds ranging from 0 4 to 1 3 m that erosively overly the lami nated grainstone and occur vertically stacked along a c 2 m thick in terval The rudstone facies demonstrated structureless character and is formed by c 70 150 mm clasts with angular to subrounded angularity and low sphericity resembling irregular to flat tabular pebbles and cobbles Fig 7E The clasts are oligomictic displaying mostly silicified carbonates with subordinate presence of non silicified carbonates Locally the massive rudstone facies shows c 3 5 mm thick silica rich layers Fig 7E In thin section the rudstone facies is formed by the alternation be tween intraclastic and spherulitic rudstone microfacies Both microfa cies show varying proportions of intraclasts spherulites shrub fragments and sulfides they are commonly characterized by low sorting and tightly packed grains see Fig 8G The intraclastic rudstone microfacies shows mostly dolomitized or silicified clasts with angular to sub angular roundness Internally the intraclasts exhibit laminated textures where laminae range from 0 25 to 7 mm in thickness Addi tionally mudstone intraclasts range from c 0 4 2 mm in dimension and resemble elongated clasts that are locally marked by deformed edges and replacive microcrystalline dolomite In contrast the spherulitic rudstone microfacies is formed by larger 2 mm in dimension and angular clasts that occur interspersed between spherical and coalesced spherulites see Fig 8H Moreover well preserved fan shaped shrub fragments are observed displaying some degree of alteration Fig 8I Overall the rudstone microfacies are marked by microcrystalline hypi diotopic dolomite and sparry dolomite cementation Fig 8J Also silica fringe covers the intraclasts and microcrystalline silica is further depicted as porosity infills and carbonate intraclast replacement Fig 8K Finally the rudstone microfacies displays interparticle intraparticle intercrystalline and vug pores and present the highest 4 1 2 2 Pebble grainstone Gp The pebble grainstone facies occurs in c 2 m thick beds enclosed by the laminated grainstone facies displaying erosive lower boundary and gradual transition towards the top 13

R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 shrubstones 3 rudstones grainstones 4 grainstones packstones 5 mudstones 6 mixed reworked carbonates and volcanic sediments and 7 highly diagenetic altered carbonates Facies 1 5 were observed in the cored interval and their detailed petrology and petrography were reported earlier Facies 6 and 7 on the other hand were identified exclusively in the image logs This study revealed that reworked carbonate deposits constitute a significant portion of the BVF approximately 63 of its thickness with grainstones packstones accounting for 36 and rudstones grainstones facies for 17 Volcanic related sediments make up approximately 10 of the BVF The image log displays reworked facies with low amplitude values rough texture and a mottled appearance The mottled texture is characterized by high amplitude bright spots that vary in ge ometry size and abundance zoomed images in the 2nd to 4th panels Fig 9 The reworked carbonates exhibit a wide range of grain sizes including particles up to pebble size The grains primarily consist of intraclasts derived from various BVF facies including fragments of shrubs spherulites mudstones and silicified particles Vertical distri bution analysis of the facies in the SB E1 well shows that grainstones and rudstones dominate in the uppermost 100 m corresponding to the Upper BVF while coarse volcanic related sediments such as volcanic grainstones and rudstones are more prevalent in the Lower BVF The volcanic grainstones rudstones are enriched with altered lithic frag ments primarily of basaltic composition zoomed image in the 4th panel Fig 9 Bedding orientations derived from the interpretation of bedding planes in the image log 3rd column Fig 9 indicate a main dip direction towards the southeast mean azimuth 110 Analyzing the dip di rections within different intervals of the BVF minor variations are observed with the general trend shifting from southeast to east in the lowermost 50 m of the formation The bedding dip angle gradually in creases from 6 31 in the uppermost part of the formation to 24 53 in the basal portion porosity among the studied microfacies Fig 8L 4 1 2 3 1 Depositional process The massive rudstone as well as the Rfp facies is deposited within a hyper concentrated flow HCF context similar to that elucidated by Zavala 2020 These facies showcase notable amounts of coarse particles and matrix featuring tabular clasts Turbulence within the HCF promotes the separation of clasts by density resulting in a normal grading arrangement where the heaviest and densest particles are deposited first a phenomenon well documented by Mulder and Alexander 2001 The lack of sedimentary structures associated with this facies is primarily ascribed to the swift deposition in high density flows as expounded by Nemec and Steel 1984 The significant quantity of eroded in situ facies giving rise to frag ments of shrubs and spherulites alongside associated cobble clasts emerges from the reworking influence of fair weather waves cf Hiroki and Terasaka 2005 Despite the presence of flat pebbles in this facies they manifest in smaller proportions and exhibit a more disordered arrangement The reworking action induced by waves contributes to clast fragmentation and rounding thereby shaping the distinct charac teristics observed cf Hiroki and Terasaka 2005 Interpretation This study interprets the observed facies as indicative of a transi tional zone between the foreshore and shoreface considering the extent of grain rounding and sedimentary structures that align with marginal settings influenced by wave action In the context of a shallow lake we adapted the traditional classification of external shelf environments i e foreshore and shoreface to accommodate the morphodynamic var iations identified in the facies description The presence of oolitic grainstone facies characterized by wellsorted and well rounded grains and lamination ranging from parallel to low angle offers crucial evidence for interpreting a foreshore envi ronment under upper flow regime This suggests upper plane bed deposition on a beach face Elliott 1986 Masuda and Yokokawa 1988 Hiroki and Terasaka 2005 The intercalation of Gp and Gl facies in dicates sporadic increases in swash energy within the foreshore to shoreface The hyper concentrated flow HCF deposited in the surf zone of the upper shoreface facilitating the rounding of pebbles due to the continuous action of fair weather waves The erosive surfaces observed at the base of the Gp facies represent the retreat of foreshore facies due to shoreline advancement cf Hamon Kerivel et al 2020 The Gp and Rm facies suggest a transition zone between the upper and lower shoreface characterized by decreased energy conditions This transition occurs as the surf zone with high activity shifts to a deeper zone dominated by wave shoaling Aagaard 2014 The Rm facies originates from the deposition of HCF in the lower shoreface and ex hibits reworking to a lesser extent by fair weather or storm waves compared to the upper shoreface zone 4 2 2 Seismic interpretation The analysis of reflector geometries and seismic facies distributions provides valuable insights into the stratigraphic evolution of the Barra Velha Formation BVF in the vicinity of well SB E1 The transition between the Itapema Formation ITPF and BVF is marked by the PAU Fig 10 blue line which is a positive reflector exhibiting high ampli tude and characterized by erosional truncations The transition between the BVE 200 and BVE 100 intervals is identified by a negative reflector with high amplitude commonly observed throughout the study area Fig 10 black line In general the ITPF reflectors demonstrate onlap onto the basement and exhibit a greater dip angle compared to the BVF They display an average dip angle of 15 in the southeast direction ranging from irregular to sheet like shapes with low amplitude RGP4 Fig 10B On the other hand the BVF reflectors onlap the basement RGP1 and gradually change their dip angle towards the basin southeast with an average dip angle of 6 in the BVE 200 interval and 3 in the BVE 100 interval Fig 10B These results are consistent with the dip measure ments obtained from the interpretation of bedding planes in the bore hole image log Fig 9 Towards the bottom of the BVF the reflectors exhibit a low ampli tude varying from irregular to sheet like shapes oriented towards the top Fig 10B RGP3 However the reflectors in the upper part of the BVF display a high amplitude and a mounded shape characterized by a bidirectional high amplitude reflector Fig 10B and C RGP2 4 2 Borehole image and seismic interpretation In addition to describing the core samples the borehole image log BHI data Fig 9 of well SB E1 was integrated with seismic in terpretations to enhance our understanding of the stratigraphic evolu tion of the BVF In this study the BVF is divided into two major stratigraphic zones the lower interval known as BVE 200 and the upper interval known as BVE 100 Minzoni et al 2020 Rebelo et al 2022 The base of the BVE 200 is defined by the Pre Alagoas Unconformity PAU while the top of the BVE 100 is marked by the presence of evaporites from the Ariri Formation It should be noted that the BVE 300 interval was not identified at the location of this well 4 2 1 BHI interpretation The acoustic image log interpretation provided insights into the facies composition of non cored intervals covering approximately 285 m of the BVF Fig 9 Following a similar approach as previous studies Muniz and Bosence 2015 Gomes et al 2020 Basso et al 2022 a total of seven facies were identified 1 spherulitestones 2 5 Discussion stratigraphic evolution of BVF Through analyses and interpretations at different scales it was possible to describe the facies associations and correlate them with the stratigraphic evolution of BVF deposits in the study area Although the 14

R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 Fig 12 The evolutive geological model for BVE200 and BVE100 Seismic profile and onlap curve based on seismic interpretations of stratigraphic surfaces reflecting the lake level variation onlap curve indicates a more restricted lake with deposition occurring in a regressive phase of RGP4 The RGP4 indicates a progradational pattern whose topset was eroded by the PAU In the BVF the onlap migration direction undergoes a drastic change shifting landward and evidencing the expanding margins of the lake as expected for a sag phase While we demonstrate transgressive phases in the lake studies such as Pietzsch et al 2018 indicate that no marine contribution oc curs during BVF deposition The seismic data displays a landward onlap migration pattern for the BVF Fig 12 due to increased lake size However the occurrence of a shallowing upward pattern is possible due to high carbonate production and accumulation during the sag phase of the basin both through the chemical precipitation of carbonates in situ and the recurring inputs of transported clastic particles Moreover Pietzsch et al 2018 interpret a shallow endorheic lake with a high evaporation rate based on δ13C and δ18O analyses identifying 13 cycles of lake stage with the last three cycles at the top of BVF exhibiting depleted δ18O This depletion possibly indicates an increase in freshwater or groundwater input into the system promoting a rise in lake level in aligment with our onlap curve Fig 12 The BVE 100 involves the superimposition of coarse reworked facies from a foreshore shoreface transition onto primarily in situ facies from the back barrier deposits This facies association overlap reflects the lateral migration of environments resulting from a retrogradational stacking pattern during transgressive phase in the depositional se quences which is consistent with seismic interpretations and the onlap curve Figs 11 and 12 While we have identified the transgressive pattern of facies associations the stratigraphic profiles exhibit a different facies stacking with a coarsening upward trend attributed to the predominance of rudstone facies at the top of the stratigraphic profiles This coarsening upward stacking is a reflection of lowfrequency cycles that correspond to the lateral shift of the input source of hyperconcentrated flows Fig 12 Andrews et al 2016 describe a similar example to what is discussed here identifying a shallow lake with inter bars ponds and ephemeral fluvial systems that exhibit a lateral shift of the input source influencing the lacustrine shore zone architecture differently and sporadically deposit and rework the top of the lacustrine facies forming a coarsening upward pattern With regards to the BVE 100 the structures associated with RGP2 resemble a mound like carbonate structure The carbonate mound like feature described in this study is a barrier built through low frequency and high frequency cycles with lacustrine in situ facies affected by HCF and wave influence Some cyclic patterns presented in this work particularly the high frequency reworking cycles are partially discussed in Soares et al 2023 The seismic analysis reveals bidirectional dip angles within the RGP2 strata which align with the positioning of carbonate mound like struc tures on the reworked deposits of the BVE 200 Fig 12 However it is important to note that the mound like structures described in this study differ from modern carbonate mounds such as those documented by Hebbeln and Samankassou 2015 Nevertheless similar features can be identified in this study including the formation of belts or clusters of mounds as observed in the seismic images depicted in Fig 10 This cluster pattern is commonly observed in numerous Paleozoic examples worldwide including regions in Morocco and Algeria Wendt et al 2001 Belgium Aretz and Chevaliers 2007 the UK Bridges and Chapman 1988 and New Mexico USA Jeffery and Stanton 1996 6 Hydrocarbon potential and exploration in reworked deposits The increasing demand for energy driven by industrial and social consumption has led to extensive exploration of conventional oil and gas reservoirs Modern stratigraphic studies highlight the significant po tential for hydrocarbon exploration in deepwater environments 17

De Ros 2019 Some of the first works analyzing the pre salt de posits attributed their formation to microbial influenced processes referring to them as microbialites and stromatolites Dias 2005 Moreira et al 2007 Terra et al 2010 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Merce des Martín et al 2016 while others proposed an abiotic origin Wright and Barnett 2015 Tosca and Wright 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Wright 2022 These latter works reported the scarcity of macrostructures and microstructures characteristic of microbial carbonates and the crystal line fabrics and isotopic composition indicative of an abiotic chemo genic origin of the pre salt deposits Herlinger et al 2017 interpreted these deposits as due to syngenetic precipitation controlled by changes of the lacustrine geochemistry resulting essentially in encrustation and replacement of stevensite deposits The existence of peculiar features and mineral phases in these de posits allows the interpretation of different precipitation conditions and makes it difficult to find an ideal analogue Mercedes Martín et al 2017 Deschamps et al 2020 Magalhaes et al 2020 Wright 2022 Furthermore the close connection between the syngenetic and eodia genetic processes highlights the importance of disentangling the diagenesis suffered by the pre salt deposits Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Sartorato et al 2020 Wright and Barnett 2020 Several studies emphasized the role of early diagenesis on the evolution of the deposits mainly related to the dissolution of Mg clay substrates and its replacement by calcite spherulites dolomite and silica Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 In fact the Aptian carbonate rocks of Campos and Santos Basins show that reservoir quality is strongly conditioned by the characteristics of the depositional envi ronment and the associated diagenetic alterations Rezende and Pope 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 The impact of diagenesis on the evolution of porosity and permeability is according to several authors not restricted to early alteration processes clay replacement or dissolution calcite cementation but also to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids in some locations of the basin Vieira de Luca et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Lima et al 2020 Sartorato et al 2020 Thus the combination of these sedimentary and diagenetic processes leads to the formation of complex and heterogeneous reservoirs Un derstanding the spatial distribution of the diagenetic products is essen tial to determine the factors controlling the reservoir properties and to be predictive Morad et al 2012 Whitaker and Frazer 2018 Although previous studies have provided detailed petrographic analyses and paragenetic relationships of the primary and diagenetic constituents of the Barra Velha Formation BVF from the Santos Basin Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Farias et al 2019 Carramal et al 2022 and the coeval Macabú Formation from the Campos Basin Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 an integrated quantitative view of the spatial and temporal distribution of the syngenetic and diagenetic phases is lacking The characterization and interpretation of these pro cesses and products are still a matter of debate and the definition of their quantitative distribution will contribute to the understanding of the paleoenvironmental conditions that drove the formation and mod ifications of these sediments Based on a huge database of petrographic descriptions this study aims to present a comprehensive quantitative characterization of the main depositional and diagenetic features of the lacustrine carbonates of the Barra Velha Formation BVF from a key area of the outer high in the Santos Basin It also seeks to present spatial and temporal distribution patterns of facies and diagenetic products at reservoir scale based on petrography mineralogical analyses and carbon and oxygen stable isotope data Finally it discusses the different processes syngenetic eodiagenetic and late hydrothermal related that control the reservoir heterogeneities of the South Atlantic pre salt succession The results will contribute to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of these carbonate rocks and provide valuable constraints to reservoir characterization 2 Geological setting 2 1 Geodynamics The Santos Basin on the southeastern portion of the Brazilian con tinental margin extends along the coast of Rio de Janeiro Sa o Paulo Parana e Santa Catarina states between parallels 23 and 28 South and covers a total area of approximately 350 000 km2 Fig 1A and B The basin is located between the Pelotas Basin to the south bounded by the Florianopolis high and Campos Basin to the north bounded by the Cabo Frio high Moreira et al 2007 The Santos Basin was formed during Early Cretaceous by the breakup of the Gondwana Continent The Mesozoic rifting started in the southern parts of the South American continent in the Late Jurassic reaching the equatorial margin by Late Aptian Early Albian culminating in the separation of South American and African Plates Rabinowitz and Lab recque 1979 Conceiça o et al 1988 Chang et al 1992 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Moulin et al 2010 The South Atlantic Ocean can be divided into four long segments from North to South the Equatorial segment the Central segment the Austral Segment and the Falkland Segment The beginning of the rupture during the Jurassic occurred in the southern portion of the Austral Segment Popoff 1988 Torsvik et al 2009 Moulin et al 2010 In the Equatorial segment the movement of the continent to the north and northwest was impeded by the young oceanic lithosphere of the Central Atlantic Ocean Gulf of Mexico and proto Caribbean Szat mari and Milani 2016 As a result from about 145 to 113 Ma the South Atlantic rift remained closed in the northwest along the Equatorial margin but widened wedge like to the south along the South America s eastern margin As the rift widened the basaltic volcanism along the Ponta Grossa and Namibia dike swarms created the proto Walvis Ridge which barred the access of ocean waters to the central South Atlantic rift from the South Szatmari and Milani 2016 Moulin et al 2010 reviewing the kinematics of the opening of the South Atlantic proposed that from 132 to 130 Ma the opening occurred between the Walvis Ridge and Pelotas Basin After 130 Ma and until Aptian the Santos block started to follow the general westward move ment of the southern part of South America playing the role of a kine matic buffer between the movements that created the northern Aptian basins Since the rift was also barred from the Central Atlantic Ocean in the northwest where the Equatorial margin had not yet rifted an endorheic lacustrine basin formed Szatmari and Milani 2016 Moreira et al 2007 divided the tectono stratigraphic evolution of Santos Basin into rift post rift and drift supersequences Fig 2 The basement of the Santos Basin is composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks from the Mantiqueira Province generated during the Neo proterozoic Brasiliano Pan African Orogeny Almeida et al 1981 Heilbron et al 2004 The rift phase spans from Hauterivian to Early Aptian time Pereira and Feijo 1994 comprising the rocks of the Camboriú Piçarras and Itapema Formations Figs 1D and 2 This phase is characterized by the development of rotated tilted blocks and half graben basins filled with thick sedimentary successions Milani et al 2007 Alves et al 2017 The Piçarras Formation deposited above the basaltic rocks of the Camboriú Formation comprises alluvial sediments in proximal areas and shales of talc stevensitic composition in lacustrine distal areas In contrast the Itapema Formation is composed of bivalve bioclastic rud stones concentrated on structural high domains and of lime mudstones and organic matter rich shales in the distal parts of the basin Moreira

A M Almeida Carvalho et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 141 2022 105708 4 1 1 Fascicular calcite crusts shrubs This facies consists of calcite crystals presenting fascicular optical texture These crystals grew predominantly in a vertical to sub vertical orientation with an average height of 2 mm Fig 3A The crystal shrubs have a conical form in the longitudinal section that shows height greater than length Farias et al 2019 or in certain layers incipient forms with a height width ratio of about 1 1 The latter can be seen as morphologically intermediate forms between spherulites and crusts The fascicular calcite crusts show intercalations with millimetric to centi metric layers of spherulites re worked particles indistinct fragments of spherulites and shrubs microcrystalline calcite and dolomite creating a laminated macroscopic aspect with locally low relief domical forms Each layered unit can reach 2 m in thickness The association with spherulites is frequent and can make up 30 of the samples Minor constituents comprise argillaceous peloids ostracods bioclasts and Mg clay laminations which can be locally incorporated into calcite aggregates Fig 3B In 30 of the samples the Mg clays appear as interstitial sediment between the carbonate aggregates The pore system is characterized by growth framework and inter crystalline porosity types The fascicular calcite crusts are not microporous carbonate and Mg clay content Ostracods phosphatic fragments and micro spherulitic calcite are present in small quantities Fenestral and intercrystalline porosity are common across lamina tion Microporosity is also frequent and given the remains of organicmatter rich laminae in some samples Fig 3H the porosity genera tion could be related to organic matter degradation Farias et al 2019 The recrystallization of calcite crystals is frequently observed and oc casional breccia and teepee structures occur associated with the cren ulated laminites Fig 3I The breccia is poorly sorted made up of millimetric to centimetric subangular intraclasts of laminites in a ma trix of microcrystalline dolomite Some of the intraclasts are dolomitized and silicified 4 1 4 Intraclastic grainstones The intraclastic grainstones are the main facies in the study area representing 44 of the available samples They are composed pre dominantly of fragments of fascicular calcite crusts spherulites lam inites and different proportions of siliciclastic volcanoclastic grains and Mg clay intraclasts Fig 3J L The carbonate intraclasts are commonly rounded moderately to well sorted with size ranging between fine and coarse sand locally very coarse with tangential to long grain contacts Taylor 1950 Sutured and concave convex contacts are observed but other compaction features fractures stylolithes solution seams are rare This facies has a predominantly massive aspect but may present a normal grading and cross stratification Intercalations with centimetre thick layers of laminites and fascicular calcite crusts are frequent The association of the different components allows to categorize the grainstones in three different sub facies depending on the proportion of these components Type A grainstones are dominated by carbonate fragments with low content or absence of Mg clays and siliciclastic volcanoclastic grains They are the most common type Fig 3J Type B grainstones composed of the most significant content of siliciclastic volcanoclastic grains generally contain silt sized detrital constituents quartz feldspar and mica and sub rounded to sub angular basaltic volcanoclastic fragments Fig 3K They display inverse grading and concavo convex to sutured grain contacts Finally type C grainstones range between a packstone to grainstone texture They show the most prominent content of Mg clays both as grains or matrix and are characterized by the presence of ooids peloids and clay intraclasts Fig 3L The Mg clay content can be partially to totally replaced by calcite They also show minor amounts of ostracods phosphatic frag ments siliciclastic grains and volcanoclastic rock fragments 4 1 2 Mg claystones with spherulites Mg claystones are characterized by Mg clays in association with different proportions of calcite spherulites and dolomite Fig 3C E For sake of clarity the different clay minerals that constitute these Mg clays are characterized in part 4 3 2 The spherulites are spherical to subspherical calcite crystal aggregates with a sweeping extinction and size generally less than 2 mm Based on the macroscopic description it is possible to categorize this facies into two distinct sub facies depending on the relative proportion of spherulites Mg claystones with higher proportions of spherulites and Mg claystones with minor proportions of spherulites The Mg claystones with higher proportions of spherulites 34 on average 83 maximum present variable thickness between 5 cm and 100 cm and display an irregular planar laminated structure marked by spherulites and clay laminae showing a brownish color The spherulites may occur coalesced and recrystallized Fig 3C The Mg clays are present in 56 of the samples and locally represent 50 of the sample constituents Table 1 Silt to sand size siliciclastic grains of quartz and muscovite are frequent and can occur as nuclei of the spherulites Minor occurrences of ostracods are also observed The Mg clays are commonly displaced by calcite spherulites Fig 3D and frequently show partial to total dissolution The dissolution of the clay matrix and spherulites is the primary process generating porosity in this facies that initially possesses a low reservoir quality The Mg claystones with minor proportions of spherulites may exhibit a massive to layered structure Fig 3E generally with centimetric bed thickness Macroscopically it is characterized by alternations of centi metric claystone layers and laminae with sparse spherulites The spherulites are observed in 30 of the samples from this sub facies When present they occur as rare isolated floating grains representing around 3 on average 10 maximum of the constituents The low occurrence or absence of spherulite in 70 of the samples may be explained by 1 a sampling bias as sampling was preferentially done in claystone layers 2 the intense dolomitization and replacement by microcrystalline calcite resulting in the loss of the original fabric Nevertheless these two populations were grouped in the same subfacies 4 2 Facies distribution The well dataset enables the construction of correlation transects which can help to define the facies distribution and proportions both in a spatial and temporal point of view Fig 4 These profiles were reconstructed based on the basement topography assessed from seismic interpretation Artaga o 2018 In the same way schematic fault pro portions are located on these profiles to represent a simplified scheme of the fault network These profiles show the existence of a topographic structural high wells W5 and W10 with a southeastern steep flank wells W11 to W17 and a northwestern low angle slope W1 to W4 and W6 to W9 From a spatial point of view the facies with a large Mg clay content grainstones with Mg clays and Mg claystones with minor proportions of spherulites predominate in lower areas away from the structural high and in relatively low areas within the structural high as in the case of well W4 Fig 4 Furthermore the wells situated in higher structural positions show very low preservation of the Mg clays which occurs mainly as ooids and peloids intensively affected by diagenetic processes as previously reported by Carramal et al 2022 The Mg claystones with high proportions of spherulites predominate in lower and transitional areas and fascicular calcite crusts occur 4 1 3 Laminites This facies is composed of alternating laminae of microcrystalline calcite microcrystalline dolomite Mg clay organic matter and detrital components quartz feldspar and micas Macroscopically it is char acterized by plane parallel flat or crenulated laminations Fig 3F and G and frequent organic matter rich laminae The colors vary between greenish and brownish depending on the proportion of siliciclastic mud 7

A M Almeida Carvalho et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 141 2022 105708 laminites occur in Unit 1 of BVF and mostly on the structural highs The grainstones are observed along the entire transects but with variations depending on the grainstone sub facies The carbonate intraclastic grainstones occur preferentially on the structural highs whereas the grainstones with the largest content of Mg clay are more developed in the lower areas Finally the siliciclastic volcanoclastic dominated grainstones occur mainly in Units 3 and 2 preferentially on the struc tural highs Regarding the stratigraphic distribution the most significant pro portions of Mg claystones with minor proportions of spherulites occur in Units 3 and 2 The Mg claystones with high amount of spherulites pre dominates in Unit 1 Fascicular calcite crusts and intraclastic grainstones predominate in Unit 1 The latter is marked by a more significant pro portion of fascicular calcite crusts particularly towards the lower area of transect B Some sites of the southeast flank show a high proportion of fascicular calcite crusts in Unit 3 as in the case of well W11 Detrital content mainly associated with laminites Mg claystones with spheru lites and grainstones generally occurs in low quantities However its abundance shows a progressive decrease from Unit 3 to Unit 1 Table 2 A slight decrease is observed on the structural high Table 3 minerals represent 90 of the sample s composition Among the sec ondary minerals Ca dolomite K feldspar and magnesite are the most representative The larger and more complete sample dataset analyzed with XRD may explain some differences with the QEMSCAN analyses According to the XRD analyses the clay minerals are composed chiefly of kerolite mixed layer kerolite Mg smectite Mg smectite sepiolite and minor amounts of non magnesian clay minerals such as Illite illite smectite kaolinite and chlorite Fig 6A and B Mg smectite comprised stevensite and saponite Netto et al 2022 but their differ entiation implies additional analyses that were not done for our dataset Fig 6B shows the association between facies and the different clay species Kerolite and mixed layer kerolite Mg smectite are the main Mgclays observed in the case study Fig 6A and B The analyses show that kerolite and mixed layer kerolite Mg smectite are present respec tively in 73 and 55 of the Mg claystones with high amounts of spherulites Supplementary material Fig A1 In the intraclastic grain stones kerolite occurs in 82 of the analyzed samples whereas mixedlayer kerolite Mg smectite is only present in 50 of the samples Ker olite occurs in 70 of the fascicular calcite crusts whereas mixed layer kerolite Mg smectite is present in 40 of the samples Kerolite is also present in 67 of the samples of laminites facies but in low proportions 1 10 of each sample whereas the mixed layer kerolite Mg smectite represents more than 50 of the clay fraction in 44 of the samples Mg smectites occur mostly related to intraclastic grainstones and fascicular calcite crusts being present in 20 of the samples and in those cases representing more than 50 of the clay fraction Fig 6B Sepiolite is rare being present preferentially in fascicular calcite crusts where it is present in less than 10 of the samples and representing 1 10 of the clay fraction or in Mg claystones with spherulites present in less than 5 of the samples and representing 1 10 of the clay fraction It is absent in the other facies Fig 6B Non magnesian clay minerals are mainly illite smectite and illite These clays occur in small quantities in about 50 of all the samples except for the laminites where illite smectite is only present in 15 of the samples but representing more than 50 of the clay fraction 4 3 Facies and clay mineralogy 4 3 1 QEMSCAN analysis The mineralogical composition of 92 samples from 5 wells located in different structural positions has been mapped using the QEMSCAN system The samples consist mainly of calcite dolomite quartz and Mgclays the latter varying significantly in proportion depending on the well position in the study area reaching a maximum of 50 in distal wells The sum of the trace minerals represents average quantities of 3 and the most common are presented in Fig 5 4 3 2 XRD analysis Clay minerals occur in different proportions in the described facies but also with

A M Almeida Carvalho et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 141 2022 105708 can be seen in up to 10 of the samples calcite crusts and intraclastic grainstones Fig 8G and H The pro portions are similar in both facies Table 1 and quartz as a pore filling phase is present in 40 of the fascicular calcite crusts samples and in 35 of the grainstone samples 4 4 3 Silica Silica is common in the BVF and displays four main different fabrics Crypto to microcrystalline silica is the most frequent silica phase forming drusy aggregates that partially to totally silicified calcite spherulites Fig 7B and mimetically replaced Mg clay matrix The silica replacement can be fabric selective e g it is confined within selected grains or non selective Fig 8G This phase can also fill growth framework porosity between fascicular calcite crusts Fig 8H Reworked silicified spherulites and intraclasts in the grainstone facies tend to indicate an early process of silicification Microcrystalline silica is generally associated with microporosity Quartz rims 20 50 μm thick are observed locally forming coatings around grains made of prismatic to bladed crystals Fig 8C and I These rims predate the development of coarse crystalline mosaic calcite Fig 8C The similar crystalline fabric scale occurrence in grainstone facies suggest a possible replacement of calcite rims by silica The third type is macro crystalline quartz composed of subhedral to anhedral crystals 30 100 μm in diameter that form a coarse mosaic cement filling pores Fig 8I and also observed as fracture infills It is unclear if this phase may also be replacive Last a chalcedony phase with a fibrous radiated fabric is observed and partially engulfs and replaces the coarse crystalline mosaic and the blocky calcites Figs 8E and 9A The laminites contains the largest amount of silica primarily as a replacement phase being present in 70 of the samples Supplementary material Fig A4 Centimetric tabular laminae and nodules of silica evolved in a few cases to pervasive silicification Microcrystalline quartz is the most common silica form in laminites followed by chalcedony and macrocrystalline mosaic quartz The replacement of Mg clays and calcite spherulites by silica is also frequently observed and occurs mainly as microcrystalline and macro crystalline mosaic quartz In the Mg claystones with higher spherulite contents silicification is observed in 75 of the samples In the fascic ular calcite crusts the replacement reaches a maximum of 65 of the samples but in general the proportion per sample is low with an average of 4 Chalcedony is accessory and mainly replaces spherulites and fascicular calcite As for calcite pore filling silica is more important in the fascicular 4 4 4 Minor diagenetic phases Minor occurrences of replacive and pore filling minerals including barite celestite cryolite dawsonite fluorite illite smectite kaolinite and magnesite have been observed Table 1 Magnesite dawsonite and barite are the most frequent Magnesite is present in 25 of the Mgclaystones with spherulites and occurs as lamellar aggregates replac ing and filling shrinkage pores in the Mg clays Dawsonite occurs mostly associated with fascicular calcite crusts and spherulites Fig 9B and barite occurs mainly as a cement phase in intraclastic grainstones and fascicular calcite crusts Fig 9C 4 4 5 Dissolution and fractures Secondary porosity is generated by the dissolution of both Mg clays and carbonate constituents Dissolution of carbonate intraclasts gener ated intraparticle and moldic porosity on intraclastic grainstones Fig 8B In fascicular calcite crusts dissolution generated intraframework porosity In these facies the enlargement of interparticle and growth framework pores is also common creating larger vugs Fig 9D In laminites facies a matrix microporosity is observed Fig 9E as well as a fenestral porosity locally enlarged due to disso lution In Mg claystones porosity formation is specially related to Mgclay dissolution Fig 9F although the dissolution of spherulites is significant in some samples Dissolution of pore filling calcite cement phase is common generating intracrystalline porosity Porosity gener ated by dissolution is observed in different proportions in all the facies although preferentially affecting fascicular calcite crusts Mg claystones with spherulites and intraclastic grainstones Table 1 Late cement phases filling secondary dissolution pores are often observed mainly in fascicular calcite crusts and Mg claystones with spherulites In fascicular calcite crusts late cements can consist of 35 of dolomite and 25 of calcite Fractures are observed mainly in intraclastic grainstones and fascicular calcite crusts and are frequently filled by a cement of quartz and calcite However the occurrence in the samples is local Fig 9 A Grainstone with coarse mosaic calcite replaced by chalcedony crossed polarized light XPL B Fascicular calcite

structure of the Santos Basin They interpreted the predominance of Mg smectite stevensite in the lower part of the stratigraphic succession as due to early evaporative conditions while the precipitation of kerolite in the upper part would be related to the presence of relatively more diluted waters Stevensite stability is favored by high salinity and pH and low to moderate Si Mg ratios while the kerolite stability is favored by moderate salinity pH between 8 and 8 5 and low Si Mg ratio with transitions from one to the other represented by kerolite stevensite interstratified minerals Gala n and Pozo 2011 Tosca and Masterson 2014 even suggested a broader range of pH for kerolite formation reaching higher values of 9 4 In this case the Si Mg ratio would be one of the main factors for kerolite precipitation According to these obser vations the Mg clays trend could indicate a variation in the detrital contribution in the basin since kerolite formation is favored in envi ronments with low detrital sediment input Deocampo 2015 This hypothesis is supported by the detrital grain abundance increase in Unit 3 and distribution of the grainstones with siliciclastic volcanoclastic grains that are observed in Units 3 and 2 in the vicinity of the structural high directly overlying the fractured substratum explaining the abundance of volcanoclastic siliciclastic material The sources of sol utes in the pre salt lake are not evident with potential sources including leaching and erosion of flood basalts outside the rift enhanced by hy drothermal activity Szatmari and Milani 2016 Farias et al 2019 intrabasinal magmatism Szatmari et al 2016 Wright 2022 felsic rocks from the basement in contact with groundwaters Pietchz et al 2018 marine seepage through the Walvis Ridge volcanic barrier Farias et al 2019 mantle exhumation and serpentinization Tosca and Wright 2015 Pinto et al 2017 Lima et al 2020 Despite the low proportion of terrigenous input in the basin the higher contribution of detrital grains in Unit 3 and its progressive decrease indicates a change in the lake s water recharge pattern that could influence the Mg clays type precipitation A higher amount of non magnesian clay minerals observed in laminites intraclastic grainstones and Mg claystones with spherulites can also be associated with areas and periods characterized by higher detrital input From a spatial point of view the facies with the largest preserved Mgclay content predominate in lower areas away from the structural high and in relative lows within the high as in the case of well W4 In these areas Mg clay occurs as very fine laminated fabrics associated with a low amount of spherulites On the contrary the wells of transects A and B located on the structural high as well as on its eastern flank transect C are characterized by very low content of Mg clays which occurs mainly as intraclasts and ooids Such differences could be due to a sys tem of different small and isolated lakes with no or only episodic lateral connection Farias et al 2019 However the lateral continuity of the different seismic reflectors and stratigraphic units of the BVF Wright and Barnett 2017 point to a unique large lake at least at field scale Changes in hydrodynamic conditions are supported by the very fine laminated fabrics deposited and well preserved in low energy environ ments localized in lower areas and ooids associated with high energy conditions predominating in higher areas of the depositional profile Lima and De Ros 2019 Basso et al 2020 Carramal et al 2022 The scarcity of Mg clays in these settings could also be related to lesser preservation and a stronger diagenetic alteration owing to variable physico chemical conditions in such places The high sensitivity of Mg clays to pCO2 and pH their high reactive surface area and their Al free composition can lead to their destabilization replacement and dissolution during early diagenesis Deocampo 2005 Tosca 2015 Tosca and Wright 2015 Fluctuations in environmental conditions probably favored distinct Mg clay minerals in time and variable types and degrees of alterations Carramal et al 2022 The decrease of Mg clays amounts in the high areas of the depositional setting and particularly in Unit 1 coincides with an increase of dolomite and magnesite amounts which suggest more intense replacement processes The diagenetic alterations of Mg clays and their relationship with other minerals will be discussed below 5 1 2 Fascicular calcite crusts Fascicular calcite crusts or shrubs from the Barra Velha and Mac abu Formations have been illustrated in several publications Herlinger 19

A M Almeida Carvalho et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 141 2022 105708 between spherulites and fascicular crusts The interlayering between fascicular calcite crusts and intraclastic grainstones point to rapid changes in hydrodynamic conditions In the same way the centimetric alternation of fascicular calcite spherulites and Mg clays observed in this study seems to reflect local and rapid changes in the lake chemistry and hydrodynamism Gomes et al 2020 Lima and De Ros 2019 Mercedes Martín et al 2019 An alternative hypothesis based on sedimentological observations suggests that shrubby carbonate formation might arise from the com bination of changes in the hydrodynamic conditions and microbial in fluence either in natural hot spring deposits Erthal et al 2017 but also in anthropogenic hyperalkaline saline environments Bastianini et al 2019 Experimental data suggest that the incipient formation of verti cally stacking spherulitic calcite resembling pre salt fascicular calcite habits requires both the intervention of highly supersaturated waters and the presence of microbial derived polymers Mercedes Martín et al 2021a b It was not possible to decipher such microbial influence in our study At field scale fascicular calcite crusts are observed in the three successive units in quite similar proportions Table 2 with a slight increase in Unit 1 They also gradually expand away from the structural high from base to top of the succession Fig 4 This observation can be compared with the aggrading and subsequent prograding geometries with a gradual flattening outward geometry of clinoforms observed on seismic by Minzoni et al 2021 They interpreted these features as a basinal shallowing upward with the filling of accommodation and the development of laterally extended shallow high energy settings The moderate to high δ18O values observed for fascicular calcite crusts in Units 2 and 1 are also suggestive of a progressive increase of the evap oritic conditions toward the end of the BVF deposition which would lead to highly carbonate saturated lake waters The rather constant δ13C values compared to the larger range of δ18O values Fig 16 indicates long water residence times in the paleolake equilibrium between at mospheric and lake water CO2 and evaporative conditions Pietzsch et al 2020 conditions Pietzsch et al 2020 The exact timing of spherulite formation relative to Mg clay pre cipitation is also debated Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 proposed the precipitation and deposition of an initial Mg silicate gel its subsequent crystallization to different types of Mg clay in which the spherulites would grow and be potentially re worked Based on the strong parallel orientation of the laminated deposits on their common association with siliciclastic particles and mud and on the deformation of the Mg clay laminae by the very early precipitation of the spherulites we inter preted that they precipitated within an already formed Mg clay fabric following the work of Carramal et al 2022 It must be noted that based on experimental observations Mercedes Martín et al 2016 suggested that silicate gels might not be required to encourage the for mation of polycrystalline calcite grains which otherwise can be the product of interference with organic acids The amounts of calcite spherulites shrubs and Mg clays in the different facies are apparently controlled by the intensity of the Mg clay alteration processes in the higher and lower areas related to different hydrodynamic conditions and intensive dissolution processes Indeed we observe that the transitional and higher areas of the depositional profile show low or absence of Mg clays content and a higher proportion of spherulites In this setting the dissolution of Mg clays could be related to lake level fluctuations with rare potential subaerial exposure suggested by the flat pebble breccia and teepee structures observed in laminites facies or to the dilution of lacustrine waters by meteoric influx Lima and De Ros 2019 Carramal et al 2022 Mg clays dissolution is also important in the wells located on the flank and in well W6 locations characterized by the presence of faults Fig 12 Such areas would be more prone to CO2 input by magmatic and hydrothermal activity Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 and to early diagenetic dissolution Conversely greater accumulation and preservation of Mg clays is observed in the northwest area characterized by a lower structural position and by rare faults Dissolution is a critical process of porosity generation in BVF deposits Tosca and Wright 2015 especially in the Mg claystones with spher ulites that originally presented a poor reservoir quality In addition the Mg clay dissolution could play a key role in later diagenesis Tosca and Wright 2015 Carramal et al 2022 The release into the system of Mg2 SiO2 and minor Na would favor the precipitation of dolomite silica and Na silicates Tosca and Wright 2015 This is supported by the diagenetic features observed in the study area The distribution of dissolution and dolomite in the Mg claystones share a similar increasing trend Table 5 towards transitional and higher areas In particular medium crystalline mosaic dolomite is the most common dolomite fabric on the structural high with a maximum observed in Unit 1 5 2 Early diagenetic phases Syngenetic and eogenetic processes occur in close association in the pre salt deposits The initial composition constituted mainly by Mgclays and fascicular calcite is one of the factors influencing the diage netic modifications and resulting products Herlinger et al 2017 5 2 1 Spherulites and Mg clay preservation Spherulites are very common and abundant in the BVF throughout the entire basin The formation of calcite spherulites is a subject of discussion having been interpreted as a result of 1 biotic primary precipitation associated with microbial processes Chafetz et al 2018 Kirkham and Tucker 2018 and 2 eodiagenetic products replacing and or displacing the laminated Mg clays Wright and Barnett 2015 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Carramal et al 2022 In our study spherulites appear in three sub facies Mg claystones with low and with high proportions of spherulites and grainstones These facies are characterized at certain locations of the depositional profile by moderate to intense dissolution of the clay matrix Fig 9F generating porosity This is in line with the observations of Wright and Barnett 2020 who recognized three different associations of spheru lites in the BVF 1 in association with Mg clays 2 with fenestral porosity lacking Mg clay and 3 as re worked deposits Moreover the spherulites observed in our study frequently display inclusions of Mg clay with a displacive growth that locally deformed the Mg clay laminations These observations support a secondary diagenetic origin for the spherulites rather than primary syngenetic precipitation The similar δ13C and δ18O range of values than for fascicular calcite also indicate long water residence times in the paleolake and evaporative 5 2 2 Dolomite After the calcite spherulites and shrubs dolomite is an important diagenetic mineral phase identified in the BVF sediments occurring more as a replacement phase than as a pore filling cement The different fabrics observed can be associated with distinct timings The lamellar dolomites magnesites which mimic shapes of Mg clays laminations plates are one of the specificities of the pre salt sag deposits Wright and Barnett 2020 Carramal et al 2022 These lamellar ag gregates were associated with highly evaporative conditions as attested by the presence of magnesite which requires highly concentrated waters Farias et al 2019 Carramal et al 2022 suggested that they initially formed filling shrinkage pores generated by Mg clays dehydration or by its replacement by kerolite The well expressed pseudomorphosis of the Mg clay laminae suggests very early diagenesis prior to any significant compaction that would have closed the shrinkage porosity Another recurrent form of dolomite is the microcrystalline dolomite occurring mainly in the transition zones and Unit 1 largely associated with laminites facies It is often observed as a replacement of Mg clays and commonly occurs in association with crypto to fine crystalline calcite Dolomite samples of the laminites facies show lower ranges of 21

values compared to calcites sampled in the same facies and to dolomites sampled in other facies This may point to episodic changing environmental conditions and more diluted waters leading to Mg clays replacement In our case study the microcrystalline dolomite is precisely observed in the uppermost part of the BVF and associated with crenulated laminites generally interpreted as microbial in origin Sartorato 2018 Artaga o 2018 Given these two points the role of biological processes in its formation cannot be totally discarded The rhombohedral dolomite is predominantly found associated with fascicular calcite crusts and spherulites often floating in the intersti tial space among the calcite shrubs and spherulites This dolomite fabric concentrates mainly in lower areas and Unit 2 reflecting their close association with Mg clays In their depositional model for the BVF Farias et al 2019 proposed an alternative model for the formation of dolomite rhombs According to them the beginning of the evaporation process would result in precipitation of fascicular calcite at the sediment water interface and precipitation of rhombohedral dolomites at the brine air interface which would then accumulate at the bottom of the saline lake With progressive evaporation of the CaCO3 rich waters increasing the Mg Ca ratio into the systems the dolomitization of the Mg clay matrix occurred Farias et al 2019 This would result in the deposition of levels of fascicular calcite crusts alternated with levels of dolomite rhombs and not in the observed distribution of rhombs floating in the interstitial spaces among shrubs Moreover this would not explain the dolomite distribution associated with the spherulites Finally in these facies the isotopic values observed for dolomite show a similar range of δ18O values but lower δ13C values compared to calcite of the same facies which is not the expected behavior for a continuous increasing evaporation of the lake waters Given these observations the rhombohedral dolomite likely results from the partial replacement of Mg clays before their subsequent dissolution Herlinger et al 2017 laminites associated with the presence of replacive microcrystalline dolomite or calcite and their respective isotopic signatures see above also suggest the alternation of freshening evaporation lake conditions Wright 2022 or reduced infiltration to sub bottom aquifers Merce des Martín et al 2019 Alternatively a hypothesis of precipitation as a syngenetic phase is addressed in Sartorato et al 2020 with the cryp tocrystalline silica resulting from organo mineralization processes However in the study area this silica phase is rarely found 5 3 Mesogenetic phases and hydrothermal processes In our case study the higher areas and southeast flank show a sig nificant dolomitization process evidenced by the increase of pervasive mosaic dolomite especially within in situ facies Mg claystones with spherulites laminites and fascicular calcite crusts The higher occur rence of dolomite associated with a decrease in the amount of Mg clay may again suggest the replacement of Mg clay by dolomite However petrographic observations i e Fig 7E H showed that the granular mosaic dolomite can also replace pervasively fascicular calcites and spherulites grow as a pore filling cement in the primary porosity mostly associated with grainstones or also co occur with macro crystalline quartz as fracture infill This indicates a late eogenetic to mesogenetic timing Total replacement of the original carbonate fabrics is frequently observed Moreover intervals with macrocrystalline quartz and coarse blocky calcite cement are recurrent The depositional texture exerted a strong control on the diagenetic modifications Herlinger et al 2017 Grainstones and fascicular calcite crusts exhibit heterogeneous cemen tation and more dissolution features as the initial porous systems of these sediments may have facilitated fluid circulation As faults are more common in those areas the structural pattern apparently acted as a major controlling factor The greater intensity of such diagenetic alter ations as well as the presence of saddle dolomite could be related to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids along those fractured zones However extensive hydrothermal processes like those reported in other portions of the Santos and Campos Basin Vieira de Luca et al 2017 Lima et al 2020 were not found in the study area Silicification has no peculiar spatial distribution and does not exhibit features indic ative of hydrothermal events as described in the coeval succession of the Pa o de Açucar area of Campos Basin Vieira de Luca et al 2017 or the Parque das Baleias area of Northern Campos Basin Lima et al 2020 Isotopic ratios do not point either to an important hydrothermalism diagenetic overprint given the relatively high and positive values Mineral phases such as macrocrystalline calcite saddle dolomite barite celestine and fluorite characteristic of hydrothermal alteration of the pre salt formation in the Campos Basin Lima and De Ros 2019 have been only observed in a very low proportion in the study area The QEMSCAM and XRD analyses also show that these minerals occur only as minor or even trace amounts Among the mentioned minerals saddle dolomite is the most prominent and although it is not by itself indicative of hydrothermal processes it is often associated with wells located in fault zones suggesting hydrothermal influence Herlinger et al 2017 Hydrothermal activity contributed only locally to the alteration of the pre salt carbonates and to the precipitation of specific mineral 5 2 3 Silica Early diagenetic silica occurs mainly as nodules Fig 3G layers and pervasive microcrystalline quartz Despite the limited amounts of silica observed in the petrographic descriptions it is more common in Unit 1 where it is a relevant component in XRD analyses Fig 16 The origins and timing of silica in the BVF are debated Various forms of silica have been identified in the pre salt formations of the conjugate South Atlantic margins in Brazil offshore Santos and Campos Basins and Angola Kwanza and Namibe Basins In the Kwanza Basin the original carbonate deposits suffered important diagenesis where silica metasomatism plays a key role with 1 early replacement and cemen tation by silica at relatively low temperature 100 C 2 a second silica generation linked to high temperature hydrothermal processes Tritlla et al 2018 Teboul et al 2019 In the Campos Basin Pa o de Açúcar pervasive silicification of the original carbonates attributed to a late hydrothermalism phase that generated corrosion porosity forma tion and silica replacement and precipitation Vieira de Luca et al 2017 Finally eogenetic silica precipitation has been interpreted as Mg clays replacement Lima and De Ros 2019 Wright and Barnett 2020 linked to freshening lake periods when relatively lower alkalinity values would favor its precipitation Wright and Barnett 2020 The higher proportions of silica in Unit 1 and especially within 22

J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Reservoir compartmentalization comprises one of the fundamental risks to the delivery of today s production and the development of up coming fields Fox and Bowman 2010 This phenomenon has an impact across the full exploration and production value chain from in place volume estimation recoverable reserve evaluation and infrastructure planning to project economics Chen 2013 Therefore recognizing and comprehending reservoir compartmentalization during the appraisal or early stages of field development is critical in preventing asset value erosion by driving up costs or introducing significant development risk which can lead to project failure in extreme cases Fox and Bowman 2010 Due to the absence of dynamic production data identifying reservoir compartmentalization during early field history is challenging Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 requiring multi disciplinary analysis to maxi mize the synergy of available static subsurface data The pre production compartmentalization assessment has been proved to be assertive in case studies the most common static data used are variations of petro leum fingerprints and PVT properties Smalley and England 1994 Pe ters and Fowler 2002 Weissenburger and Borbas 2004 Milkov et al 2007 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 water geochemistry Gill et al 2010 Permanyer et al 2013 static reservoir pressure and petroleum water contact Smalley and Hale 1996 Milkov et al 2007 Tozer and Borthwick 2010 Belhouchet et al 2021 conceptual geological models and fault sealing analyses based on seismic and well logs data McKie et al 2010 Scott et al 2010 Tozer and Borthwick 2010 Wonham et al 2010 Because no single static data set analysis can forecast the compartmentalization phenomenon a thorough inte gration of existing data is recommended to reduce and quantify reservoir connection uncertainty Milkov et al 2007 After 16 years of exploratory efforts more than 240 wells drilled and the discovery of one of the world s largest oil provinces the pre salt play remains an extremely attractive business Mello et al 2021a However as exploration campaigns in the Santos Basin progressed the scenario became more challenging due to a decrease in more evident and low risk opportunities Rostirolla et al 2021 necessitating a better under standing and awareness of the geological uncertainties surrounding the pre salt exploratory play Among the causes of uncertainty for petro leum system elements proposed by Rostirolla et al 2021 reservoir heterogeneities and connectivity are one of the main factors affecting reservoir risk The aim of this paper is to comprehend the uncertainty and estimate the degree of compartmentalization in a complex carbonate reservoir of the Brazilian pre salt play using pre production static data To clarify this issue we used the intriguing Iara Cluster of the Santos Basin as a case study The pre salt carbonate reservoirs are characterized by the faciological Wright and Barnett 2015 Abelha and Petersohn 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Azere do et al 2021 depositional Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Farias et al 2019 Minzoni et al 2021 de Carvalho et al 2021 Wright 2022 and diagenetic Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 complexity which is responsible for great lateral and vertical heterogeneities This scenario is susceptible to the formation of static and or dynamic intraformational seals which can act as flow barriers within the reservoir enabling the segregation of the hydrocar bon accumulation The method performed for compartmentalization modeling comprises the integration of a conceptual geological model of the Iara Cluster based on seismic facies interpretation with basic pet rophysical analysis geopressure fluid molecular composition and PVT properties interpretations Furthermore as an impact of low permeability zones several step ping oil water contacts can coexist in the same reservoir segment in a static and stable manner due to the static perched water effect Rolfsvåg and Danielsen 2016 This phenomenon is defined as movable water above the transition zone that is not directly connected to the actual free water table of a given hydrocarbon column and occurs when satu rated conditions above a low permeability layer force the water to move vertically Gaafar et al 2016 Similar to reservoir compartmentalization the implication of perched water zones is the misunderstanding of reservoir behavior leading to an incorrect esti mation of stock tank oil in place reserve evaluation well placement and completion design all of which can cause the propagation of potential expenditure for field development Gaafar et al 2016 Rolfsvåg and Danielsen 2016 Our study discusses the perched water phenomenon in the same reservoir segment based on the recognition of significant over pressured water zones Then the results and discussion raised by this study contribute to de risking the reservoir quality in new explo ration ventures in stratigraphic structural pre salt prospects as well as reinforcing the importance of an integrated multidisciplinary evaluation of static data to predict the early field development reservoir segments and consequently prevent asset value erosion 2 Geological and exploratory background 2 1 The Iara Cluster The Iara Cluster is a massive pre salt structure with more than 300 km2 of extension in the northeast portion of the Santos Basin Fig 1A which encompasses three of the biggest accumulations of the basin Sururu Berbiga o and Atapu The first exploratory efforts in this area started in June 2000 with the concession of the BM S 11A block from the 2nd Bidding Round under the Concession Regime This was before the consolidation of the pre salt as a play in the Santos Basin The block is currently operated by a consortium between Petrobras 42 5 Shell 25 Total 22 5 and Petrogal 10 Later in September 2008 the well 1 BRSA 618 RJS discovered the Sururu accumulation However at the time this discovery was interpreted as a non segmented mega structure called Iara spanning the entirety of the Iara Cluster This was due to the poor quality of the seismic imaging and the almost complete absence of well data GaffneyCline 2010 In April 2012 the Berbiga o accumulation was discovered by the 3 BRSA 1032 RJS well Both of those accumulations extended outside the limits of the BM S 11A block into an area not yet contracted Therefore the Brazilian government decided to include an additional block called Entorno de Iara Iara Surrounding covering this area Unlike the BM S 11A block this block was contracted and operated by Petrobras directly under the transfer of rights regime Petrobras 2014 In May 2013 the Atapu accumulation was discovered by the 1 BRSA 1146 RJS well inside this new block Later an extension of this structure to the eastern area of the BM S 11A block was confirmed by the 3 BRSA 1243 RJS well Petrobras 2014 The Brazilian government offered the Atapu ring fence through the transfer of rights surplus regime in 2021 which was acquired by a consortium formed by Petrobras 52 5 Total 22 5 and Shell 25 The Atapu ring fence is therefore subject to both the transfer of rights and the transfer of rights surplus regimes In summary as a result of the exploratory campaign in the Iara Cluster three different accumulations were discovered Berbiga o Sur uru and Atapu Petrobras 2014 Due to different kinds of E P regimes coexisting side by side these three accumulations ended up being divided into eight different ring fences for contractual reasons Fig 1B Berbiga o Sururu Oeste de Atapu West of Atapu Norte de Berbiga o North of Berbiga o Sul de Berbiga o South of Berbiga o Sul de Sururu South of Sururu Norte de Sururu North of Sururu and Atapu The first three ring fences are under a concession regime and the others are under a transfer of rights regime 2 2 General geological settings and tectono stratigraphic evolution of presalt sequence The formation of the Santos Basin began in the Late Jurassic with the destabilization and consequent fragmentation of West Gondwana that resulted in the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Early Creta ceous Heine et al 2013 Rigoti 2015 Dehler et al 2016 In this basin this process took place on a complex and heterogeneous basement 2

J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 m thick of coquinas was identified in Mero Field and interpreted by Barnett et al 2020 as a large bar produced through the reworking of bivalves from lower energy depositional environments by shore parallel currents Such deposits comprise the best reservoir facies shown by well 2 ANP 2A RJS Carlotto et al 2017 The top of the Itapema Formation is marked by a regional unconformity in the Santos Basin known as the Pre Alagoas Unconformity Moreira et al 2007 During the Aptian and within the Brazilian Alagoas Stage the main pre salt carbonate reservoirs of the Santos Basin were deposited belonging to the Barra Velha Formation BVE This formation is mainly lacustrine in origin and characterized by exotic carbonate texture as sociation which consists of in situ components described as fascicular calcite crystal shrubs calcite spherulites and mud as well as reworked facies derived from those carbonates Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Wright and Barnett 2017a Microbialites have also been described in the Barra Velha Formation However these facies are considered rare and are mainly located in the uppermost 20 30m of the formation Wright and Barnett 2015 2017a 2020 In addition in distal portions there is a predominance of shales and mudstones Moreira et al 2007 as evidenced by the well 1 BRSA 886 RJS with 300 m of continuous shale located in the flank of the main depocenter of the Santos Basin de Freitas et al 2022 There is also an intra formational unconformity named Intra Alagoas Unconformity dated 117 Ma based on the Ar Ar method in synchronous basaltic lava flow deposits Moreira et al 2007 Whilst in the top of this formation there is an unconformity that precedes the evaporites of the Ariri For mation named Salt Base characterized by an intense erosion process as described by Alves et al 2017 Magmatic events have been identified along all the pre salt sequence in the Santos Basin in addition to the Valanginian Hauterivian basalts of the Camboriú Formation subaqueous basalts are identified inter bedded with sedimentary rocks in the Piçarras and Itapema formations dated between 121 and 130 Ma and in the lower Barra Velha Formation dated at 128 Ma Moreira et al 2007 In the Libra Block Rancan et al 2018 and Penna et al 2019 identified different igneous suites with different ages and natures the first one comprises predominantly Bar remian Aptian tholeiitic basalts placed mostly in the Itapema Formation dated based on 40Ar 39Ar at 125 5 0 7 Ma whilst the second one comprises Santonian Campanian intrusive alkaline hypabyssal rocks placed predominantly on the top of the Barra Velha Formation and locally in the Itapema Formation In summary Fig 2 presents a simplified chronostratigraphic chart for the Iara Cluster 2 3 The Barra Velha formation depositional setting The genesis of the Barra Velha Formation and the Macabu Forma tion its equivalent in the Campos Basin has been the subject of intense debate in the geoscientific community owing to its unusual carbonate texture considerable thickness and the lack of more typical carbonate lake deposits Muniz and Bosence 2015 2018 Wright and Barnett 2015 2017a 2017b 2020 Wright and Tosca 2016 Ceraldi and Grenn 2017 Chafetz et al 2018 Pietzsch et al 2018 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 Azere do et al 2021 Barnett et al 2021a b de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 Most studies published agree about the overall depositional settings characterized by the non marine alkaline lakes However as pointed out by Azere do et al 2021 some points still have not reached consensus among geoscientists such as a the origin of carbonate fabric whether it is biotic biotic induced or abiotic b lake settings and their evolution over time c carbonate rock terminology and classification d genesis and significance of spherulites and the Mg rich clays The pre salt carbonates of the Santos Basin were deposited in a continentally proportioned lacustrine setting that exceeds the area of the modern lake Lake Tanganyika the largest rift lake in the world Pietzsch et al 2018 This palaeolake is defined as a closed endorheic environ ment Szatmari and Milani 2016 Farias et al 2019 which evolved for a long time completely disconnected from the oceans basically controlled by the catchment areas and subsurface recharge system input Pietzsch et al 2018 Inferences based on the use of seismic scale ge ometries such as clinoforms and draping as depositional relief proxies indicate significant bathymetry at the time of BVE carbonate deposition Buckley et al 2015 Minzoni et al 2021 In general large lacustrine systems can mimic the sequence stratigraphic architecture of marine settings except for the details of carbonate components and perhaps high frequency stratigraphy Minzoni et al 2021 Taking this into consideration Minzoni et al 2021 suggested that the primary controls on the large scale depositional architecture of continental carbonates from the Barra Velha Formation are the antecedent topography subsi dence patterns palaeowind direction and the production rate of the Fig 2 Simplified chronostratigraphic chart for the Iara Cluster in the Santos Basin with contribution from Moreira et al 2007 Buckley et al 2015

J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 carbonate factory which is affected by the carbonated fabric type and mainly the fluctuations in lake water chemistry On this basis Fetter et al 2018 highlighted the importance of the balance between the carbonate factory keep up and tectonic uplift related to elastic rebound and transpression features to control the depositional architecture of this palaeolake In the Santos Basin the complex basement topography framework derived from the multi phase oblique rift Zalan et al 2011 Rigoti 2015 process was induced by inheritance and reactivation controlling the architecture of the carbonate systems and consequently contrib uting to the control of its facies deposition Buckley et al 2015 Minzoni et al 2021 The carbonate sediments of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations were accumulated in shallow waters upon or around struc tural palaeohighs within a deep lacustrine depositional context where profundal facies were deposited on the structural depressions Buckley et al 2015 Fetter et al 2018 Neves et al 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Minzoni et al 2021 In contrast based on petrographic and geochemical analysis some studies Wright and Barnett 2015 2017b Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Wright 2022 Farias et al 2019 suggest an overspread shallow evaporitic and alkaline lake model for the Barra Velha Formation disregarding its possible rugged palaeotopography during deposition This interpretation is mainly supported by the regional correlation of the BVE shallow water facies characterized by the gamma ray log pattern known as Lula s Fingers or Marco Tupi observed in several wells across the Santos Basin which comprise on average 24 3 m defined by 9 gamma defined cycles and interpreted as one or more shallowing upward cyclothems Wright and Barnett 2017a 2017b Wright 2022 However two possible pitfalls can be addressed in this model a this model can be easily biased since the pre salt wells in those studies are derived from the structural highs of the Santos Basin which are related to shallow water platform settings owing to the current pre salt exploratory play Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 b the Marco Tupi facies are not related to the envi ronment described in the majority of the BVE carbonates and probably represent another depositional sequence associated with modified wa ters related to the first marine inflow in the basin de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 In addition Wright 2022 points out potential dif ficulties in interpreting seismic features due to the high structural complexity observed in basins containing BVE carbonates and their equivalents Among the processes mentioned Wright 2022 the extension discrepancy and polyphase faulting the effects of an outer margin collapse during the late Albian and the reactivation and sub sequent inversion of faults Alves et al 2017 could trigger a posterior deformation producing a relief at the top of the BVE unit which could be confused with depositional relief Despite the challenges behind the BVE and MCB carbonate charac terization and interpretation major advances have been made in the last decade Many studies Muniz and Bosence 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Tosca 2016 Gomes et al 2020 Azere do et al 2021 de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Wright 2022 described the high frequency cyclical nature of these deposits which in general are characterized by a shallowing upward increasing shrub stacking pattern composed of a transition from mudstone to spherulitestone and respectively to shrubstone Gomes et al 2020 and eventually to grainstones due to reworking processes Gomes et al 2020 based on the Farias et al 2019 model proposed a shallowing spherulite upward increasing facies stacking pattern in which the shrubstone facies tran sition to spherulitestone with Mg clay facies In order to explain the coexistence of both facies stacking pattern models Gomes et al 2020 interpreted that these variations are the result of the balance between the sedimentary input and the lake chemistry in different climatic con ditions the first being related to the transition from a humid to an arid environment and the second to a semi arid to arid environment Regardless the divergence of palaeobathymetric and depositional interpretation related to the BVE lake settings the published models converge approximately in relation to the spatial gross facies distribution Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Grenn 2017 de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 Whilst on the relative structural high position prevails the presence of reworked facies shrubs dominated sedimentary facies and travertine on the low structural position there is the occurrence of spherulite dominated facies mudstones and even shales according to the prevalence of rela tive deeper water settings 2 4 Hydrothermal activity evidence on pre salt carbonates Hydrothermal systems are sets of processes that redistribute energy and mass in the earth through the circulation of hot fluids laterally and vertically at various temperatures and pressures Norton 1984 Pirajno 1992 Pirajno 2009 The circulation of such hydrothermal fluids pro duces a complex process involving physico chemical changes in preex isting rocks known as hydrothermal alteration Pirajno 2009 Pirajno 1992 Other results of hydrothermal activity are subaerial and sub aqueous hot springs common in volcanic and tectonic lakes as well as on the seafloor along mid ocean ridges and in volcanic islands Those sys tems occur in areas of high geothermal gradients due to ongoing or re sidual magmatic or anomalous crustal conditions and as a result of anomalous heat flow due to high concentrations of radioactive elements in the crust Pirajno 2009 In continental settings those springs can produce travertine depositional environments related to hydrothermal vents fissure ridges rimstone dams pools and terrace features as well as tufa depositional environments Jones and Renaut 2010 de Filippis and Billi 2012 Renaut et al 2013 Mancini et al 2019 Evidence of syn and late hydrothermal systems has been reported in pre salt settings of the Santos and Campos Basins Alvarenga et al 2016 Herlinger Jr et al 2017 de Luca et al 2017 Oliveira and Rancan 2018 Lima and De Ros 2019 Lima et al 2020 The first piece of evidence is the hydrothermal alteration observed in the carbonates of the Barra Velha Ren et al 2019 and Macabu de Luca et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Lima et al 2020 formations characterized by hydraulic fracturing silicification dolomitization dissolution and precipitation of hydrothermal mineral phases such as saddle dolomite macrocrystalline calcite megaquartz sulfides and sulfates filling sec ondary porosity Lima et al 2020 due to the interaction between the hot fluids focused by fault systems and the preexisting rocks In northern Campos Basin based on petrographic characterization fluid inclusion analyses and isotopic analysis Lima et al 2020 identified a late stage deep burial hydrothermal alteration in carbonates related to the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene magmatic events and possibly the rising and exhumation of the asthenosphere in addition to the interaction with the granitic gneissic basement and the rift sedimentary succession In the northern Santos Basin Ren et al 2019 identified a hydrothermal alteration related to the existence of a multi stage magmatism mainly associated with Aptian and Santonian Campanian magmatic events through hydrothermal minerals and fluid inclusion analysis The second piece of evidence is hydrothermal vent systems that are defined by pipe like complexes formed by the fracturing transporting and erupting of hydrothermal fluids and sediments Planke et al 2005 These depositional features occur in association with travertine conti nental rift systems as observed in Lake Bogoria in the Kenya Rift Valley Renaut et al 2013 Those features are seismic scale and their recognition was discussed by Planke et al 2005 and Hansen 2006 which defined the seismic pattern of this structure related to intrusive events Hydrothermal vents have been broadly identified in the sedi mentary basins of the Brazilian eastern margin at different stratigraphic levels including in the pre salt section of the Campos and Santos basins Alvarenga et al 2016 identified several intrusive related hydrother mal vent complexes in the rift section of the Campos Basin Central platform Oliveira et al 2018 identified those complexes in the Eocene interval of the Espírito Santo onshore basin possibly related to the Abrolhos magmatic event Oliveira and Rancan 2018 also identified these features in the Aptian interval in the northern portion of the Santos

prop erties and fluids with similar fingerprints Milkov et al 2007 The first analysis performed consisted of the interpretation of seis mically imaged faults unconformities and seismic facies to comprehend the Iara structure in the pre salt interval The seismic interpretation was based on the identification and tracking of seismic reflectors correlated with key pre salt unconformities registered in well logs considering the amplitude continuity and reflector terminations The seismic facies were defined by the external geometry and reflection configuration identified and subsequently compared with seismic patterns described previously in the bibliography such as Mitchum et al 1977 Buckley et al 2015 Kattah and Balabekov 2015 Alvarenga et al 2016 Saller et al 2016 Ferreira et al 2019 Minzoni et al 2021 and Ferreira et al 2021 We carried out this analysis on two scales a Semi Regional in this step the basement and base of salt discontinuities were interpreted throughout the seismic volume in order to understand the structural and depositional context of the target of this study b Detailed in this stage beyond the interpretation of the Pre Salt key unconformities such as the base of salt Intra Alagoas Unconformity and Pre Alagoas Un conformity the recognitions and description of seismic facies was per formed as well as the analysis of RMS Amplitude Sweetness Variance and Isochore maps extracted from the surfaces mentioned The Base of Salt was interpreted as a high amplitude reflector characterized by a positive acoustic impedance reflector with high lateral continuity sparsely affected by faults which can be correlated regionally The Intra Alagoas Unconformity is a high positive amplitude fairly continuous moderately affected by faults and appears conform able in some palaeodepressions The Pre Alagoas Unconformity corre sponds to a low to medium amplitude discontinuous reflector intensively affected by faults The key seismic patterns identified in this study are illustrated and characterized in Table 1 Environmental setting depositional processes and lithology esti mation can be interpreted through the three dimensional relationship between seismic patterns Mitchum et al 1977 On this basis a con ceptual geological model of the Iara Cluster was created derived from the integration of the spatial distribution of the seismic facies associa tions observed throughout the Barra Velha formation geometry of the main unconformities and lacustrine carbonate depositional environ ment analogs described in Santos Campos and Kwanza Basin Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Grenn 2017 de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 This model was used to 3 Data and methods 3 1 Dataset and quality control The project database consists of a 3D seismic cube and data from 17 wells provided by the Exploration and Production Data Bank BDEP from the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels ANP The arrangement and location of the data used in this study are illustrated in Fig 1 The post stack depth domain seismic volume used in this study covers 3709 km2 including the Iara pre salt cluster Itapu as well as parts of the Búzios Mero and Se pia Oil Fields The average seismic resolution observed in the pre salt section is approximately 68 m Despite the presence of noise features such as diffraction geometries and acquisition footprints the volume in general expresses a good image quality enabling the recognition and interpretation of the main seismic patterns meeting the objectives of this work In addition we carried out a basic preconditioning workflow based on structural smoothing and filtering to improve the signal to noise ratio Of the 17 wells eleven are exploratory wells and the others are development wells The data used were well logs rock and fluid sample reports and when available basic petrophysical data reports We per formed a calibration of the Salt Base between the seismic surface and the formation tops This is necessary due to the uncertainty in the velocity processing model used to migrate the data The maximum and minimum deviations estimated are 64 and 60 m respectively with an average value of 21 7 m Moreover we correlated four wells from Iara s accu mulations with the seismic yielding a detailed analysis of the seismic facies 3 2 Methodology Reservoir compartmentalization modeling is a multidisciplinary approach to identify and characterize fluid units baffles and barriers within a reservoir before

J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Table 1 Iara Cluster carbonate seismic facies SF classification summary and interpretation qualitatively estimate the distribution of the large scale lithofacies variations and faults which are potential permeability barriers Observations of fluid related properties in different parts of the reservoir provide supporting evidence that there are physical barriers to the oil flow Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 Then the second step of this study consisted of a formation evaluation which encompassed qualitative analysis of well logs geopressure data analysis PVT prop erties and composition evaluation of fluids The well logs analysis enabled the identification of vertical permeability barrier zones and petroleum water contact The geopressure analysis used point static pressure measurements acquired by the modular formation dynamic tester MDT tool from eleven exploratory wells that tested the reservoir in virgin conditions enabling the estimation of fluid gradients and free water levels FWL In addition we analyzed 33 differential liber ation PVT property reports and 26 flash liberation PVT compositional analysis reports obtained via gas chromatography These reports con tained restricted data on the molecular composition and the fluid physical properties enabling a basic comparison between oils sampled in different wells Upon analysis there were only five carbon and hydrogen isotopic data from methane samples present in this dataset No individual analysis can provide a reliable prediction of reservoir compartmentalization Smalley and Hale 1996 Edman and Burk 1999 Raba a and Nagel 2004 Milkov et al 2007 Jolley et al 2010 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 Chen 2013 therefore a thorough integration 7

J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 of the data available and models built were performed in order to reduce uncertainties in the reservoir compartmentalization evaluation and es timate the potential flow barrier and baffle locations The integration tool applied in this study was the compartmentalization risk matrix CRM proposed by Milkov et al 2007 well as immediately next to the Iracema Fault System which is the NE trending continuity of the Outer Santos High Master Fault System Gomes et al 2012 The pre salt section is deposited in grabens half grabens and horsts underneath a thick evaporite sequence that exceeds 3 km in thickness As a result of a complex oblique sinistral extensional system locally represented by the sinistral shear zone related to the Helmut Anomaly Dehler et al 2016 the structural framework Fig 4 of this basin s segment is characterized by the in flection of the regional NE NNE trend observed in the Itapu Field to the overall NW trend in the Iara Cluster location which rotates back to the NE trend in the south near the Se pia Field The structural inflection areas exhibit a large scale flexural folding geometry conditioned by the 4 Results 4 1 Semi Regional structural context of Iara Cluster The Iara Cluster is located in the northeastern portion of the Santos Basin and in the north of the Helmut Anomaly Dehler et al 2016 as Fig 4 The Iara Cluster structural framework context A Regional basement map of Santos Basin Modified from de Freitas et al 2022 encompassing the main basin depocenters Main Depocenter North Depocenter and Central Depocenter structural highs and sub basin boundaries SWSB southwest Santos sub basin SESB southeast Santos sub basin from de Freitas et al 2022 the correspondent main oil kitchen Rostirolla et al 2021 the Helmut Anomaly Dehler et al 2016 B A detailed Iara Cluster basement map containing three interpreted cross sections A A B B and C C with emphasis on the spatial variation of the structural framework BBG Berbiga o SRR Sururu ATP Atapu 8

J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Cluster structure where Atapu uplifted horst is the most elevated structural high Berbiga o s rotated hemigrabens system occupies the deepest structural setting whilst the Sururu structure is in an interme diary zone Fig 5A Despite the influence of lower order cycles and post depositional fault systems there is a positive correlation between the Pre Alagoas Unconformity depth at present day and the mudcarbonate proportion ratio gathered from the composite logs Fig 5B Thus further fault activity in general preserved the overall stratigraphic architecture of the Iara Cluster during the Jiquia Stage in which deeper lake water conditions prevailed in Berbiga o and the western portion of Sururu whilst at the structural highs of the Sururu and Atapu shallower lake water setting prevailed enabling the deposition of coquina banks Fig 5A The Pre Alagoas Unconformity is predominantly conformable with the superior reflectors however there are local vestiges of erosion defined by angular and erosional truncation In the study area this seismic unit correlated with the Itapema interval is predominantly characterized by subhorizontal to horizontal parallel seismic patterns associated to continuous and high amplitude SF 1B in the Berbiga o and in the western Sururu low angle clinoform seismic patterns asso ciated to semicontinuous to continuous related to downlap termination and moderate amplitude SF 3 near the well 3 BRSA 891A RJS location in the southern slope of the Sururu and intensive sequence thinning associated to semiparallel to wavy seismic pattern and discontinuous reflectors with moderate to low amplitude on the top of the Atapu structure structural inheritance of the Proterozoic dextral transpressional Ribeira belt as shown by Matos et al 2021 This configuration results in a regional S shaped structural architecture in the eastern Santos Basin that is strongly influenced by a strike slip component The Iara Cluster comprises a vast four way structural closure at the Aptian level composed by three internal pre salt structural highs known as Berbiga o Sururu and Atapu separated from each other by extensive grabens associated with local relay ramps The regional bimodal struc tural framework trend is represented in the Iara Cluster two fault families are clearly observed characterized by a main NW trend asso ciated with a subordinate NE trend Fig 4 Despite the proximity of the fields a distinct structural architecture is observed The Berbiga o structural framework is mainly characterized by a depressed basement relief with thick syn rift filling associated with NW trending rotated hemigrabens with NE dip directions moreover secondary antithetic faults and NE trending faults are observed including NE sinistral strikeslip transfer faults The Sururu structural framework comprises an intermediary basement relief characterized by a sequence of interca lated NE trending horsts and grabens highly associated with relay ramps The Atapu accumulation is situated on top of an expressive rhombohedral shaped basement structural high formed by a trans pressive uplift caused by the accommodation of oblique rifting faults in the Helmut sinistral shear zone settings In the study area syn and post deposition faults were identified affecting all of the pre salt sequence The Itapema formation and lower rift intervals are structurally most affected indicating high tectonic activity Moreover expressive reactivated faults and growth faults were identified affecting the lower and upper Barra Velha formations indi cating the concomitance between sedimentary filling and structural activity Therefore the tectonic subsidence and its lateral variations along fault families were an important control of the BVE exotic car bonate deposition and facies distribution in Iara Cluster and conse quently in lateral variation of reservoir quality The reactivation of preexisting faults caused the structural inversion of certain fault families mainly in the Berbiga o and Sururu regions as well as at the inflection point of the regional structural trend as in the northwest of Atapu 4 2 2 Barra Velha formation The lower Barra Velha formation was sampled by all the wells in this study and is defined by the first occurrence of in situ carbonates Minzoni et al 2021 The few petrography reports available in the dataset describe the predominance of mudstone spherulitestone inter calation in this interval regardless of the wells structural position The upper limit of this unit is characterized by the Intra Alagoas Unconfor mity IAU which is represented by a regional trackable positive amplitude reflector The IAU structural map varies between 5140 and 6800 m and dis plays the same structural trend as the PAU structural map Fig 6A The thickness of the Lower Barra Velha formation Fig 6B varies greatly along the structural framework indicating the importance of tectonic control on the deposition and consequently in the facies distribution The highest values of thickness are associated with growth strata whereas the lowest values are related to erosional settings mainly observed in Berbiga o and Atapu The seismic unit corresponding to the Lower Barra Velha Formation is characterized by the lack of continuity and low amplitude contrast of seismic reflectors even resulting in a reflection free seismic pattern Fig 7 However locally there are continuous parallel patterns asso ciated with a medium to high amplitude in the Berbiga o Field and the western portion of the Sururu Field Also there are semiparallel discontinuous seismic patterns associated with onlap reflector termi nations in the northwestern portion of the Atapu Field The absence of seismic pattern diversity in the lower Barra Velha Formation could be associated with the facies homogeneity as shown by the petrography reports The co rendering of the amplitude seismic with the cosine of the phase attribute highlights the internal reflection of this unit reveals and enhances progradational clinoform seismic patterns in the north of Sururu Field and creates a backstepping pattern in the south Fig 7 The upper Barra Velha Formation comprises the interval above the IAU and is limited by the Base of Salt unconformity Moreira et al 2007 Buckley et al 2015 Carlotto et al 2017 Minzoni et al 2021 Ac cording to the petrography reports this unit mainly comprises a com plex stratigraphic succession characterized by cycles of in situ carbonates defined by mudstones spherulitestone shrubstone and reworked facies derived from these components Gomes et al 2020 as well as subordinary dolostone silexite and local occurrences of 4 2 Seismic stratigraphy interpretation of Iara Cluster As a result of the detailed interpretation and classification of seismic patterns differentiated by geometry and reflection character five main seismic facies were identified Tabular Mound Bank Chaotic Lens Filling There are important variations in the tabular seismic unit in relation to its structural position which motivated its subdivision Other seismic patterns with a smaller regional scope such as karst features were also recognized but were not mapped due to their scale The main seismic facies recognized and mapped of the Iara Cluster are summa rized in Table 1 4 2 1 Itapema Formation The Itapema Formation was sampled in 15 wells 4 in Berbiga o 3 in Sururu and 8 in Atapu As shown in previous work Moreira et al 2007 Carlotto et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 the Itapema Formation is constituted by the intercalation of coquinas and shales mudstones The transition between this unit and the Barra Velha Formation is defined by a funnel gamma ray pattern related to the occurrence of shales infor mally known as Jiquia in the most radioactive portion or by the occurrence of coquinas which is defined by a cylindrical gamma ray pattern De Freitas et al 2022 analyzed the organic geochemistry of well samples in the Santos Basin including the 1 BRSA 618 RJS 3 BRSA 891A RJS and 3 BRSA 1172 RJS from Sururu and Atapu fields and pointed out a high source rock interval potential with high content of TOC up to 15 9 and kerogen type I related to the Jiquia member interval The Jiquia Stage was highly affected and controlled by the tectonic activity related to the rift phase of the Santos Basin shaping the Iara 9

deposition of upper BVE carbonate towers were depos ited due to the outbreak of geothermal fluids possibly enriched in Ca 2 and HCO3 in the surface along reactivated deep seated faults The complex structural framework of the Iara Cluster influenced by a possible regional transfer zone probably focalized the occurrence of hydrothermal activity similar to other modern geothermal deposits Brogi et al 2014 DeMott et al 2021 The external geometrical result of those systems was diverse mound type deposits SF 2 distributed along the NE trending faults Fig 15 which are distinctly observed in the seismic section and constitute at least four main mound systems The wells that tested the carbonate reservoirs related to these mound fea tures found outstanding net pay and a high productivity index The central mound system in the Atapu area is dome shaped with flat lying basal concordance onlapping overburden relationship and chaotic internal geometry Fig 10 They are separated by a syn tectonic parallel geometry with high amplitude The northeast mound Fig 10 system is characterized by a dome shaped external geometry with a truncational basal relationship which could be a result of hydrothermal breccia deposits Planke et al 2005 and an onlapping overburden relationship as well as a downlapping internal geometry that indicates a possible NE progradation of the venting The high amplitude parallel seismic unit SF 1A onlaps this carbonate mound this contact can be a major reservoir property variation Travertine and carbonate breccia facies have been described in the 3 BRSA 1284 RJS lithology report associated with these seismic facies in the southeast area of Atapu The Sururu and Berbiga o twin mound systems occur in the western portion of the Iara Cluster separated from each other by an extensive graben Fig 9 The Sururu mound trend follows the S structural framework of the region culminating in a major mound feature in the Sepia Field that has been recently drilled and confirmed a discovery with an outstanding effective oil column Those mounds are character ized by a dome shaped external geometry associated with flat lying basal concordance onlapping overburden relationship and chaotic in ternal geometry Fig 9 In the Berbiga o area the basal concordance is characterized by an angular unconformity and the internal geometry locally exhibits aggradational internal convex upward reflectors which is highlighted by the contrast with the surrounding high amplitude parallel seismic unit The southwestern mound trend of the Sururu Field was drilled by the well 3 BRSA 1212 RJS which in wellcore photog raphy exhibits steep shrubstone crust possibly deposited in epigean conditions by the thermal water flowing from the vent along the lateral slopes or in hypogean conditions related to the infilling of vertical to the tectonic uplift and the aggradation stacking that control the rift lake setting as presented by Fetter et al 2018 Although this architecture has already been described in other portions of the Santos pre salt province Minzoni et al 2021 we cannot neglect the influence of seismic illumination and resolution in the interpretation of this feature Therefore we recommended that those patterns be confirmed in a higher resolution seismic dataset Tectonic reactivation increases from the IAU to the Base of Salt resulting in a variety of seismic patterns throughout the Upper Barra Velha Formation Throughout the BVE deposition the Atapu area has the highest relative relief Fig 8 It was most likely experiencing tec tonic uplift as a result of the restraining bend caused by the accommo dation of tectonic blocks in the Iracema transfer zone Fig 4 In this context a considerable thinning of this unit has been identified Fig 8 indicating a possible imbalance between uplift and carbonate fabric maintenance resulting in evaporitic concentration of the palaeolake as well as sub aerial exposition The predominant seismic pattern identi fied is a low amplitude discontinuous parallel seismic unit SF 1B which is interpreted as a shallow alkaline lake associated with strong reworking processes Fig 15 This interpretation is supported by the lithology descriptions of the wells 1 BRSA 1146 RJS and 3 BRSA 1284RJS which indicate the intercalation of shrubstones grainstones and rudstones as well as spherulitestones In contrast the other structures occupied relatively deeper alkaline lake settings compared with the Atapu area The Sururu area displays a predominance of an aggradational low amplitude parallel seismic pattern SF 1B associated with high internal reflector frequency on the top of the platform while the northwest portion exhibits a front slope fill pattern SF 5 characterized by an onlap surface that culminates below the seismic resolution Fig 7 and in the southeast there is a highangle slope defining an asymmetrical platform The petrography report and wellcore sample photography of the wells 1 BRSA 618 RJS 3BRSA 1181D RJS and 3 BRSA 891A RJS that drilled the seismic pattern appointed indicate the predominance of mudstones and spherulites along the Upper Barra Velha Formation Therefore we interpreted that Sururu represents an aggradational stacking of relative distal alkaline lacustrine carbonate deposits related to a cyclical platform drowning through the NW low angle slope in a proximal sublittoral environment The Berbiga o area represents an even further relative distal setting Fig 15 and it is characterized by a carbonate ramp platform restricted in the upper portions of a hemigrabens system surrounded by profundal deposits represented by the high amplitude parallel seismic pattern SF1A Reactivation and fault reversal is distinctly observed in the area which is interpreted with a major control on the subsidence and 16

J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Fig 15 Conceptual geological model for the Iara Cluster highlighting the potential zones of lateral property variation surfaces and structural lows can be a powerful tool for estimating the stratigraphic boundaries of carbonate buried relief prospects When the initial accumulation area estimated by GaffneyCline 2010 is compared to the accumulation area obtained in this study considering the strati graphic boundary 310 22 km2 a reduction of 55 7 is observed Furthermore the Sururu and Berbiga o accumulations echo the discov ery of the Pa o de Açúcar and encourage exploration to look beyond traps associated solely with four way closures at the Base of Salt and inves tigate stratigraphic and combined traps in the deepest portions of the BVE and MCB settings structural closure of the Sururu area is 130m above the oil water con tact In the Berbiga o area this relation is even more prominent almost 200m Therefore the stratigraphic framework plays a major role in the lateral stratigraphic entrapment of both areas As a result the reservoir s delimitation becomes a challenge which has a direct impact on the reserve estimation On the other hand the conceptual model built from mapping the spatial distribution of the seismic units can qualitatively indicate possible contacts between large scale domains with the pre dominance of the reservoir and non reservoir facies It is important to note that future quantitative interpretation analysis based on seismic inversion which increases seismic resolution and can be associated with rock properties could be decisive in consolidating or improving this model In the northern portion of the Sururu Field a high amplitude parallel seismic unit SF 1A of the Upper BVE onlap the low amplitude unit SF 1B creating a wedge shaped feature This feature is interpreted as the onlap of deep facies over the tight alkaline sublittoral carbonates of the Sururu area similar to what occurs at the Pa o de Açúcar discovery de Luca et al 2017 The occurrence of high amplitude parallel seismic units dominates structural lows which are characterized by local depocenters associated with graben and hemigrabens features although these features were not drilled in the area by public domain wells The well 1 BRSA 886 RJS drilled the flank of a regional depocenter in the Santos Basin and was located 63 m from the Iara Cluster revealing a predominance of shales along the BVE formation de Freitas et al 2022 in this setting In the Berbiga o the contrast between high amplitude parallel seismic units SF 1A and mounded patterns SF 2 or low amplitude parallel seismic units SF 1B is even more pronounced indicating that the lateral variation of the carbonate facies is possibly even more abrupt significant and indicates a greater presence of non reservoir facies along the platform areas stratigraphic stacking As a result of these findings we conclude that seismic pattern con trasts can be used to detect large scale lateral variation in carbonate facies depending on the scale of investigation In particular identifying high amplitude plane parallel seismic units associated with onlap 5 3 Reservoir compartmentalization of Iara Cluster Different causes and processes can trigger the phenomenon of reservoir compartmentalization Jolley et al 2010 The primary causes are structural and depositional flow barrier formations although facies variations diagenesis geochemical variation and non turbiditic events in siliciclastic systems can also result in reservoir zone dysconnectivity Chen 2013 However identifying and characterizing this phenome non is not an easy task considering that the analysis of any individual dataset can t reliably predict the compartmentalization of the reservoir Milkov et al 2007 This complicating factor stems from the inherent ambiguity in each type of pre production data s individual interpreta tion For example not all faults identified in seismic data are potentially sealants requiring the analysis of cross fault flow from the juxtaposition between reservoir and non reservoir rocks along the fault Jolley et al 2010 Similarly the presence of low permeability rocks in the field can act as vertical flow barriers only if they are laterally extensive and correlatable Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 Reservoir pressure can equilibrate over time through a common aquifer Westrich et al 1999 Milkov et al 2007 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 or a dynamic seal Jolley et al 2010 Different oil water contacts can be the result of a hydrodynamic aquifer Muggeridge and Mamode 2012 or the perched water phenomenon instead of compartmentalization Gaafar et al 2016 Rolfsvåg and Denielsen 2016 Macaluso et al 2019 20

J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Dissimilarities in fluid properties can arise from petroleum charge his tories Peters and Fowler 2002 Milkov et al 2007 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 or post accumulation processes such as thermal degradation Peters and Fowler 2002 Isaksen 2004 biodegradation Peters and Fowler 2002 Milkov et al 2007 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 and gravitational segregation Peters and Fowler 2002 Milkov et al 2007 Pomerantz et al 2010 Therefore the best approach to reducing uncertainty when addressing the reservoir connectivity issue is through data integration which can be interpreted in terms of risk as proposed by Milkov et al 2007 The reservoir compartmentalization matrix generated for the Iara Cluster is shown in Table 4 The complex tectonostratigraphic history in the Iara Cluster is characterized by indications of hydrothermal vents in the formation of the reservoirs tectono structural influence on the deposition of car bonates lateral facies variation associated with the transition from a shallow alkaline lake setting to a distal lacustrine environment and posterior reactivation of the structural framework Fig 14 This complexity contributes to the heterogeneity and abrupt contrast of permo porous properties in the reservoir The scenario is prone to the formation of regional and local static or dynamic seals that affect hy draulic communication between reservoirs The high heterogeneity of these reservoirs also reflects the sharp contrast of the productivity index in the wells within the Berbiga o Sururu and Atapu structures with an emphasis on the occurrence of the highest indexes when associated with mound features or areas with reworked evidence The main potential permeability barriers identified in the Iara Cluster were faults and fractures with a high density of occurrence primarily in the Sururu and Atapu areas the Jiquia shale a significant vertical permeability barrier identified in almost all wells and clearly identified in gamma ray and NMR porosity logs lateral facies variations in the upper Barra Velha system estimated by the abrupt contrast be tween the high amplitude plane parallel seismic facies SF 1A and the others particularly the carbonate mound unit the occurrence of filling seismic features SF 5 and in the hanging wall of syn depositional reactivated faults Therefore the occurrence of those features in the seismic data between the wells analyzed increases the risk of reservoir compartmentalization Table 4 The analysis of pre production reservoir pressure indicates hydraulic communication of the oil zone between the Atapu and Sururu reservoirs whose gradients are compatible with each other respectively 0 0777 and 0 0785 kgf cm2 Fig 11 Berbiga o area presents two different oil gradients 0 0809 and 0 0989 kgf cm2 Fig 11 The first is slightly similar to those identified in the Sururu and Atapu accumulations while the second is observed in a more distal setting structure distinctly hy draulically segmented from the others The density estimated from the oil gradient of the 3 BRSA 1032 RJS well presents values above the expected this result may be influenced by overpressured sampling points We observed irregular oil water contacts and free water levels along and between the reservoirs some of which are associated with the same oil zone In static pressure by depth graphs Fig 16 the water gradient line occurs parallel with a vertical shift related to the same oil zone This pattern not only occurs in the Iara Complex but also in the Mero Petersohn et al 2021 and Tupi fields Mello et al 2021b This arrangement can indicate the phenomenon of the perched water effect in the studied reservoirs It is defined as movable water above the transition zone that is not directly connected to the actual free water table of a given hydrocarbon column due to the local entrapment of connate water that forces the water to move vertically through the layer Gaafar et al 2016 Rolfsvåg and Denielsen 2016 Macaluso et al 2019 Therefore this effect is prone to occur when associated with rugged relief of the reservoir base Rolfsvåg and Denielsen 2016 characteristic of buried relief reservoirs and in carbonate mounds due to the influence of tight impermeable carbonate zones resulting from the depositional environment and diagenesis processes Gaafar et al 2016 Both situations are distinctly observed in the Iara Cluster Fig 16 not only in the hydrothermal mound alignments but also in the platform settings which can entrap the water during the drainage pro cess causing the occurrence of the perched water contacts However the high density of faults observed in Atapu Fig 16 together with the presence of the Jiquia shale vertically separating the reservoirs of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations makes this phenomenon more susceptible in the area Furthermore the distal context observed in Berbiga o Fig 16 with strong permo porosity contrasts along the BVE Table 4 Risk Matrix for the occurrence of compartmentalization inspired by Milkov et al 2007 Note that the level of dissimilarity between wells is directly proportional to the risk of reservoir segmentation 21

stratigraphic structural boundaries of the reservoir as well as the possible permeability barriers B Segmentation style observed in the study area Atapu Style hydraulic communication throughout all the oil zone with vertical oil composition pool segmentation in the 3 BRSA 1172 RJS due to the Jiquia shale permeability barrier the perched water effect is observed forming shifted parallel water gradients Berbiga o Style hydraulic compartmentalization between oil zones due to stratigraphic lateral variations resulting in different oil gradients reservoir also results in a considerable risk of this phenomenon occurring The oil component analysis mainly related to the gas associated with the single liquid hydrocarbon phase of those subsaturated reservoirs indicates important differences between the studied areas Figs 13 and 14 The reservoir connectivity risk factor is directly proportional to the degree of similarity between the compositions of the fluids sampled in different wells Table 4 The API degree of the oils sampled has similar values in the three areas with the exception of punctual samples from the Berbiga o and Sururu fields Fig 12 The Sururu area shows an increase in API degree values by depth indicating the presence of a compositional gradient of the oil column by gravitational separation Locally the same phenom enon possibly occurs in well 4 BRSA 1226 RJS in the southern portion of Berbiga o Because sample dissimilarity is related to the same composi tional gradient the post accumulation process of gravitational separa tion makes direct comparison of fluid samples difficult regarding compartmentalization identification The Atapu accumulation presents the highest saturation pressure values of the reservoir whereas Sururu presents intermediate values and Berbiga o presents the lowest values The saturation pressure is directly proportional to the solubility ratio thus resulting in a similar distribution of these properties There is a correlation between the values of the solubility ratio and the content of CO2 and C1 diluted in the reservoir Therefore the Berbiga o contrasts with the other reservoirs presenting much lower levels of CO2 contamination in relation to the Sururu and Atapu accumulations Internally in Berbiga o slight differences are observed between the oil obtained from well 3 BRSA 1032 RJS which was drilled into a structure in a more distal context and the oil obtained from the main structure The oil in the main structure presents higher values of the properties studied while its southern portion presents a possible compositional gradient In Atapu an oil sample extracted from the Ita pema Formation reservoir is distinctly different from the others The well log analysis shows the presence of a vertical permeability barrier above this reservoir characterized by the radioactive shale Jiquia which may be segmenting the different oil pools The differences in oil composition observed in the Iara Complex reservoirs are interpreted as a result of different petroleum charge his tories and post accumulation processes De Freitas et al 2022 when analyzing organic geochemical data from ten crude oil samples from the Santos Basin observed through the analysis of conventional biomarker source related parameters that the oil sampled from well 3 BRSA 1172 RJS Atapu location is quite similar to the 1 BRSA 618 RJS Sururu location oil sample This oil family indicates lacustrine freshwater to sub normal salinity conditions for the source rock de Farias et al 2021 which is interpreted as belonging to the Itapema formation mainly Rocha et al 2019 slight differences can be the result of distinct facies of the same formation due to salinity con dition variations Leite et al 2020 de Freitas et al 2022 The analysis of gas geochemistry proved to be a powerful tool for understanding the generation process thermal maturity and secondary alteration processes which provides inputs to reconstruct the reservoir accumulation history Lorant et al 1998 Prinzhofer et al 2000 Katz 2002 Santos Neto 2004 Milkov and Etiope 2018 Peng et al 2019 Souza et al 2022 The use of simple ratios of the molecular composi tion of gas C1 C2 C2 C3 C2 iC4 iC4 nC4 integrated with isotopic ra tios δ13C and δ2H can be used as a proxy for maturity estimation Lorant et al 1998 Katz 2002 Prinzhofer et al 2000 Peng et al 2019 Souza et al 2021 The molecular and stable isotopic composition of the associated hydrocarbon analyzed in this study suggests a thermogenic origin The methane origin diagrams based on δ13C C1 versus δ2H C1 and C1 C2 C3 of Milkov and Etiope 2018 support the interpretation of oil associated thermogenic gas related to the transition from an early to late maturation stage Fig 17 A and B The range of those properties analyzed in this study is consistent with the samples analyzed by Souza et al 2021 The Iara Complex samples show a clear trend of increasing maturity with the Berbiga o reservoir samples more closely related to the early mature thermogenic gas stage and the Sururu and Atapu samples more closely related to the late mature thermogenic gas stage The same trend is observed in the scatter plot of C2 C3 versus C2 iC4 Fig 17C for the Iara Complex samples based on Peng et al 2019 This suggests that the oil kitchen that fed the Berbiga o reservoirs had less thermal maturity than the Sururu and Atapu kitchen The permeability barrier characterized by an extensive NE SW graben located in the east of Berbiga o presents very high efficiency preventing the homogeniza tion and mixing of fluids between the reservoirs over geological time Sururu and Atapu reservoirs may have shared the same oil kitchen Understanding the timing of the reservoir s CO2 contamination is

correspond to the main effects that controls porosity generation and or obliteration and consequently ﬂuid movements in the reservoir Herlinger et al 2017 Gomes et al 2020 Leite et al 2020 Sartorato et al 2020 A unique feature of the Libra block and Mero reservoir is the abundant igneous rocks presence Penna et al 2019 Oliveira et al 2021 Extrusive igneous rocks are of Barremian Aptian age and mainly composed by tholeiitic basalts more commonly found below Itapema Formation Penna et al 2019 Intrusive igneous rocks are of Santonian Campanian ages mainly alkaline and can occur anywhere in the stratigraphy cutting surrounding rocks or concordant to the sedimentary layering e g top of the Barra Velha Formation The correct mapping and prediction of these rocks are very relevant for the characterization and management of the reservoir once they penalize the total oil in place volume they can act as ﬂow barriers or even high permeability layers if fracturing is high enough and contribute to the regional aquifer and pressure maintenance reservoir models Because of the FU incorporation difﬁculties and lack of correlation with lithological facies most 3D static models built from FU are merely a geostatistical procedure away from the well control without any lateral constraint of the facies interpolation Li et al 2017 Zhang et al 2018 However recent studies have incorporated seismic data into the FU modelling workﬂow for the FU interpolation Iravani et al 2018 considered the acoustic impedance as constraint for interpolation of petrophysical properties in a FU template Yarmohammadi et al 2014 Rastegarnia et al 2016 and Hatampour et al 2018 applied artiﬁcial intelligence to obtain linear relationships between FU and seismic attributes creating their constraints to the FU facies modelling Penna and Lupinacci 2021 used a cumulative S curve analysis to create a decametric FU rock typing and through a Bayesian probabilistic model performed 3D porosity and permeability adequate to the seismic acoustic impedance resolution All these seismic generated FU models can later be successfully incorporated in the static modelling workﬂow of the reservoir as hard constraints or secondary variable in co kriging techniques The usage of seismic attributes provides lateral control for FU interpolation away from the well and is especially relevant in large reservoirs with a reduced number of drilled wells However the vertical resolution of deterministic seismic inversion products is limited to the decametric scale above 20 m for Brazilian presalt reservoirs more details in Penna and Lupinacci 2021 In seismicincorporated FUs and ﬂuids movements detection the scale of observation is crucial as for instance porous fractured media will be more or less connected depending on the grid size Haridy et al 2020 Conventional methods of seismic facies classiﬁcation do not extrapolate the vertical resolution further from the input data limit Considering that most of the FU classiﬁcations are made in the core scale millimetric and transposed to well log scale centimetric then several upscale and downscale assumptions are needed to incorporate the decametric seismic results Penna and Lupinacci 2021 This paper proposes an approach to estimate seismic derived petrophysical property volumes at the metric scale Using data percentiles and a cumulative S curve from the core porosity and absolute permeability we calculated a signiﬁcant number of decametric and metric ﬂow units that correlates with seismic acoustic impedance and responds for both large and small scales ﬂow characteristics of the reservoir Within each iteration of decametric and metric ﬂow units from the geostatistical seismic inversion we co simulated petrophysical properties volumes that respect the well information in the metric scale and are laterally consistent with the local geology regardless of the input resolution limit 2 Study

R Penna and W M Lupinacci Petroleum Science 21 2024 1699e1718 1 Take all the core porosity and permeability measurements and calculate statistical relevant percentiles the number varies depending on the data characteristics Each percentile is a representative sample from a given interval 2 Calculate RQI and FZI values using Eqs 1 and 2 and the percentiles values 3 Order the data with increasing values of log FZI 4 Accumulate and normalize the percentiles of permeability values 5 Calculate the slope of the curve for each sample Fig 4 as decametric trend Fig 3 However our purpose here is to characterize higher orders of ﬂuid movements in the reservoir as metric ﬂow units using the acoustic impedance as constraints obtained from a geostatistical seismic inversion For this eight FU are considered as metric ﬂow trends green lines in Fig 3 SMLP are used in this work only as a visual guide for this scale dependence of the petrophysical properties The ﬂow unit discretization is performed in the core analysis using the rock quality index ﬂow zone indicator RQI FZI and then transposed to the well log data This method is based on permeability in mD and effective porosity fE ratio and derived from a generalization of the Kozeny Carmen equations Kozeny 1927 It was introduced by Amaefule et al 1993 and is widely used due to its simplicity and assertive results Let the index RQI reservoir quality index in mm be sﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ k RQI ¼ 0 0314 fE As described in the SMLP at least two scales of variations are observable in the derivative data Fig 3 one on a small scale higher order related to metric variations and other on a large scale lower order related to decametre variations Penna and Lupinacci 2021 chosen to interpretate the major jumps in the slope curve as the decametric ﬂow characteristics changes in the reservoir although this can be extended to many scales The lower scale of observation responds to low frequency variations in the SMLP and FZI S curve plots and higher order of variations responds to high frequency variations This was ﬁt for purpose as the scope of their work were to characterize ﬂow units in the decametric scale and then correlate with elastic attributes Given that the aim 1 where k is the absolute permeability in mD and fE the effective porosity Then the FZI is given by FZI ¼ RQI fZ 2 where fZ is an effective porosity normalization on the form fZ ¼ fE 1 fE Since its derivation from Kozeny Carmen equations FZI value is approximates an average pore throat radius for a given porous media relating effective porosity and permeability Different sedimentation environments late diagenetic processes and reservoir geometry are also controlling parameters of FZI Tiab and Donaldson 2004 Taking log on both sides of Eq 2 and rearranging it we verify the linearity between FZI RQI and fZ logRQI ¼ logFZI þ log fZ 3 In log log plot of the RQI versus fZ a constant value of the FZI produces an inclined straight line The inference is that samples with similar ﬂow behavior falls around a corresponding slope line determining a single ﬂow unit FU Samples with distinct ﬂow characteristics are plotted in different parallel lines and arrange distinct ﬂow units Different methodologies for clustering samples around FZI values and creating FU are available in the literature and applied in different geological scenarios In some cases a simple log FZI histogram discretization is enough to discretize the ﬂow units considering that the samples show strong FZI versus permeability correlation and a log normal FZI distribution More complex methods such as iterative multi linear regressions Al Ajmi and Holditch 2000 and normal probability plots cumulative distribution function Mahjour et al 2016 are also widely used especially in more complex geological settings Penna and Lupinacci 2020 2021 showed that the usage of percentiles and a cumulative S curve produced a signiﬁcant minimum amount of ﬂow units with statistical relevance without compromising the estimation of petrophysical properties This is particularly relevant to the scope of this study considering the amount of k and f measurements the high complexity degree of the Mero reservoir and the aim to correlate the FU to seismic data with respect to its vertical resolution limit The steps to construct the RQI FZI cumulative S curve as presented by Penna and Lupinacci 2021 are Fig 4 The log FZI S curve for MFU discretization Grey line corresponds to decametric FU classiﬁcation after Penna and Lupinacci 2021 and red line corresponds to metric FU classiﬁcation 1703

R Penna and W M Lupinacci Petroleum Science 21 2024 1699e1718 of the present study is to get a step further discretizing metric ﬂow units with the seismic data we interpret the major jumps in the slope plot ﬁrst order variation that corresponds to the decametric FU same as Penna and Lupinacci 2021 and the second order variation as the metric FU Using both effective porosity and permeability from the nuclear magnetic resonance NMR well logs the RQI FZI values are calculated for each well through Eqs 1 and 2 The discretization of the FU in the metric MFU and decametric DFU scales from the FZI S curve plot is shown in Fig 4 Eight metric ﬂow units are interpreted considering the changes in the FZI S curve slope Note that the number of metric ﬂow units correlates to the SMLP interpretation as a higher order variation from the decametric scale The cut offs in log FZI used for discretizing the ﬂow metric units MFU are shown in Table 1 The initial ﬂat segment parallel to the X axis of the FZI S curve Fig 4 describes FUs that have no contributions to the ﬂow behavior in the metric scale Therefore MFU1 and MFU2 are considered seals or bafﬂe zones that retain ﬂuid ﬂow acting as vertical and horizontal barriers In general rocks with reduced matrix porosity like igneous rocks cemented and clayey carbonates are into these units MFU3 is denoted by the initial detachment of the curve from the X axis and subsequently MFU4 Fig 4 These FUs have some ﬂow capacity but are very poor in terms of overall reservoir ﬂow behavior This is the typical behavior of carbonates with some late diagenetic effects like quartz and dolomite cementation obliterating the original matrix porosity of the rock Although not directly considered for production they are important for maintaining reservoir pressurization over production time MFU5 and MFU6 are the ﬁrst ramp up of the curve Fig 4 with better permoporous reservoir characteristics then the previous units Although some level of diagenetic effect can occur they will have considerable contributions to reservoir ﬂow during production Some bioclastic grainstones packstones and wackestones belongs to MFU5 and MFU6 for example The end of the curve corresponds to the better FUs in terms of permoporous characteristics MFU7 and MFU8 They have considerable porosity and remarkable ﬂow performance during production In general MFU7 and MFU8 correspond to clean calcite carbonates like bivalve rudstones coquinas from the Itapema Formation and shrubs and rework facies from the Barra Velha Formation with little or none late diagenetic effects Penna and Lupinacci 2021 Fig 5 demonstrates how the new classiﬁcation differs from the decametric ﬂow unit DFU considering the seismic vertical resolution limitation The relationship between DFU1 and MFU1 and MFU2 for instance are quite notable as the latter are a one step upscaling of the ﬁrst one The mean median and standard deviation of the acoustic impedance PI effective porosity f and Schlumberger Doll Research Al Ajmi and Holditch 2000 permeability k for each metric ﬂow units are displayed in Table 2 These calculations were performed using the well logs Note that the Fig 5 Application of log FZI cut off discretization in Well 6 using the effective porosity from the magnetic resonance data Lithologies on the left correspond to a simpliﬁed classiﬁcation for seismic facies analysis purposes after Penna et al 2019 overall values of the PI tend to decrease from MFU1 to MFU8 while porosity and permeability increase This is expected as MFU1 corresponds to low FZI values small pore throat radius and MFU8 has high FZI values large pore throat radius In general the distribution of PI porosity and permeability for MFU are close to symmetric with little mean versus median differences 5 Geostatistical seismic inversion for metric ﬂow units Table 1 Metric FU MFU cut offs from the FZI S curve 5 1 Stochastic seismic inversion method log FZI values MFU1 MFU2 MFU3 MFU4 MFU5 MFU6 MFU7 MFU8 Geostatistics is a modelling tool that plays an important role in building earth models In geoscience initially developed with the constant grow of the mining industry geostatistical concepts and algorithms have been widely adopted in the oil exploration and production for many purposes Pereira et al 2017 Feng et al 2018 Ferreira and Lupinacci 2018 Kneller et al 2019 Peçanha et al 2019 These techniques are traditionally used to interpolate the target property most commonly facies porosity and permeability below 2 2 2 2 to 0 5 0 5 to 0 2 0 2 to 0 4 0 4 to 0 8 0 8 to 1 9 1 9 to 3 7 Above 3 7 1704

location in the volume the current state of the chain The lateral sampling is consistent with the seismic data grid and the vertical sampling is 1 m II Randomly generate a modiﬁed realization res1 A synthetic seismic synth1 is calculated through convolution between the estimated wavelet and res1 acoustic properties Considering the Bayesian inference scheme compute the likelihood function of res1 given the real seismic data P seis synth1 III Evaluate the prior distribution of the modiﬁed realization P res1 geostats which reﬂects the lateral and vertical continuity computed from the variograms and the value of the property at neighboring cells IV Multiply the prior distribution P res1 geostats with the likelihood function P seis synth1 to compute the posterior probability value given the input information e g statistics well data seismic horizons and stratigraphy This step is the Bayesian inference of the algorithm V Compare the posterior probability value with the current reservoir model res0 If the proposal res1 has a posterior probability value higher than res0 there is P res1 geostats seis P res0 geostats seis then res1 is accepted and the chain moves to a different random location considering res1 as the new current state Otherwise if the value is smaller res1 can be randomically rejected and res0 is the current stat for the next step or accepted as a ratio between P res1 geostats seis and P res0 geostats seis Note that this part is the Metropolis Hastings of the algorithm avoiding the calculation to be stuck in local maxima minima as lower probabilities are sometimes accepted VI The process continues updating for the entire seismic volume until P resn geostats seis is no longer changing Due to the large number of calculations needed to sweep the entire volume the MCMC algorithm only calculate the conditional posterior pdf on a small portion of the volume at a time Combination them all gives the global posterior pdf between well data within a stratigraphic framework The most common method is the sequential gaussian simulation SGS Deutsch and Journel 1992 Since the introduction by Haas and Dubrule 1994 stochastic seismic inversion is an active topic of interest as the technique introduces seismic data as a constraint to generate possible earth models Doyen 2007 However the direct use of seismic as secondary data for reservoir modelling is usually frustrating because of vertical scale differences between seismic usually decametric resolution and well logs centimetric Finding a relationship between for instance seismic amplitude and or impedance volumes and well log porosity is constantly difﬁcult making the incorporation of seismic data directly into the SGS workﬂow a challenge for reservoir characterization Azevedo and Soares 2018 The most documented and used methods for stochastic seismic inversion are SGS Escobar et al 2006 direct sequential simulation DSS Soares 2001 global stochastic inversion GSI Soares et al 2007 and Monte Carlo Markov Chain MCMC Statmod MC Sams et al 2011 Although these methods differ in how to sample a prior posterior pdf they essentially produce multiple realizations of petrophysical properties considering the stratigraphic grid and a given vertical sampling that can be smaller than the available seismic sampling Every iteration produces a geologic model that ﬁts the seismic and well log data i e each realization is plausible samples of the reservoir s posterior distribution and a variance measure of the input parameters considering the seismic data as constrains In this study we perform a Metropolis Hastings MH algorithm within the MCMC method MCMC Statmod MC Sams et al 2011 to simulate the acoustic impedance There are three main steps in the stochastic inversion workﬂow which are detailed further 1 Statistical modelling where are estimated the probability density functions pdfs variograms and trends for each decametric and metric facies 2 Bayesian inference combining the Note that the MCMC algorithm does not change the whole res0 trace considering a single iteration Instead a small portion of the grid is modiﬁed a step at a time until the entire grid is swept All the pdfs are local so they are re calculated every time it moves to another part of the volume For our purpose the stochastic seismic inversion ﬁts very well once we are taking advantage over the seismic constraint in 1705

Velha and Itapema formations show the same behavior These sections are a good example of the advantage of using the seismic constraints over decametric scale and stochastic simulation over metric scale below seismic resolution To illustrate the special distribution PI mean and DFU and MFU mode maps from the Itapema Formation are displayed in Fig 12 Overall prior and posterior pdfs result for PI inversion are consistent within few errors along Barra Velha and Itapema formations except for MFU1 and MFU2 Fig 13 The reason for the discrepancy for these two ﬂow units is the addition of an increasing a prior probability of DFU1 at lower structural regions areas without drilled wells mainly with predominance of mud sediments that corresponds to low PI values Because of those areas this pushes the posterior MFU1 and MFU2 PI values to the left of the plot For the other MFUs metrics such as mean standard deviation P10 and P90 are in match between prior and posterior pdfs The overall prior and posterior proportions of DFU and MFU for both Barra Velha and Itapema formations is presented in Fig 14 MCMC inversion produced occurrence volumes that corroborate the well statistics DFU except for the wells used as blind tests are a perfect match between prior and posterior because they were used as hard constraints at the well location This is not the case for MFU whose small deviations are observed between prior and posterior proportions superimposition between MFU units is larger than the DFU pattern One of the aims is solve this ambiguity through MCMC simulations and several iterations producing a numerous amount of possible MFU occurrence volumes constrained to the seismic data in decametric scale The general behavior observed concentrates more MFU1 in higher PI values and MFU8 in lower PI values like the DFU behavior We chose not to use a constant value for the priori probability in the Bayesian classiﬁcation as the facies are highly heterogenous in carbonate environments Instead we constructed volumes regarding the laterally variable priori probability for each DFU extrapolating through ordinary kriging the facies In the wells considering horizons and framework Since there are no wells drilled in structural lows therefore sampling low energy settings in the study area we applied a multiplier to raise the prior occurrence probabilities of worse permoporous DFU and MFU away from the Mero main structural high This behavior is corroborated by numerous presalt analogs that drilled this speciﬁc setting Lima and De Ros 2019 Neves et al 2019 Gomes et al 2020 For each DFU occurrence there is a prior probability of MFU that corresponds to a mean ratio between its correlated facies obtain from the well data For example if DFU1 occurs in a given location a prior probability for MFU1 is 60 and 40 for MFU2 Fig 10 exempliﬁes how a prior probability varies laterally for DFU4 for exempliﬁcation and a prior probability ratio from MFU1 to MFU8 considering the occurrence of each associated DFU 5 4 Porosity and permeability cosimulation We cosimulated for each PI iteration a numerous quantity of possible f and permeability k volumes given the MFU distributions calculated by the MCMC inversions The procedure for the cosimulation is similarto the workﬂow described in Section 5 1 with the difference that the posterior probability is now coupled with the simulated PI value there is we are sampling for P porosity geostat simPI and P permeability geostat simPI It is important to emphasize that the porosity and permeability cosimulation is restricted with the MFU below the seismic resolution However MFU is directly related to a speciﬁc DFU that is constrained by seismic data So at the end the porosity and permeability are simulated on the metric scale without losing the seismic lateral control Through well data analysis and porosity and permeability volumes obtain from the Bayesian classiﬁcation the vertical and lateral experimental variograms are like those used to the PI MCMC inversion Figs 7 and 8 The porosity and permeability pdfs used for the cosimulation are showed in Fig 15 As previously shown in Table

necessary for the synthetic seismic convolution is the same used for the seismic inversion by Penna et al 2019 Initially all the wells with available well log data were used as hard constrains for the inversion Then we removed three wells to blind tests and performed the inversion The presented results in this publication are blind test versions of the MCMC inversion The mean PI and DFU and MFU most probable occurrence from the 100 iterations and the results of two random iterations are presented in Fig 11 Clearly one notices the relation and distribution of low PI values as DFU3 and DFU4 and MFU5 to MFU8 while high PI values tend to concentrate more DFU1 and DFU2 and consequently MFU1 to MFU4 Also we noted how the occurrence of each MFU is conditioned to the occurrence of its correlated DFU 1712

al 2022 Wright 2022 According to these authors the fascicular shrubs are a product of abiotic calcite precipitation in the relatively higher portions of a wide lacustrine system owing to supersaturation promoted by evaporation and CO2 degassing The intraclastic deposits were generated by reworking of the in situ spherulitic and fascicular deposits by waves and or currents also preferentially in the shallower portions of the lacustrine system Therefore the distribution of the defined BVF seismic facies is consistent with the interpreted genesis of their predominant lithologic types and with the relative depth of the lacustrine system This even considering that the in situ lithologies are not corresponding to purely depositional facies but rather to the combination of depositional con ditions i e the preferential deposition and preservation of magnesian clays matrix in relatively deeper areas with the eodiagenetic to syn genetic precipitation of calcite fascicular shrubs or spherulites Furthermore the genetic processes of the lithologic types predominating in SFB would explain its continuous and high amplitude pattern in the seismic lines as the shrubstones are apparently a product of laterally continuous precipitation of fascicular crusts with coalescing calcite ag gregates and scarce clays features also exhibited by the redeposited intraclastic calcarenites and calcirudites Conversely in the spherul stones of SFA the calcite aggregates are typically less coalesced frequently separated by the Mg clay matrix These observations and interpretations agree with the detailed quantitative petrographic and petrophysical study of the Tupi Field recently published by Carvalho et al 2022 internal unconformities or erosional truncations within the interval 2 The absent or limited syn depositional faulting and the remark able regional continuity of the seismic units indicate a very limited tectonic activity during the deposition of the BVF in the area 3 Based on these conditions the Outer High seems to be already formed before BVF deposition syn rift and or during the for mation of the Pre Alagoas unconformity Although minor uplift or accommodation creation may have occurred during the sag interval there was neither major contemporaneous tectonic ac tivity nor divergent reflection patterns The deposition of the BVF seismic units occurred in a clear onlapping pattern over the Outer High 4 A widespread unconformity marks the top of BVF with several successive erosional truncations This erosion affects mainly the top of SU4 but also SU3 The deposition of the Ariri Formation evaporites started over this unconformity 5 This unconformity may indicate a local uplift close to the Outer High or and a general base level fall preceding the large marine transgression which generated the thick evaporitic deposits 6 The lithological composition of the BVF is essentially constituted by magnesian clays calcite spherulites and fascicular shrubs but presents very complex facies variations resulting in patterns in undistinguishable conventional logs 7 However a clear differentiation can be made based on seismic texture analysis and seismic attributes defining two seismic facies SFA and SFB with distinctive recognition parameters and very complex geometry 8 In general SFB occurs as isolated sheet like zones within SFA preferentially along the relative highs and in SU4 9 Lithologic types recognized in five wells along the Tupi Field indicate that the defined seismic facies correspond to patterns of combination and distribution of dominant rock types 10 Seismic facies A corresponds mostly to calcite spherulites and Mgclays mud deposits which constitute the background of lacus trine sedimentation predominant and preferentially preserved in relatively lower areas of the system 11 Seismic facies B corresponds mostly to crusts of calcite fascicular shrubs formed as syngenetic to eodiagenetic precipitates and to resedimented deposits made of spherulitic and fascicular intraclasts 12 The complex distribution both laterally and temporally between the seismic facies suggests a complex origin related to the com bination of depositional and diagenetic processes essentially as a product of chemical abiotic generation in an alkaline lacustrine environment and to sublacustrine reworking 13 The mainly post depositional configuration of the Tupi Field area along with the continuity and onlap patterns of seismic units onto a high remaining of post rift erosion support a shallow evaporitic lake model rather than a deep lake with microbial platforms 5 2 Depositional model for the Barra Velha Formation in the Tupi Field Various authors suggested different models for the deposition of the BVF during the Aptian sag phase While some interpreted that the BVF was deposited in a large shallow evaporitic lake environment Pietzsch et al 2018 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Wright 2022 others defend a deep lacustrine system with microbial platforms Buckley et al 2015 Faria et al 2017 Minzoni et al 2020 The shallow evaporitic lake model explains most Pre Salt major structures as product of mainly post depositional faulting including local inversion erosion and rota tion of onlap terminations The deep lake model mainly considers the relief at the base of the salt and some clinoforms as prograding structures associated with carbonate platforms and buildups The mainly post depositional configuration of the Tupi Field area along with the continuity and onlap patterns of seismic units onto a high remaining of post rift erosion support a shallow evaporitic lake model rather than a deep lake with microbial platforms This interpretation is also supported by the detailed petrographic and faciologic study recently published by Carvalho et al 2022 In addition to that there is no evidence or even stratigraphic potential for the BVF carbonate system to develop such buildup structures in the study area Barnett et al 2018 proposed a model of subaerial erosion and alluvial gravitational redeposition for the intraclastic BVF deposits However the configura tion of BVF seismic facies SFA and SFB with a large distribution of resedimented rocks and lack of subaerial features does not support this model neither for the Tupi Field nor for the Búzios Field Ferreira et al 2021 where are the best pre salt reservoirs CRediT authorship contribution statement 6 Conclusions Vitor P Sommer Writing original draft Visualization Investi gation Data curation Conceptualization Juliano Kuchle

Palaeogeography Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology 507 2018 60 80 R Pietzsch et al long standing debate on the occurrence of the ﬁrst marine incursions during the opening of the South Atlantic has also involved these deposits Silva Telles et al 1994 have attributed marine incursions into Campos Basin already during Jiquiá times which corresponds to the deposition of the coquinas from the Lagoa Feia Group the counterpart of Itapema Fm in the Santos Basin but this has been contested by Thompson et al 2015 Dias 2005 attributed a marine deposition to the carbonates of the Macabú Formation Lagoa Feia Group Winter et al 2007 Campos Basin which is adjacent to Santos Basin possess the same facies association and is considered to be time equivalent to the Barra Velha Formation Moreira et al 2007 and Gomes et al 2009 suggested that the latter formation was deposited in a transitional environment under marine inﬂuence In turn Wright and Barnett 2015 also added to the controversy regarding the depositional history of these carbonates discarding the hypothesis of marine origin and favouring the deposition of the Barra Velha carbonates in an alkaline lacustrine environment based on sedimentological and mineralogical descriptions Recently Tedeschi 2017 has provided strong evidence in support of this latter view based on 87Sr 86Sr data from carbonates of the Campos and Santos basins Finally Souza et al 2018 have presented a new petrologic study in which the authors interpret many of the Barra Velha carbonate rocks as travertine related deposits derived from a signiﬁcant contemporaneous hydrothermal component of this system Our study is focused on the Itapema and Barra Velha Formations correlated to the Jiquiá and Alagoas local stages based on ostracods respectively covering the syn rift to post rift sag sequences These in turn have been traditionally considered to range approximately from late Barremian to late Aptian Moreira et al 2007 Poropat and Colin 2012a Buckley et al 2015 Thompson et al 2015 but see also Tedeschi et al 2017 The studied rocks are predominantly composed of carbonates with variable proportion of silicate minerals Formation which is generally composed of interbedded bivalve rudstones and grainstones and black shales The upper unit is known as the Barra Velha Formation and has recently been described in greater detail by Arienti et al 2018 and Souza et al 2018 This unit is predominantly constituted by shrubby limestones laminated limestones and dolostones intraclastic grainstones and hybrid conglomerates and arenites as well as spherulitic and dolomitic Mg rich silicate claystones Above the Barra Velha Fm lies the evaporitic sequence constituted by nearly 2 km of salt deposits in some parts of the basin and corresponding to the Ariri Formation Moreira et al 2007 Still above them lies a sequence of marine platform carbonates overlain by thick deposits of coastal shelf slope and pelagic sediments ranging in age from Albian to the Holocene The evolution of the Santos Basin occurred in such a way that it favoured a progressive burial of the pre salt rocks and for this reason they do not crop out in any portion of the basin Fig 2 presents the stratigraphic chart of Santos Basin along with biostratigraphic zones with focus on the speciﬁc interval corresponding to the Early Cretaceous The Barra Velha Formation lays unconformably over the Itapema Fm This limit is usually easily mapped in seismic sections having a regional expression and is known in both Campos and Santos basins as the pre Alagoas unconformity Winter et al 2007 Moreira et al 2007 The age corresponding to the top of Itapema Fm is not well constrained but is estimated to be around 120 and 123 1 Ma according to deﬁnitions for the timing of the pre Alagoas unconformity presented by the latter authors The Barra Velha Fm is further subdivided in two stratigraphic sequences the unconformity bounded lower and upper Barra Velha Formation The intra Alagoas unconformity not always traceable represents the boundary between these two The upper Barra Velha Fm is further limited by the Ariri Fm deposits above it Moreira et al 2007 The lower and upper Barra Velha Fm correspond to the upper synrift and to the sag phases respectively Moreira et al 2007 Buckley et al 2015 The facies corresponding to these two sequences have been interpreted in the past as being deposited in a transitional environment from continental to shallow marine setting Moreira et al 2007 In the majority of the South Atlantic oﬀshore basins the biostratigraphic charts with respect to the Lower Cretaceous interval are based on non marine ostracods and or palynomorphs Schaller 1969 Viana et al 1971 Moura 1988 Silva Telles 1992 Poropat and Colin 2012a 2012b Grosdidier et al 1996 Classically the biostratigraphic zonation based on non marine ostracods led to the establishment of six local stages spanning from the Tithonian to the lower Albian Moura 1988 two of which are important to the present study the Jiquiá and the Alagoas local stages which span from the Barremian to the lower Albian Fig 2 In a broader sense all of the aforementioned studies converge to the same results with a few discrepancies appearing only in the detailed approach Absolute age determinations for this non marine sequence have been a long standing problem diﬃcult to tackle Estimations of the duration of the Jiquiá local Stage which encompasses the whole of the Itapema Fm have varied from 2 to 5 Myr Silva Telles 1996 Estimations for the Alagoas local Stage comprising the entirety of the Barra Velha and Ariri Formations have been an even worse problem because of inconsistencies with respect to the upper limit of its type section its lower faunistic diversity of ostracods and scarcity of any other fossil group useful for the purposes of relative dating In a recent contribution though Tedeschi et al 2017 presented new evidence in which the evaporites above this entire sequence may be correlated to the early Aptian Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a OAE 1a around 120 or 125 Ma according to Malinverno et al 2010 and Ogg et al 2012 respectively Thus previous estimates of ages for the sequences below the evaporites are unquestionably pending thorough revision as well In addition to the depositional history of the pre salt succession a 3 Methods 3 1 Sampling and material The data used in this study were all acquired from well S10 Fig 1 The studied interval encompasses 800 m of rock record whose present day depth is nearly 5000 m below sea level The samples for the geochemical study comprise recovered sidewall cores roughly 3 cm in length per two and a half centimetres in diameter in average Usually only a small fraction of a few grams is harnessed for chemical studies and biostratigraphic analyses and thus allowed to be completely consumed 3 2 Cleaning protocol for geochemical analyses Prior to the geochemical analyses all samples were submitted to oil and salt extraction This was conducted in two steps using Soxhlet apparatuses 1 using an azeotrope mixture consisting of methanol and chloroform 30 70 v v until no ﬂuorescence under 365 nm wavelength UV light was observed which was followed by 2 extraction with methanol and using 10 AgNO3 for checking salt removal The absence of AgCl precipitates indicated complete removal of the latter After drying all available samples were crushed and ground to a size below 80 mesh powder using agate pestle and mortar and were homogenised Aliquots were then taken for the geochemical analyses 3 3 Biostratigraphy The non marine ostracod analyses were carried out on 123 composite cuttings each individual sample comprising material collected within every 6 m and on 60 additional cuttings collected in three metre intervals along the intermediate portion of the well Additionally 36 sidewall core samples unevenly distributed along the well were also 63

sediments in the case of cuttings in a 30 hydrogen peroxide solution until the complete oxidation of organic matter Next steps included sample washing on a 0 125 mm sieve and handpicking of total specimens The identiﬁcation of the picked specimens was done using a stereomicroscope with reﬂected light ﬁlled with SrSpec 100 150 μm resin after the ﬁrst leaching 87Sr 86Sr ratios were determined using a Triton Plus thermal ionization mass spectrometer in static multicollector mode at the Geochronology Laboratory of the University of Brasília Analyses were calibrated with measurements of the NBS 987 standard SrCO3 yielding an average value of 0 710280 0 000010 2SD All 87Sr 86Sr data were corrected for fractionation assuming a 88Sr 86Sr ratio 0 1194 3 4 Petrography 3 7 Statistical analysis Altogether 151 sidewall core samples were analysed described and classiﬁed under a transmitted polarised light optical microscope considering texture fabric and compositional aspects Hence modal compositions of primary and diagenetic minerals and paragenetic interpretations were obtained through systematic qualitative petrography in each thin section prepared from samples impregnated with blue epoxy resin Staining with hydrochloric solution of alizarin Red S and potassium ferrocyanide was performed in order to diﬀerentiate the carbonate mineral phases cf Friedman 1959 Scanning electron microscopy analyses were carried out on carbon coated selected thin sections in a JEOL JSM 6690LV microscope with support from an Oxford Inca energy dispersive spectrometer EDS for a ﬁner characterisation of the elemental composition of some constituents For statistical treatment all elements were converted to the same unit ppm Those originally reported as oxides were also converted to element concentration A composite table was built to include the additional set of samples that had results originated only from XRF analysis and to report all data together for the following steps necessary to statistical assessment see Supplementary material Supplementary material is available upon request Prior to statistical analysis elements were evaluated to account for the number of undetected values The composite data of potassium ICP OES handheld XRF data represented the largest set of samples with lower than limit of detection results amounting 16 8 samples below LOD for both ICP OES and XRF where K2O 0 01 and 0 02 respectively These zero results were replaced by a random value between zero and the respective limit of detection and the same followed for the other elements that were in similar situation Once the data were properly organised they were ready for statistical analysis In order to better assess the elemental data in addition to the traditional evaluation of bivariate plots between isotope and element ratios as in some cases used further below Principal Component Analysis PCA was employed to evaluate the relationship among all the elements The need for caution when drawing inferences from simple correlations between single elements or their ratios to some common denominator is a subject already well documented in geochemistry and chemometrics more generally e g Aitchison 1986 Rock 1988 Rollinson 1993 Varmuza and Filzmoser 2009 Filzmoser et al 2009 Compositional data carry the intrinsic characteristic that no individual component can be interpreted isolated from each other derived from the fact that 3 5 Elemental composition A total of 194 sidewall core samples were analysed for determination of nine selected elements Sr Ca Mg Mn Fe K Rb Al and Si From that total 192 intact sidewall core samples were analysed on their ﬂat surfaces using an Olympus Delta Premium 6000 handheld emission dispersive X ray ﬂuorescence device XRF after the cleaning protocol This instrument is equipped with a Rh anode working at 4 W as an excitation source and a 40 kV tube Samples were analysed in a workstation for operator protection under atmospheric environment in both Soil and Mining Plus modes In addition 151 sidewall core samples had enough material to follow grinding and powdering after which they were analysed by ICPMS and ICP OES Determination of major elements Ca Si Al K and Rb was carried out on powdered samples fused in lithium metaborate and analysed after digestion in HCl for determination of whole rock composition The ﬁrst four elements were analysed in an Optima 7300 DV Perkin Elmer inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer ICP OES whereas Rb was determined in an Elan DRC II Perkin Elmer ICP MS The elements Mg Fe Mn and Sr were also determined in the ICP MS after digestion of the powders in aqua regia solution 3 1 HCl HNO3 v v for extraction of elements bound essentially to the carbonate phase Reproducibility and precision of the methods were based on the analysis of Certiﬁed Reference Materials and laboratory duplicate samples Reference materials IPT 122 dolomitic limestone IPT 44 limestone NIST 1d argillaceous limestone NIST 88b dolomitic limestone and BRP 1 basalt were used to calibrate XRF analyses and verify both reproducibility and precision of the methods above A total of 149 samples overlap between XRF and ICP methods so that quality control could be performed in order to verify discrepancies that could arise from the use of results derived from diﬀerent methods The analytical data can be consulted in the Supplementary material which is available upon request x1 x2 xD 1 1 where the terms in Eq 1 correspond to individual element concentrations The set of compositional data as a whole comprises a vector or a matrix that is subjected to the eﬀects of unit sum constraint or closure where one single sample is represented in the following way Aitchison 1986 x D x1 x2 xD 2 This constraint can eventually lead to forced correlations between variables In order to avoid this problem before multivariate statistical analysis the compositional data were ﬁrst treated following the mathematical procedure of centered log ratio transformation Aitchison 1986 Filzmoser et al 2009 Montero Serrano et al 2010 which is deﬁned as x1 xD clr x y1 yD ln ln D D D x i D x i 1 i 1 i 3 6 Strontium isotope analyses 3 As will be seen later this transformation allows good evaluation of the results of Principal Component Analysis at the level of exploratory data analysis signiﬁcantly reducing bias that might otherwise occur These results allow to address important aspects with respect to the behaviour of the elements and to support additional inferences concerning palaeoenvironmental or diagenetic conditions associated with the samples 194 rock samples were analysed for 87Sr 86Sr ratio For this purpose 1 mg of carbonate powder was digested in weak

2018 with the predominance of the former There are also occurrences of spherulitic and fascicular optic calcite aggregates partially replacing and displacing Mg silicate laminations and particles suggesting an eogenetic origin of these components Mg silicate constituents are commonly dissolved siliciﬁed or dolomitized Intraclastic grainstones are recurrent and mainly composed of fragments of either fascicular or spherulitic aggregates recording successive events of hydrodynamic reworking inside the lake not shown The upper portion is largely devoid of signiﬁcant detrital material with subordinated presence of silt sized quartz feldspar and mica grains and detrital clay Bioclastic material is scarce and represented by rare ostracod shells These sedimentological evidences suggest that ﬂuvial input was likely greater or more signiﬁcant during the time of deposition of the Itapema Formation in the Jiquiá Fig 4 illustrates some of the most common primary and diagenetic constituents found in the studied well Mg silicate constituents e g kerolite and stevensite are labile and more susceptible to be either dissolved or replaced by calcite silica and dolomite being frequently underestimated in the past Just recently few authors highlighted such features both in rift and sag intervals of the Campos and Santos basins Goldberg et al 2014 Armelenti et al 2016 Tosca and Wright 2015 Souza et al 2018 Recently Alvarenga et al 2016 documented for the ﬁrst time occurrences of hydrothermal vents associated to the rift phase Lagoa Feia Group of Campos Basin Winter et al 2007 had previously interpreted that this group contains mineralogical associations such as talc and stevensite that the authors interpreted as products of hydrothermal activity within alkaline volcanic lake s in Campos Basin Hence hydrothermal activity was likely also common in Santos Basin as also suggested by Souza et al 2018 In spite of that seepage unrelated to hydrothermalism could also have been another source of ions to the lake Discharge of groundwater as cold seeps or springs can be a signiﬁcant component of recharge in many lakes as documented for instance in the Ethiopian plateau and in the Great Salt Lake Kebede et al 2008 Hart et al 2004 the biozone calibration attempt made by Poropat and Colin 2012a as previously shown Moreover as introduced above the age of the bottom of the evaporites has been generally accepted to be around 112 or 113 Ma until very recently cf Dias et al 1994 Dias 1998 Dias 2005 Davison 2007 Karner and Gambôa 2007 The latter age has been taken further to constrain the top of the Barra Velha Formation according to Moreira et al 2007 Nonetheless Tedeschi et al 2017 suggest that these assumptions are probably wrong and that the timing of the deposition of the evaporites very likely occurred during OAE 1a This would place the top of the Barra Velha Formation at 120 or 125 Ma Consequently we considered the two diﬀerent age scenarios in our models with reference to time below The ﬁrst one scenario 1 assumes the former age estimate and hence a considerably stretched interval of time for the deposition of the Barra Velha carbonates and the other scenario 2 assumes the bottom of the evaporite sequence to be 120 Ma old which results in a comparatively more compressed time period for the deposition of the Barra Velha Formation To avoid inconsistencies we assume the age of 123 Ma to limit the top of the Itapema Fm for both scenarios above The age of the bottom of the entire sequence is constrained by the correlation of the Camboriú basalts with the Cabiúnas basalts of Campos Basin whose age range between 134 and 122 Ma Mizusaki et al 1992 Winter et al 2007 Moreira et al 2007 We ﬁx the bottom of the Itapema Fm at 126 Ma in the two scenarios for the purposes of modelling Thus any changes that could be imparted to our calculations would be exclusively related to the extent of time of the deposition of the Barra Velha carbonates Scenario 1 results in a minimum sedimentation rate of approximately 131 m Myr and 54 m Myr for the Jiquiá and the Alagoas respectively Both are close to present day sedimentation rates found in lakes belonging to rift settings such as the Baikal and the Tanganyika Casanova 1994 Talbot and Allen 1996 These sedimentation rates for carbonates are possibly somewhat underestimated because they do not take into account the eﬀect of compaction Nevertheless in a recent forward modelling study Faria et al 2017 estimated a depositional rate of 80 m Myr for the Barra Velha carbonates which although higher than the value used here lies in close range with it Scenario 2 on the other hand results in a sedimentation rate of 131 m Myr and 210 m Myr for the Jiquiá and the Alagoas respectively Although the sedimentation rate of the Barra Velha carbonates is nearly four fold greater in this scenario this rate of deposition is actually within the lower range of deposition of some modern lacustrine carbonates and travertines for instance e g Lamb et al 2007 Pentecost 2005 Fouke 2011 4 3 Geochemical data The handheld XRF has its limitations and the analysis of unprepared raw samples increases the chances of occurrence of greater dispersity of X ray energy In addition the nature of the heterogeneous rock sample itself prevents optimised analytical performance Although not ideal these were practical limitations that had to be overcome in order to provide additional insight into our conceptual model and test it more critically and quantitatively Overall the analytical results are fairly good as shown in Fig 5 Naturally the correlations between ICPOES and handheld XRF data and ICP MS and handheld XRF data in these cases are not exactly perfect but the results show statistically signiﬁcant levels of agreement p 01 df 147 and p 01 df 146 respectively This supports the use of XRF data as complementary to the whole set of analysed samples once it is done with caution and parsimony In terms of geochemical composition the graphics in Fig 6 also distinguish clearly the two main intervals Jiquia and Alagoas The ﬁgure compiles scatterplot data of 87Sr 86Sr ratio vs 1 Sr Rb Sr Sr Ca Mn Sr and Mg Ca providing another indication that diﬀerent sources contributed in variable proportions with time to the overall isotopic composition and Sr concentration of lake waters One mixing line is suggested from Fig 6A and B the 87Sr 86Sr vs 1 Sr and 87 Sr 86Sr vs Rb Sr respectively although it cannot be discarded that this eﬀect is produced as a result of greater siliciclastic proportion at the base and its subsequent decrease upwards in the sequence However Sr concentrations in most samples were determined after selective digestion and not from bulk rock analysis as explained above derived 4 2 Petrography The lower part of the studied section the Itapema Formation contains bivalve rudstones and grainstones coquinas arenites composed of Mg silicate ooids peloids and intraclasts and bioclasts as well as subordinated ﬁne grained laminated mudrocks and marls with variable organic matter content Fig 4E H In some samples authigenic quartz occurs either cementing or replacing both primary and other diagenetic constituents mainly Mg silicates Dolomite also occur either as cement or as replacement in some samples Ostracods are common amidst these rocks In some samples phosphate bioclasts of up to a few millimetres interpreted as being the remnants of vertebrate organisms are also found From the palaeontological point of view the fossil record observed throughout the whole interval indicates that signiﬁcantly arid conditions predate the Alagoas time since no evidence of vegetation of any kind is found Nevertheless the Jiquiá was probably relatively more humid than the Alagoas as indicated by the ostracod fauna discussed above and by further geochemical data The upper interval represented by the Barra Velha Formation Fig 4A D belongs to the Alagoas local stage and is predominantly composed of syngenetic fascicular optic calcite aggregates with 66

For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article bottom of the well as indicated by the Al and Si proﬁles where they show the same trends and correlate whereas the carbonates prevail along most of the studied interval It is also possible to see that these carbonates have a signiﬁcantly high content of Sr and that there is indeed a diﬀerence in Sr concentration between the Jiquiá and the Alagoas local stages in which the latter becomes more enriched in this element Authigenic Mg silicates and silica eventually are another relatively important secondary component of the system indicated by the Si proﬁle uncorrelated with Al and the Mg proﬁle often occurring together with the carbonates in the Barra Velha and Itapema Fm as described above Moreover dolomite also accounts for a signiﬁcant portion of Mg present in the samples throughout the well These ﬁgures suggest that the Alagoas derives its relatively higher strontium concentration from evaporation and concentration of lake waters as no other mixing line seems evident The heavier 87Sr 86Sr end member probably reﬂects a contribution of initially less Sr enriched but highly evaporated waters as we will discuss further below Fig 6D It could also be argued on the other hand that simply a diﬀerent Sr Ca partition between solid and ﬂuid could be the reason for such distinction But other aspects related to the chemical composition of the carbonate samples and their mineralogy do not seem to favour this hypothesis These are discussed in more detail below with particular emphasis on the Mg Ca ratio Also the Sr Ca partition coeﬃcient Kd may vary as a function of the Sr Ca ratio in the liquid temperature did not have their isotopic composition signiﬁcantly aﬀected From both Figs 6 and 7 below it can be observed that the carbonates from the studied sequence as a whole have characteristically radiogenic signals which are signiﬁcantly higher than Aptian marine values these in turn being lower than 0 7075 e g Bralower et al 1997 Bodin et al 2015 Such high values indicate a signiﬁcant continental inﬂuence strongly supporting the deposition of the carbonates in a lacustrine environment Moreover a few additional distinctions can be made Samples from Jiquiá are predominantly limited to a range of lower 87Sr 86Sr values below 0 7115 in general whereas the opposite occur for samples from the Alagoas which are roughly between 0 714 and 0 712 It is observed that the 87Sr 86Sr ratio generally increases with increasing carbonate content towards the top of the analysed section The Rb Sr ratio as measured in the samples is usually well below 0 001 in roughly 60 of the cases 114 samples becoming consistently lower upwards Fig 6B These observations also strongly indicate that contamination due to leachate contaminants in our samples should not be considered as a reason for the high 87Sr 86Sr ratio observed in the upper part of the section since they become more radiogenic upwards with increasing carbonate prevalence and therefore provide a good indication of actual lake water evolution Fig 7 also shows the concentration proﬁles of Ca Sr Al Si and Mg along with that of 87Sr 86Sr From these proﬁles one can see that the contribution from detrital material is relatively low but was somewhat higher at

clearly Ellipses indicate samples that were likely more signiﬁcantly modiﬁed after burial although their Sr isotopic ratio apparently was not greatly altered For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article dehydrate as required for ﬁxation on mineral surfaces Reeder 1983 Deocampo 2010 As a result dolomite may have formed in very early diagenetic stage in periods of desiccation or ﬂuid expulsion amidst the sediment due to compaction and or crystal growth of later phases Nonetheless in terms of its Sr isotopic composition it should be reasonable to expect that later phases such as dolomites would not diﬀer signiﬁcantly from primary carbonate phases because they would derive from the same but more concentrated ﬂuid Notwithstanding apart from the bivalves whose shell composition vary and can be composed solely of aragonite Scholle and UlmerScholle 2003 the original constitution of the main carbonate content now comprised by calcite minerals is mostly speculative Although the chemical analyses reveal Sr concentrations in the pre salt carbonate samples compatible with those in modern calcite rather than aragonite minerals precipitated from the same waters e g Gasse and Fontes 1989 Sunagawa et al 2007 the possibility of loss of Sr due to inversion of aragonite to a stable phase could not be entirely excluded However facies constituted by calcite shrubs Fig 3 do not show evidence of previous microstructures and crystal dissolution and substitution which would be required for replacement of aragonite by calcite Morse and Mackenzie 1990 In addition the signiﬁcant amount of bulk rock data and its consistency throughout the geological sequence allow us to have conﬁdence with respect to its signiﬁcance as a reliable proxy for general lake water chemistry and hydrology Apparently roughly 10 samples are suspected to have been subjected to more signiﬁcant alteration according to the data displayed in Fig 6 and these are also highlighted in the supplementary material table available upon request Despite this they have not been excluded from the whole set of data for modelling purposes In general along with petrographic observations which allow distinguishing the presence of calcite from dolomite it seems that the possibility of pervasive recrystallization signiﬁcantly modifying the original rock isotopic composition can be disregarded Hence the 87Sr 86Sr ratio can be used as a proxy for palaeohydrologic reconstruction of the lake through time and kinetics of precipitation although it does not seem to vary appreciably in higher temperature ranges of deep diagenesis Jacobson and Usdowski 1976 Gabitov and Watson 2006 Environmental temperature change is not expected to have been signiﬁcant for at that time span the lake system was already within the tropical range and topography was not very high Karner and Gambôa 2007 Precipitation rates may indeed have varied with time of deposition Fast rates are associated to higher Kd and depending on the age model we use the Alagoas carbonates had either lower or greater rates of deposition than those from the Jiquiá as discussed above Thus it is not straightforward to assess the role of the rates of precipitation as a relevant controlling factor On the other hand when the Sr Ca ratio increases in the liquid phase Sr concentration tends to increase proportionally in the solid Jacobson and Usdowski 1976 This supposition seems more likely in the geological context that is being considered and apparently agrees with observations Additionally the 87Sr 86Sr vs Mn Sr data in Fig 6C suggests two trends one in the lower part of the diagram which may represent the depositional history in agreement with the Rb Sr and 1 Sr data and another in the upper part that seems to be indicative of the interaction with post depositional ﬂuids modifying the primary carbonates The latter trend suggests that the system may have become open and prone to dissolution and recrystallization of primary carbonate minerals incorporating Mn ions likely in reducing conditions where the smaller ionic radius of Mn2 would not make it unfavourable to assimilation into the carbonate lattice It is also seen from 87Sr 86Sr vs Mg Ca in Fig 6E that Mg Ca ratio is usually rather low for the majority of samples seemingly representing a low background value of 1 This allows discriminating a set of a few samples that were likely subjected to pervasive recrystallization within the ellipse area without apparently at least signiﬁcantly being able to alter the original 87Sr 86Sr isotopic composition Alternatively dolomite could have formed very early at later stages during the deposition or during early diagenesis Either way such a few samples presenting signs of alteration and the consistency of the 87Sr 86Sr values suggest that post depositional ﬂuids could not signiﬁcantly overprint the primary isotopic signals and that the system was likely rock buﬀered with respect to any later ﬂuids Although the Mg Ca ratio represents bulk rock analysis what is clear from the background values is that most of the carbonate phase present in the samples is consisted of calcite and dolomite constitutes the subordinate carbonate mineral phase as also observed from petrography From Fig 6F it is observed that dolomite samples do not contain expressive concentrations of Mn and the opposite seems true for some of the samples composed by calcite With respect to the three samples with signiﬁcantly high Mg Ca ratio another possibility is that they may constitute a mixture of carbonate and somewhat labile Mgclay minerals because the latter may have been prone to dissolution by the digestion method that was used i e aqua regia dissolution This may be clariﬁed in future X ray diﬀraction studies It is not possible to securely infer based on bulk chemistry alone if the primary precursor carbonate phases were aragonite or calcite or stable calcite or Mg calcite The considerable proportion of dolomite observed in some samples and the occurrence of Mg silicates as illustrated in thin sections shown in Fig 3 apparently suggest that the original ﬂuid Mg Ca ratio was likely relatively high In such circumstances the precipitation of more pure Ca carbonate in the form of aragonite is favoured leading to even higher ﬂuid Mg Ca ratios Deocampo 2010 In this case dolomite would not represent a primary constituent in part because of the larger hydration sphere of Mg compared to Ca resulting in kinetically unfavourable conditions to 4 4 Strontium isotope data To account for radiogenic contribution derived from detrital components we corrected our measured 87Sr 86Sr Rmeas to the initial 87 Sr 86Sr Rinitial using calculated 87Rb 86Sr values based on the ratio 86 Sr 88Sr 0 1194 and the abundances of the other naturally occurring Sr isotopes in our samples Faure and Mensing 2005 The Rb Sr results provided by the chemical analyses discussed above also necessarily had to be accounted for in this correction The correction took into account the 87Rb decay constant of 1 42 10 11 y 1 and a perhaps overestimated age of 130 Ma We chose to consider this age due to uncertainty regarding the absence of suﬃcient precise age constraints with respect to the pre salt deposits and to deliberately extrapolate the maximum age of our section to an older limit If no signiﬁcant change results from this extrapolation then it means modiﬁcation of the original lake water 87Sr 86Sr and thus of the carbonates due to detrital contribution is of little concern and can be disregarded The curve based on the corrected values is also shown in Fig 7 It can be seen that the correction does not result in signiﬁcant change for most of the proﬁle except for the bottom interval where some of the corrected data become considerably less radiogenic Although Richter and DePaolo 1988 and Richter and Liang 1993 have comprehensively addressed the problem of diagenesis aﬀecting the original 87Sr 86Sr composition of marine carbonates they concluded that this eﬀect is small for conditions where high precision 70

comprising samples more inﬂuenced by terrigenous siliciclastic contribution to the left and another with samples more strictly related to chemical deposition to the right With respect to the Jiquiá interval it can be observed that its samples present greater silicate content likely associated with constituents of detrital nature also shown by the chemical analysis and the PCA results As shown above the environment in general seems to have been relatively milder from the point of view of micropalaeontology which reveals a greater abundance of non marine ostracods in the lower part of the studied section followed by a steady trend of decreasing occurrences and forms upwards Together these data support the assumption that ﬂuvial input should have been more signiﬁcant during that time Regarding the upper interval pertaining to the Alagoas local Stage the carbonates correspond essentially to authigenic precipitates seldom containing mud sized detrital siliciclastic material and rare bioclasts represented by ostracod shells This can be deduced also from the geochemical standpoint as expressed in the PCA results Whereas the general distribution of elements in both graphics A and B from Fig 9 shows a similar pattern there are subtle diﬀerences between them Rubidium aluminium iron and potassium are in both cases related to the ﬁeld that corresponds to stronger detrital contribution on the left corner of the graphics Silicon on the other hand is closely associated to those four elements in samples belonging to the Jiquiá whereas it shows an adverse behaviour when we consider the samples that belong to the Alagoas Such a diﬀerence can be attributed to the greater occurrence of chert beds in the Alagoas Fig 9A with silica cementing pores or replacing previous mineral phases Some minor terrigenous constituents are also present in the samples from this interval This could be the reason why silicon did not correlate with principal component 1 PC1 to great extent because it is not predominantly linked to detrital constituents In addition its soluble forms require distinct physical chemical conditions from those of carbonates to precipitate Probably for a similar reason manganese do not correlate with any other element in the Alagoas because it might be predominantly associated to phases other than carbonates such as oxides In the Jiquiá Fig 9B Mn shows greater correlation with Ca and Sr suggesting that these carbonates might have formed incorporating some of this element in their structure a feature that could be further investigated using high resolution chemical analyses associated to cathodoluminescence in petrographic thin sections A similar pattern was already indicated in Fig 6 which highlighted 87Sr 86Sr vs Mn Sr ratio and showed signs of two distinct Mn contributions The PCA results clearly show that this methodology can be applied preliminarily as a means of exploratory data assessment and to indicate ways to conduct further speciﬁc analysis in a given study Accordingly the geochemical data and the PCA results corroborate petrographic observations and the expected general behaviour of the elements We can expect additionally carbonate samples from Jiquiá to be relatively more calcitic due to greater correlation of Ca and Sr alone with PC1 and carbonates from the Alagoas to contain a greater proportion of dolomite as shown by the association among Ca Sr and Mg in Fig 9A This ﬁnal observation is also supported by the examination of thinsections 1 Stronger detrital contribution 2 Stronger chemical

part of the studied interval presented greater faunal abundance and diversity with characteristics of species living in a more suitable less stressing environment which suggests a more humid climate

Palaeogeography Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology 507 2018 60 80 R Pietzsch et al sourced by volcanic terranes But as we see from the above 87Sr 86Sr data determined in our carbonate samples volcanic sources probably were not the only source to the lake Felsic rocks from the basement and or alluvial material derived from it were likely also contributing as sources of ions to the composition of subsurface waters as suggested by Tedeschi 2017 or perhaps as another catchment area draining to the lake However concerning this latter argument the lack of detrital components in expressive amounts in the corresponding sequence does not support the hypothesis of direct input resulting from erosion and surface transport via catchments and rivers On the other hand the relative contribution made from waters draining or seeping through felsic rocks is speculative and can only be inferred We do not know the exact conﬁguration of the palaeodrainage basin or of the groundwater system However we can assume some reasonable premises For instance Reston 2010 argues that the upper surface of a lake in a rift setting would initially be maintained above sea level as a result of initial thermal uplift and high volume of sediment inﬂux Consequently excess water would drain from the rift valley edges towards the open ocean With further regional subsidence the basin would become internally draining and the lake surface would stand below sea level Following this the lake water would become more brackish and evaporation would become the only way to remove water from the basin The thought is reasonable and is upon this scenario that we build our model Geophysical investigation based on gravimetric magnetic and seismic data supports the postulate that diﬀerentiated mantle derived magma underplating added material to the highly stretched continental crust on the Brazilian southeastern margin below the structural high named the Outer High Carminatti et al 2008 Gomes et al 2009 Scotchman et al 2010 Buckley et al 2015 Accordingly this resulted in long lasting positive structures on which it is assumed that the deposition of shallow water lacustrine carbonates was favoured recording an almost continuous deposition from Barremian to the Aptian such as the Tupi and Sugar Loaf highs Mohriak et al 2012 Buckley et al 2015 Additionally lakes in active rift settings are occasionally fed by subsurface waters of both hydrothermal origin or associated with groundwater seepages Hydrothermal systems are known to occur in modern day lakes in rift settings Tiercelin et al 1989 Barrat et al 2000 Dekov et al 2014 and there is compelling evidence in Campos Basin suggesting that the same might have occurred in Santos Basin Alvarenga et al 2016 Souza et al 2018 have also given support for the hydrothermal origin of the Barra Velha carbonates in the Santos Basin Besides this the supply of subsurface waters whether hydrothermal in origin or not can be signiﬁcant as the existence of several lakes in arid zones is a testimony Hillaire Marcel and Casanova 1987 Gasse and Fontes 1989 Casanova and Hillaire Marcel 1992a 1992b Kebede et al 2005 Kebede et al 2008 Moreover Tedeschi 2017 has shown more direct evidence of signiﬁcantly radiogenic groundwaters extensively inﬂuencing the isotope values of the lake derived carbonates spanning deposits from the basins of Campos to Santos According to the evidence provided by his study and to additional observations direct surface seawater incursion into the pre salt lake can be discarded at least signiﬁcantly because 1 strontium isotopes indicate the opposite trend than that one would expect for an opening seaway 2 in the studied well there are no occurrences of sulphate or chloride deposits interbedded with the carbonates along this interval both as primary or diagenetic precipitates not even as pseudomorphs or as engulfed remnants after complete or partial replacement by other diagenetic phases or moldic porosity after complete dissolution of salt crystals 3 the absence of unequivocal marine fossils and 4 according to published data during most of this time the Florianópolis and Rio Grande Highs to the south of the basin appear to have prevented the access of marine waters which ﬁnally seems to have occurred from the north during the late Aptian Arai 2009 Scotchman et al 2010 Thompson et al 2015 Buckley et al 2015 The synthesis of the Along with the characteristic facies variation upwards and the geochemical data discussed previously it can be deduced that whatever the reason for the signiﬁcant change observed in the biostratigraphic record and in sedimentation pattern was these changes reﬂect an alteration in the hydrology of the lake These observations indicate that the lake system was likely fed by a river or drainage system which contributed relatively more diluted waters to the lake and allowed a more diverse ostracod fauna to thrive Its relative inﬂuence possibly became progressively less eﬀective during the evolution to the sag phase as a resulting lower relief would aﬀect negatively the ﬂow rate of surface waters and the source catchment area probably became further far away This interpretation is compatible with the evolution of the tectonic environment in which the lake would initially be embedded in a narrower rift valley and evolve to a lake enclosed within a progressively wider basin during the sag phase To test this scenario in a numerical model a few other additional constraints must be addressed ﬁrst The numerical values chosen to run the mass balance models based on Eq 4 are bound to a limited array of data acquired directly from the sampled material and to a few assumptions that need to be made and which are detailed below First there is a lack of direct evidence with respect to the precise lithological composition of the basement of Santos Basin Information regarding the isotopic composition of these rocks is even scarcer To the best of our knowledge the best available data come from published studies referring to outcrops along the coast of Rio de Janeiro State and from inferences based upon aeromagnetic data For instance studies indicate that orthogneisses of tonalitic to syenogranitic composition associated to high grade metamorphic rocks constitute the Precambrian basement of Santos Basin belonging to the Cabo Frio tectonic domain Schmitt et al 2008 Zalán and Oliveira 2005 The origin of this domain is not well known and it has been proposed that it would be related to the São Francisco Craton margin a relict of the Congo Craton in West Africa or to a separate microcontinent Valladares et al 2008 Schmitt et al 2008 The most incisive evidence regarding the nature and the Sr isotopic composition of the basement rocks comes from the study of Tupinambá et al 2012 who studied in greater detail the rocks of the Rio Negro Complex of the Ribeira Fold Belt The latter consists of a plutonic portion of a magmatic arc emplaced by the subduction of the ESE border of the São Francisco palaeoplate during the amalgamation of the Western Gondwana These authors have shown a variable range of 87Sr 86Sr ratio values covering the spectrum from more maﬁc components to more felsic ones Tupinambá et al 2012 Tedeschi 2017 recalculated the 87Sr 86Sr ratios provided by the latter authors to ages of 113 and 130 Ma showing this suite of Neoproterozoic rocks should have had 87Sr 86Sr ratios in the range between approximately 0 704 0 735 with a median value of 0 711 at 113 Ma and a slightly higher median of ca 0 713 at 130 Ma There is also evidence for the ﬂood basalts that overlie Precambrian basement in the Campos Basin and the nearby ﬂood basalts from the Paraná Basin Both have been sampled and comprise tholeiitic basalts with corrected 87Sr 86Sr from the former ranging between 0 70586 and 0 70926 and a single sample with 0 71892 Mizusaki et al 1992 whereas the latter shows a larger range in isotopic composition from 0 70483 to 0 71151 Peate and Hawkesworth 1996 Peate et al 1999 The basalts of the Camboriú Formation in the Santos Basin are stratigraphically correlated to those of the Campos Basin Moreira et al 2007 in such a way that similar isotopic compositions may be expected More recently there has been the suggestion based on seismic interpretation that the basalts of the Paraná Basin as well as a signiﬁcant sedimentary succession of the latter may constitute part of the basement of the Santos Basin Zalán 2017 Another evidence concerning the palaeo lake basement rocks comes from recent studies published by Wright 2012 and Wright and Barnett 2015 that discuss the occurrence of Mg silicate minerals in association with the carbonates The authors point out that the occurrence of these tri octahedral silicates together with calcite is an indication of lakes 74

Palaeogeography Palaeoclimatology Palaeoecology 507 2018 60 80 R Pietzsch et al range below 10 106 mol year Conversely in the case in which Fm has the starting condition of 29 45 106 mol year and decreases regularly to the top but no less than one order of magnitude Ff actually increases considerably in some intervals in order to maintain the values of 87Sr 86Sr observed in the carbonate samples Fig 11B D Regardless of this diﬀerence in particular both sets of modelled conditions show that Ff should have become the prevailing ﬂux very early in the history of evolution of the basin as determined from these initial conditions This diﬀerence between the two main results A C and B D also highlights that at least two distinct conditions might explain the observed 87Sr 86Sr values in the carbonates the decrease of both Ff and Fm with time suggests that depending on the lithology exposed or underlying the lake basin either runoﬀ or groundwater inﬂux or both decreased results A and C in which Fm shows an overall decrease for all the three conditions considered for Ff On the other hand results B and D show in general an increase in the values of Ff with time at the expenses of progressively lower Fm values The suggestion in the models derived from the initial conditions in Fig 11B D is that the ﬂux Ff was predominantly derived from groundwaters in contact with felsic rocks since there is no sedimentologic evidence for detrital transport From approximately the middle part of the Barra Velha Fm onwards Ff falls abruptly but recovers towards the top although there are recurrent falls along the way Several episodes of greater ﬂuxes appear to have occurred reaching its greater value of 1274 106 mol year in the model considering constant ﬂuxes derived from maﬁc sources black circles in Fig 11B D after which Ff decreases abruptly towards the top of the studied sequence The ﬂux of Sr from felsic sources apparently decreased to a background value no greater than ca 15 and 190 106 mol year in the uppermost Barra Velha Fm considering the corresponding ﬂux of Fm that yields the bigger Ff values i e constant Fm through time Considering the other extreme used in these models i e Fm decreasing one order of magnitude Ff falls more pronouncedly after the intermediate portion of the Barra Velha Fm despite showing the same high frequency pattern between alternating episodes of fall and followed by increase in its ﬂuxes red diamonds in Fig 11B D Notwithstanding the compilation of all results shows that Ff should have been indeed higher than Fm for most of the time and might even have increased relative to the latter during the evolution of the lake system From the point of view of the data discussed so far and the geological evolution of the basin this scenario implies that whatever the origin of the ﬂuids was meteoric or groundwater they likely reacted progressively more with felsic rocks with evolution of time Since other geological observations suggest low riverine input as derived from sedimentological and micropalaeontological data for instance this might be an indication that water recharge to the lake occurred mainly from groundwater interacting with basement rocks or their detrital derivatives Hence the synthesis provided by the quantitative models that better adjusts to the geochemical sedimentological and micropalaeontological observations points to progressively lower riverine and somewhat subtle declining subsurface ﬂuxes with time in a broader sense Eventually in shorter term cycles ﬂuxes may have increased momentarily although the main trend seems to have been of general decrease One point worth mentioning is that testing the models for the two scenarios with respect to time and all the rest being equal A versus C and B versus D shows that the inﬂux trends are conserved generally resulting only in negligible changes in the corresponding magnitudes Although the trends in both scenarios are equivalent the rate of change in scenario 2 is nearly one order of magnitude greater in general Hence this is a necessary consequence that the inﬂuxes of Sr would have to change signiﬁcantly faster in the latter case in order to maintain the isotopic mass balance in the lake In yet another calculation Fig 11 upper axes we reversed the initial ﬂuxes attributing the value of 7 4 106 mol year for Fm and the value of 29 45 106 mol year for Ff respectively In the results according to models displayed in Fig 11 upper axes it is shown that only which it decreases one order of magnitude from beginning to end The lake water 87Sr 86Sr ratio Rlw is taken as equal to the corrected initial 87Sr 86Sr ratio determined from the analyses of the carbonates samples Because the 87Sr 86Sr ratio is not subjected to isotopic fractionation the depositional signal is not expected to have changed signiﬁcantly Unless a later ﬂuid with distinct isotopic ratio interacted with the host rocks represented by the deposited material favouring dissolution and recrystallization of later phases with a diﬀerent isotopic composition However as extensively discussed above the geochemical data and petrographic observations along with the recovery of wellpreserved fossils are conspicuous evidences that support the view that no signiﬁcant alteration occurred under burial regime and therefore these rocks generally preserve their depositional Sr isotopic composition In order to reproduce the corrected strontium isotope curve and to avoid meaningless output i e negative ﬂuxes we are not allowed many degrees of freedom with respect to the choice of the input parameters if we strictly consider two end members alone Following this reasoning the choice of Rm and Rf cannot be entirely arbitrary even if there are not enough data to constrain an average value for the overall lithologies that constituted the basin in which the lake was enclosed Notwithstanding the values we chose are not unrealistic and their choice is considerably conservative with Rm 0 706 and Rf 0 714 close to the median values of the end members established so far The average value of Rm could have been lower as seen from available 87 Sr 86Sr data from basalts and other maﬁc rocks in adjacent areas Mizusaki et al 1992 Peate and Hawkesworth 1996 Peate et al 1999 Tupinambá et al 2012 Moreover the average value of Rf could have been considerably higher than the one adopted here as observed from data published by Tupinambá et al 2012 However the choice of values within a close range to those ones does not result in any signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the output trends the latter being our main concern rather than inferring as precise as possible absolute ﬂux values The results from these distinct conditions are plotted in Fig 11A B age model scenario 1 and Fig 11C D age model scenario 2 respectively We can see that for the established initial input of Sr equal to 7 4 106 mol year for Ff there is a peak inﬂux Fm at the bottom of the interval in the order of 11 106 mol year Fig 11A C The continuous dotted and dashed and dashed lines represent the input Ff values and the curves with black circles green squares and red diamonds the ﬂuxes derived from maﬁc sources that are needed to account in the given conditions for the 87Sr 86Sr that we have determined in the carbonate samples It can be observed that in general Fm decreases with time in all circumstances although a few lower pulses occur in the Jiquiá and in the Alagoas In the case in which the ﬂux Ff is left to decrease constantly one order of magnitude with time red dashed line Fm reaches a minimum modelled range in the order of 0 3 1 105 mol year close to the top of the studied succession remaining nearly within this range until the salt above Considering the three diﬀerent modelled conditions the overall modelled range of the ﬂux Fm lies between 0 2 105 and 11 106 mol year with median 0 2 1 106 mol year during the span of time considered In Fig 11B D the input parameters are reversed Fluxes derived from maﬁc sources are either held constant or allowed to decrease half its initial value and one order of magnitude with time from the initial value of 29 45 106 mol year continuous dotted and dashed and dashed lines respectively The corresponding ﬂuxes derived from felsic sources are represented by the curves with black circles green squares and red diamonds respectively Overall the latter ﬂuxes vary within the range of ca 16 1274 106 mol year median 52 203 106 mol year between models In the models in which Ff is allowed to decrease at regular rates from the starting condition of 7 4 106 mol year the Fm also decreases fairly regularly presenting some pulses along the way Fig 11A C Nevertheless both ﬂuxes conform in the sense that they continuously decrease with time in the 77

Wright Barnett 2017a b and or re worked grainstones rudstones Re worked carbonate spherules also occur in wackestone packstone textures but are comparatively rare The up section transition from laminated calcimudstones to spherulite dominated lithologies is transitional and is marked by rare laminae of carbonate spherules within the calcimudstones which become progressively more abundant eventually forming the spherulite dominated facies described above This facies association is interpreted to represent evaporation of the lake water body and a concomitant decrease in lake level This is suggested by the widespread presence of stevensite and other Mg silicate clay minerals in this facies association In fact available evidence suggests that a Mgsilicate matrix was originally ubiquitous and was subsequently removed by dissolution Wright Barnett 2015 2017a b 3 Shrubs Lithofacies Association 2 Spherulites Lithofacies Calcimudstones 1 A Massive to poorly laminated B Well

Tosca 2018 suggest that spherulitic carbonates and Mg silicate clays like those observed in the Barra Velha Formation were likely precipitation from elevated pH ca 10 10 5 waters based on their real time observations of in situ fluid chemistry post experiment analysis of precipitated solids and geochemical modelling That the spherulite dominated facies association represents less hospitable higher pH conditions is supported by the paucity of well preserved vertebrates and their stratigraphic restriction to the lower parts of individual beds near or at the laminitespherulite transition Progressive evaporation of a common water body is also suggested by carbon and oxygen stable isotope data The isotopic composition of primary carbonates moves along a covariant trend in response to changes in hydrological balance and water residence times Carbonates precipitated during periods of high lake level will in general plot towards the negative end of the trend those precipitated during lake level lows towards the positive end Talbot 1990 This is exactly the trend shown by micro sampled laminites and calcite spherules in the Barra Velha Formation 5 Grainstones 1 Calcimudstones 3 A

framestones or cementstones sensu Wright 1992 with or without Mg silicate clay and or re worked grainstones rudstones Re worked shrubs also occur in wackestone packstone textures but as with the spherulitedominated facies are comparatively rare The up section transition from spherulite to shrub dominated facies is transitional and in some occurrences the two components are interlaminated giving a mixed shrub spherulite facies The transitional nature of this transition is also apparent at the porescale at which spherules are observed to become increasingly asymmetric representing a transitional spherule shrub graintype The palaeo environmental conditions that tend to favour shrub precipitation over that of spherules are unclear An additional facies forms the uppermost parts of the cycles but is only well developed where the Barra Velha Formation shows marked thinning in the up dip areas of tilted fault blocks for example 2018 Shell International Exploration and Production B

Origin and significance of thick carbonate grainstone packages in non marine successions a case study from the Barra Velha Formation Santos Basin Andrew J Barnett Michael Obermaier Joachim Amthor Kaluan Juk Raphael Camara Mohammad Sharafodin Matt Bolton Thick Carbonate Grainstones While much of the Barra Velha Formation can be interpreted in terms of the cycle model opposite locally thick decametre scale continuous packages of grainstone and rudstone occur comprising fragments of crystal shrubs spherulites intraclasts and in some cases peloids and volcanic fragments These cannot be readily explained by the cycle model because lacustrine shoreline grainstones and rudstones tend to be relatively thin compared to those from marine basins due to limited fetch reducing wave action and producing a shallow wave base This effect is especially marked in low gradient endorheic lakes in which rapid lake level oscillations preclude the development of a stable shoreline Grainstones and rudstones of this type occur in two distinct settings 1 associated with unconformities on the escarpment and dip slopes of tilted fault blocks along which a marked thinning of the Barra Velha Fm is evident 2 apparent debris aprons adjacent to seismically resolvable mounds that developed on narrow elongate fault blocks 1 Grainstones Associated with Unconformities and Stratal Thinning Grainstones and rudstones associated with unconformities and thinning of the Barra Velha Formation form sharp based packages mostly showing fining upwards trends Grain size is mainly medium to coarse grained but is locally up to granule to pebble size in the rudstone textures at the base of fining upwards packages Grain size also shows a relationship to structural setting with grainstones deposited on steeper escarpment slopes being coarse than those on gentler dip slopes Component grains are generally well sorted and wellrounded The dominant physical sedimentary structures are planar and low angle stratification but cross lamination and planar cross bedding is locally present Palaeocurrents are normal to palaeoslope and show a radial pattern Core plug measurements indicate porosities of up to 25 but moderate permeability ranging from 1 mD to ca 100 mD Dip slope Escarpment slope C 200 m B Cyclic lake deposits A Frequencies Grainstones of this type are interpreted as carbonate fan delta shorelines with wave reworked sheet flood or terminal splay deposits This is consistent with the radial palaeoslope normal palaeocurrent patterns the degree of grain abrasion and the thickness of the grainstone successions which would be more difficult to explain in a wholly lacustrine environment The escarpment slope vs dip slope grain size variations are analogous to those observed in silicilclastic alluvial fan environments in which steeper depositional gradients are generally associated with coarser grain size N Cumulative Frequencies D 1m N E Degrees S Fig 5 A Seismic section

Resolvable Mounds Grainstones and rudstones of this type are interpreted as colluvial wedges or debris aprons formed as a result of the sub aerial disaggregation of mounds formed largely of crystal shrubs This is supported by their relative textural immaturity predominantly monomictic grain composition steep depositional dips and their association with seismically resolvable mound like features A B C 400 m Deposits associated with seismically resolvable mound like features comprise grainstones rudstones and less commonly packstones and floatstones The dominant grain types are re worked shrubs with platy angular and well rounded intraclasts mainly comprising cm to dm scale fragments of in situ shrub framestones Re worked spherulites occur but are distinctly less common than shrubs Grain size is mainly coarse to very coarse grained but up to granule to pebble grade and greater in rudstone textures Sorting is poor to moderate with subrounded to rounded grains Beds are normally graded but mainly lack internal stratification Planar to low angle lamination and very rarely crosslamination are locally developed Bed contacts are sharp and planar or irregular commonly with cmscale relief Packages of beds commonly show elevated dips of ca 20 40 Core plug measurements indicate good reservoir quality with up to 25 porosity within predominantly intergranular pore space and

156 BARNETT ET AL INTRODUCTION The pre salt successions of the Santos Basin contain estimated recoverable hydrocarbon volumes in excess of 30 BBOE according to Agencia Nacional do Petroleo The majority of these volumes are hosted in the Barra Velha Formation BVF Consequently the BVF and equivalent units have been the focus of considerable research efforts not just in Brazilian basins but also along the conjugate margin e g Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Saller et al 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 However most of this research has been aimed at understanding the unusual in situ carbonate components despite the fact that these are commonly reworked and locally form thick decameter scale successions of detrital deposits which can also have good reservoir properties Barnett et al 2018 Explaining thick decameter scale continuous packages of grain supported detrital carbonate rocks in apparent lacustrine settings is difficult because the limited fetch that characterizes lacustrine basins compared to marine basins results in reduced wave action and a relatively shallow wave base This effect is especially marked in low gradient endorheic lakes in which rapid lake level oscillations preclude the development of a stable shoreline Talbot and Allen 1996 As a result lacustrine shoreline g rainstones tend to be relatively thin the thickest units ca 14 m known to the authors being those documented by Milroy and Wright 2000 The aim of this chapter is to document the structural and stratigraphic setting of thick stacked successions of grainstones and rudstones from a producing field in the Santos Basin Figure 1 and based on their Figure 1 Base salt top reservoir structure map showing the structure and the location of the wells used in this study Contour interval is 100 m A A is the line of the seismic section shown in Figure 4

168 BARNETT ET AL decrease in wave and or current energy during deposition following an initial phase of erosion The absence of any significant relief or dip on the basal erosion surfaces suggests that the flows responsible were not confined to channels Episodic breaks in the deposition of detrital sediments is indicated by the colonization of the sediment surface by microbial mats as recorded by the presence of crinkly laminated micritic laminae with clotted peloidal and porostromate fabrics Lithofacies 4A Table 1 The presence of in situ shrub laminae within beds of grainstone and the local interbedding of other lacustrine facies Figures 5 6B Table 1 indicates that whatever the depositional environment of the grainstones it was time equivalent to and intimately associated with the better documented shrub spherulite and calcimudstone dominated lithofacies associations Table 1 As noted earlier the dominant form of stratification is planar to low angle lamination This preferentially occurs in the upper finer grained parts of the fining upward cycles in well C and the generally finer grained grainstones of well A In sand grade sediments that lack significant quantities of mica and are finer than ca 600 µm flatbeds with parallel lamination indicate upper flow regime conditions Collinson and Mountney 2019 Many closed lakes in arid and semiarid climates are fringed by alluvial fans Talbot and Allen 1996 Renaut and Gierlowski Kordesch 2010 The earlier observations would be consistent with sheet floods upward fining cycles lack of evidence of channels upper flow regime conditions on an alluvial fan radial paleocurrent patterns orientated down paleoslope sourced from an upland composed of previously deposited lacustrine carbonates However other lines of evidence are inconsistent with this interpretation most notably the degree of rounding and sorting shown by the grainstones Because of the episodic nature of sediment transport and the limited sediment transport distance typical of alluvial fans the resulting deposits are commonly poorly sorted with variable grain rounding and sometimes a depositional silt or clay grade matrix In contrast one of the most striking characteristics of many of the grainstones described here is that they are remarkably well rounded and sorted with a high degree of grain sphericity Furthermore the scenario outlined earlier does not explain several features of the grainstones First the local presence of coated grains like superficial ooids testifies to prolonged continuous grain movement not the type of episodic transport characteristic of a flash flood Coated grains lack truncated cements and are not fragmented suggesting that they are formed in situ and were not reworked from preexisting limestones Second although paleocurrents from planar cross bed sets in well C are consistent with radial down paleoslope flow on an alluvial fan Figure 10B those in well A show a marked southerly trend which would be oblique onshore to any downslope prograding fan at that location Figure 10D Planar lakeward dipping lamination is typical of unidirectional backwash in foreshore environments and can also be caused by high energy waves in the surf zone along both lacustrine and marine shorelines Reading and Collinson 1996 Collinson and Mountney 2019 Such an interpretation would not only explain basinward depositional dips Figure 10 but would also provide the more continuous agitation required to explain the textural maturity of the grainstones and the local presence of coated grains Furthermore oblique onshore paleocurrent patterns from planar cross bedding can readily be explained by the wave driven migration of sandwaves whereas downslope sediment transport by debris flows and sheet floods cannot The grainstones and rudstones described herein are therefore interpreted as high energy wave dominated shoreline deposits derived from the disaggregation and reworking of mainly shrub and spherulite dominated limestones Prograding shoreline deposits in both siliciclastic Reading and Collinson 1996 and carbonate environments Ward and Brady 1979 Milroy and Wright 2000 typically show coarsening upward trends The dominance of fining upward trends in the BVF grainstones therefore requires some explanation One possibility is that they represent transgressive shoreline deposits recording lake deepening and shoreline retreat Indeed the progressive onlap of the BVF shown in Figure 4 indicates an overall transgressive trend at the formation 102 m scale However even within this longer term transgression one would expect higher frequency regressive events to produce smaller scale meter scale or thinner coarsening upward packages especially if the BVF lake was subject to frequent flooding evaporation cycles Figure 3 A nother possibility therefore is that the relative scarcity of coarsening upward cycles is because of frequent cycle truncation by erosion prior to deposition of the following cycle This is supported by the sharp bases of each of the cycles and the immediately overlying intraclast lag Discussion The grainstones and rudstones documented in this chapter occur within successions greater than 160 m thick in which they make up well over 50 of the

Origin and Significance of Thick Carbonate Grainstone Packages in Nonmarine Successions Barra Velha Formation 169 facies present Individual and continuous packages of stacked grainstones up to 15 4 m thick are observed in the cored interval of well C and if the sidewall core sampling in this well is representative then continuous successions of grainstone may exceed 22 m Figure 5 Furthermore the grainstone dominated facies belt extends ca 40 km along strike Figure 1 Consequently grainstones of the type described earlier are locally at least a major component of the BVF depositional system and can form high quality reservoirs Some of the samples described in this chapter have porosity up to 19 Nevertheless they have received little attention in previous studies with most workers focusing on the in situ components of the BVF and similar age equivalent units especially the shrubs and spherulites e g Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 Successions greater than 160 m thick dominated by high energy grainstone deposits would be noteworthy in a marine basin cf Burchette et al 1990 However they are particularly unusual in a lacustrine basin where the relatively limited fetch would result in reduced wave energy compared to marine equivalents This is especially true in low gradient closed or endorheic lakes in which rapid and frequent lake level changes can prevent the establishment of stable shorelines Talbot and Allen 1996 Although the gradient of the BVF lake clearly varied through time because of both local faulting and the regional shift from rifting to thermal sag subsidence many workers favor a closed lake depositional environment especially for that part of the formation above the IAU Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Pietzsch et al 2018 Farias et al 2019 Consequently the origin of thick stacked high energy grainstones in both footwall and hanging wall structural settings requires some explanation In the preceding section we concluded that the grainstones were produced by the reworking of mainly shrub and spherulite dominated deposits along a high energy shoreline At the formation scale depositional dips within grainstone dominated successions show a radial fan like and lakeward dipping pattern in wells drilled on both the escarpment and dip slopes Figure 10A C The grainstone bodies therefore appear to have a lobate or fan like morphology However a mechanism is required to generate and concentrate large amounts of carbonate sand and gravel at the shoreline to produce successions of the type and thickness described Although waves are important in reworking winnowing and transporting sediment they are unlikely to be an efficient mechanism for concentrating significant thicknesses of sand and gravel at one location because as already noted the fair weather wave base is likely to migrate laterally over considerable distances in response to rapid and frequent lake level changes All of the earlier observations can be reconciled in a fan delta environment In this chapter we follow McPherson et al 1987 in defining a fan delta as an ater alluvial fan that builds into a standing body of w It follows from this definition and the observation that alluvial fans commonly occur along the margins of closed lakes in arid and semiarid climates that fan deltas are similarly common in such settings The presence of water bodies marginal to fans can affect fan development in several ways Of relevance in this case is the fact that fans can be significantly eroded by waves or longshore currents where they adjoin a water body and beach shoreface or longshore drift deposits such as spits may develop Where this is observed to occur the resulting deposits show significantly greater textural maturity than upslope alluvial fan deposits that have not been subject to waves or longshore currents Horton and Schmitt 1996 Blair and McPherson 2008 As such a fan delta environment provides the necessary mechanism for the degree of sorting and rounding observed in the BVF grainstones as wells as the suite of observed sedimentary structures and the fanlike morphologies of the grainstone dominated successions Such a setting is also consistent with the cycle truncation proposed in the preceding section to explain the dominance of fining upward over coarsening upward packages Repeated erosion and r eworking of shoreline deposits by flash floods would be expected in a fan delta environment Horton and Schmitt 1996 propose a similar mechanism to explain the apparent absence of progradational coarsening upward cycles in siliciclastic fan delta shoreline facies Furthermore pronounced changes in water depth as is typical in closed lakes can cause significant fan erosion and reworking over a large range of elevation For example in Walker Lake Nevada the position of wave reworking fluctuated over a vertical range of 157 m during the past 18 kyr producing complex interfingering of subaerial and lake shoreline facies across a 1700 m radial belt In other words a fan delta provides a mechanism for both the disaggregation and concentration of thick accumulations of sediment by subaerial erosion and downslope sediment transport as well as the intense winnowing of that sediment by waves on the distal nearshore part of the fan A possibly analogous environment is observed at Winnemucca Lake in Nevada where the subaerial exposure and subsequent erosion of spring mounds that developed in a sublacustrine environment between 13 Ka and 26 Ka have led to the development

Origin and Significance of Thick Carbonate Grainstone Packages in Nonmarine Successions Barra Velha Formation 171 claimed that strong abrasion during eolian transport greatly increases the roundness and sphericity of grains that were originally tabular because the low viscosity of air relative to water induces increased grain breakage and abrasion The current spherical morphology of grains that were originally elongated such as shrubs or bone fragments could be because of intense grain breakage and abrasion in an eolian environment prior to deposition The relatively long periods between major depositional episodes on the subaerial parts of fans or beach ridges make surficial sediment modification by secondary processes like wind commonplace In more extreme cases eolian sandsheets can form thick and laterally continuous blankets that disrupt or even terminate fan deposition Blair and McPherson 2009 Note that it is not being suggested that the grainstones described in this chapter are eolianites Clear examples of inversely graded laminae produced by the migration and climb of wind ripples climbing translatent stratification the most definitive criterion for recognizing eolianites regardless of original mineralogy Hunter 1977 Loope and Abegg 2001 are not common Conversely Kindler and Davaud 2001 observe that wind ripple strata are sometimes rare in carbonate eolianites that lack detrital quartz However adhesion ripples are also apparently absent and grains larger than ca 4 mm are common in rudstone fabrics at c ycle bases Both characteristics are inconsistent with an eolian depositional environment The idea that is being considered earlier is simply that the grain assemblage that now makes up the thick BVF grainstones was subject to eolian transport and resulting grain abrasion prior to deposition at the lake shoreline The apparent paucity of widespread paleosols in the BVF and equivalent units in the Campos Basin is surprising Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 although the presence of paleokarst in BVF successions with locally occurring seismically resolvable mounds has been suggested by Barnett et al 2018 Very little is known of the time periods required for the formation of calcimagnesian soils that is soils developed on carbonate substrates Duchaufour 1982 Wright 1994 However because of the abundant supply of carbonate it is likely that they form much more abruptly than those that develop on siliciclastic substrates such as the well dated calcretes of the southwest U S A Machette 1985 which can require 10 5 years to reach stage 4 Wright 1994 The above observation makes the lack of clear well developed pedogenic features in the BVF even more unusual One possible explanation is the prevailing paleoclimate during BVF deposition Although a soil moisture deficit is necessary to allow carbonate to accumulate and not to be flushed out of an incipient soil profile calcimagnesian soils do not form in very arid settings because there is not enough water passing through the soil to dissolve sufficient quantities of carbonate Furthermore the role of organic processes is critical because much of the available carbonate is probably precipitated through biological activity Extreme aridity would suppress vegetation which in addition would also retard other pedogenic processes such as brecciation much of which is thought to be caused by plant roots Wright 1994 One other explanation for the scarcity of paleosols is that the grainstones described herein are not shallow water deposits but were generated by deeper water currents cf Eberli et al 2019 However this is inconsistent with several features of the grainstones First as already noted their structural and stratigraphic context suggests a shallower setting as they occur where a thinning of the BVF is observed in association with a change in facies to grain supported detrital rocks with rounded to well rounded grains and cross stratification Second instead of being interbedded with profundal lake deposits as would be expected in a deeper lake setting the grainstones form decameter thick stacked packages lacking intercalations of such facies Where interbeds of other facies do occur they mainly comprise limited developments of the shrub spherulite and calcimudstone c ycles described in Figure 3 and Table 1 which become progressively better developed downdip Figure 12 All published work on the BVF to date suggest that the shrubs and spherulites represent relatively shallow closed lake deposits based on the following 1 The near absence of sand size siliciclastic sediment reflecting riverine input 2 A low diversity nonmarine ostracod fauna which becomes increasingly restricted up section in the BVF Pietzsch et al 2018 3 Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes that either show covariant trends Wright and Barnett 2017 Barnett et al 2018 or in the absence of covariance limited variation in δ13C but a wide range in δ18O values Pietzsch et al 2020 Although the earlier criteria are strong evidence that the BVF lakes were hydrologically closed and therefore probably tending to be relatively shallow caution is needed in trying to assign precise water depths The covariant trends in carbon and oxygen and stable isotopes documented by Talbot 1990 for example

Critically Evaluating the Current Depositional Models for the Pre Salt Barra Velha Formation Offshore Brazil V Paul Wright1 and Andrew Barnett2 Search and Discovery Article 51439 2017 Posted November 20 2017 Adapted from Keynote Address given at AAPG SEG International Conference and Exhibition London England October 15 18 2017 Datapages 2017 Serial rights given by author For all other rights contact author directly 1 PW Carbonate Geoscience Cardiff UK vpw pwcarbonategeoscience com Shell Canary Warf London UK 2 Abstract This presentation assesses approaches for evaluating the two contrasting models for the depositional settings for the Cretaceous Barra Velha Formation carbonate reservoirs of Santos Basin and their impact upon exploration strategies and reservoir modelling One model invokes deeper lakes with differentiated microbial platforms having relief of hundreds of metres as well as smaller buildups The other model is of very shallow evaporitic hyper alkaline lakes with predominantly abiotic carbonate and Mg silicate precipitates The case for the former has been based on the perceived presence of shelf like margins resembling marine carbonate platforms whereas the latter is based on detailed sedimentological analysis from a large data set supported by geochemical modelling The hydrology of the Barra Velha lakes can be assessed by proxy using carbon and oxygen stable isotopes by comparison with extensive studies from Quaternary lake deposits from East Africa Co variant trends in these Barra Velha isotopes suggest the former presence of shallow evaporitic lakes which were likely very extensive or sourced from a uniform aquifer Identifying isolated carbonate buildups is now facilitated by scoring using work flows but this approach relates to marine systems and may not be appropriate for nonmarine ones as the absence of modern or ancient large scale nonmarine buildups limits this approach Instead the evidence shows that the large platform like features are largely post Barra Velha and structural in origin affected by varying degrees of subaerial erosion denudation While available sedimentological and geochemical evidence does not support the presence of platform like features with hundreds of metres of relief this does not preclude the presence of large carbonate mounds and ridges analogous to those seen in modern extensional systems However as such features can be sub lacustrine subaerial or periodically both their presence and interpreted relief cannot be used to draw reliable conclusions about palaeobathymetry

t Technical papers Multiattribute framework analysis for the identification of carbonate mounds in the Brazilian presalt zone Carlos Jesus1 Maria Olho Azul2 Wagner Moreira Lupinacci3 and Leandro Machado4 Abstract Carbonate mounds as described herein often present seismic characteristics such as low amplitude and a high density of faults and fractures which can easily be oversampled and blur other rock features in simple geobody extraction processes We have developed a workflow for combining geometric attributes and hybrid spectral decomposition HSD to efficiently identify good quality reservoirs in carbonate mounds within the complex environment of the Brazilian presalt zone To better identify these reservoirs within the seismic volume of carbonate mounds we divide our methodology into four stages seismic data acquisition and processing overview preconditioning of seismic data using structural oriented filtering and imaging enhancement calculation of seismic attributes and classification of seismic facies Although coherence and curvature attributes are often used to identify high density fault and fracture zones representing one of the most important features of carbonate mounds HSD is necessary to discriminate low amplitude carbonate mounds good reservoir quality from low amplitude clay zones nonreservoir Finally we use a multiattribute facies classification to generate a geologically significant outcome and to guide a final geobody extraction that is calibrated by well data and that can be used as a spatial indicator of the distribution of good reservoir quality for static modeling Introduction Brazil has been producing oil from presalt carbonate reservoirs over the past decade Recently these reservoirs attained an incredible output of just more than 1 7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day representing more than half of the country s daily production and demonstrating the importance of these carbonate reservoirs to Brazil However it is tremendously challenging to map and characterize these carbonate reservoirs given their considerable spatial heterogeneity complex pore systems and often ambiguous seismic responses Burgess et al 2013 define criteria for discriminating different carbonate features in a seismic image that involve regional constraints analysis of basic seismic geometries and analyses of geophysical details and finer scale seismic geometries For the purpose of this work we adopted analyses of seismic geometries and geophysical details as well as amplitude anomalies and the behavior of frequencies in the reservoir interval together with the high density of faults and fractures to define carbonate features many of which were assessed at a subseismic scale Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Here we propose a workflow for identifying and characterizing carbonate mounds in the Brazilian presalt zone using a combination of hybrid spectral decomposition HSD together with geometric attributes and curvature and coherence attributes For this work we use the term carbonate mounds to describe almost conical carbonate bodies of pronounced relief that are often difficult to map seismically due to their ambiguous limits and internal low amplitude reflectors but that exhibit excellent reservoir quality in terms of matrix and associated fracturing and that have been successfully drilled evaluated and tested It is beyond the scope of this work to interpret these features further or to establish their depositional environment For a broader perception of the many interpretations of these presalt carbonates we suggest amongst others the works of Wright and Barnett 2017 on Barra Velha Formation depositional systems Buckley et al 2015 on early Cretaceous lacustrine carbonate platforms Wright and Barnett 2017 on depositional models for the presalt Barra Velha Formation and Wright and Rodriguez 2018 on depositional interpretations of presalt environments and their links to seismic facies Our 1 Petrogal Brasil S A Rio de Janeiro Brazil and Universidade Federal Fluminense Niteroi Brazil E mail carlosfzk gmail com Petrogal Brasil S A Rio de Janeiro Brazil E mail mariaolhoazul petrogalbrasil com 3 Universidade Federal Fluminense Niteroi Brazil E mail wagnerlupinacci id uff br 4 Emerson Automation Solutions Rio de Janeiro Brazil E mail leandro machado emerson com Manuscript received by the Editor 3 January 2018 revised manuscript received 10 November 2018 published ahead of production 08 February 2019 published online 01 April 2019 This paper appears in Interpretation Vol 7 No 2 May 2019 p T467 T476 12 FIGS 2 TABLES 2 http dx doi org 10 1190 INT 2018 0004 1 2019 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and American Association of Petroleum Geologists All rights reserved Interpretation May 2019 T467 Downloaded from https pubs geoscienceworld org interpretation article pdf 7 2 T467 4698394 int 2018 0004 1 pdf by Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul user

workflow is focused on characterizing seismic facies and their relationship to present day reservoir quality which we believe can be applied and adjusted to different settings within the Brazilian presalt sequence Our intent is to detail a workflow that can facilitate mapping of present day good reservoir quality carbonate mound geometries to enable their characterization from a seismic perspective and to allow assessment of their spatial distribution for the purposes of reservoir modeling during the exploration and appraisal stages Seismic attenuation can greatly affect the quality of seismic signals perpetuated at considerable depths Lupinacci and Oliveira 2015 Yuan et al 2017 Consequently mapping carbonate mounds in the Brazilian presalt fields which lie at depths ranging between 5000 and 6000 m and below an approximately 2000 m thick layer of salt is a major challenge for geoscientists because of low seismic illumination and low amplitude anomalies low impedance and the high fault and fracture density that are characteristic of these geologic features It is difficult to identify and delineate such features in these presalt fields using only seismic data because of the complexity of the seismic image generated and the absence of impedance contrast between the reservoir and adjacent sealing facies Zheng et al 2007 Despite many criteria for presalt seismic data having already been defined we consider in this study that general information about the acquisition and processing of such data is essential to understanding its ambiguities and limitations Furthermore because seismic data can be contaminated by random and coherent noise arising from data acquisition or complex geology that can bias results even after data processing and migration Chopra and Marfurt 2007 data preconditioning is crucial to obtain good results Lupinacci et al 2017 With respect to carbonate reservoir characterization seismic facies analysis is increasingly seen as an effective way of estimating reservoir properties Matos et al 2007 combining different seismic attributes through pattern recognition algorithms such as seismic multiattributes analysis Rongchang et al 2017 to identify for example lateral changes in a reservoir Seismic attributes are important tools for reservoir characterization that can help to visually enhance or quantify features of interest Chopra and Marfurt 2007 However selection of seismic attributes for analysis should be made with caution so as not to propagate false interpretations Curvature and coherence attributes can be used together in seismic multiattribute analyses to increase the reliability of this type of geologic analysis The curvature attribute describes how bent a curve is at a point along its length Roberts 2001 focusing on changes in shape This attribute is a good predictor of faults as well as anticline and syncline structures Klein et al 2008 because it is not affected by variations in amplitude related to changes in lithology and fluid The coherence cube attribute a measure of the similarity between neighboring seismic traces in three dimensions has been used since 1995 Bahorich and Farmer 1995 as a powerful seismic interpretation tool for imaging geologic discontinuities such as faults and fractures which are recurrently associated with carbonate mound features in this study area However many ways of calculating coherence can be implemented Here we applied the eigenvalue coherence algorithm Gersztenkorn and Marfurt 1999 Marfurt et al 1999 which uses several adjacent traces within a local window to estimate discontinuity for each sample Spectral decomposition is another widely used attribute for identifying seismic patterns It can represent the seismic trace in a frequency domain or in subbands of frequencies It can be used to identify subtle thickness variations and discontinuities as well as to predict bedding thicknesses e g Partyka et al 1999 Spectral decomposition can also be used to identify low frequency shadow which may indicate the presence of hydrocarbons Sun et al 2002 Wang 2007 or as in this study to identify good quality reservoirs upon calibration by the well log porosity response Additionally a frequency bandwidth related to seismic facies can be selected from a spectral decomposition analysis so a specific amplitude range can be isolated that represents a reservoir anomaly called HSD Jesus et al 2017 Pattern recognition and classification of seismic features is fundamental to seismic data interpretation Zhao et al 2015 so uniting different criteria through several seismic attributes and establishing seismic facies classes is an excellent approach for isolating reservoirs of good quality in presalt carbonate mounds from shale or tight zones nonreservoir We propose a workflow for identifying and characterizing carbonate mounds in the Brazilian presalt zone using a combination of HSD with curvature and coherence geometric attributes We chose those attributes because of their ability to provide useful geologic information and used them to generate a seismic facies classification to specifically identify good quality reservoirs in carbonate mounds The extracted geobody was then used as a spatial indicator of the distribution of porosity in the reservoir Methodology As described in Burgess et al 2013 there is no clear set of diagnostic criteria for identifying many specific carbonate features especially in frontier regions From a geophysical perspective the Brazilian presalt zone is still a frontier area and given the influence of salt thickness on image quality of seismic data seismic acquisition and processing details need to be carefully understood prior to performing any proposed methodology for seismic data interpretation Our workflow starts with preconditioning of the seismic data Figure 1 using structural oriented filtering SOF to remove some background noise and preserve fault edges The SOF volume is

the curvature attribute In parallel and to improve the overall vertical resolution an image enhancement is applied to the SOF volume to calculate a coherence cube which facilitates better identification of the faulted and fractured character of these presalt carbonate mounds We also apply HSD to the SOF volume to identify low amplitude zones which correspond to areas of good porosity All of these seismic attributes are then combined to classify the seismic facies which allow us to distinguish the most important facies representing good reservoir quality carbonate mounds and to extract a geobody that can then be used as a spatial control for porosity distribution in reservoir modeling Our methodology for characterizing carbonate mounds is thus divided into four stages 1 seismic data acquisition and processing overview 2 preconditioning of seismic data 3 calculation of seismic attributes and 4 classification of seismic facies We describe these processing stages in detail in the following sections Seismic data acquisition and processing overview The seismic acquisition was performed in 2013 from a single vessel equipped with 12 streamers 8000 m in length and dual sources The seismic data were recorded with an azimuth direction of 123 a sampling rate of 2 ms and a nominal fold of 80 Seismic acquisition parameters are presented in Table 1 Depth imaging and velocity model building VMB in deepwater environments with complex and large evaporated layers is challenging for seismic illumination These seismic acquisition parameters are not ideal for seismic illumination of presalt reservoirs Had the seismic data been acquired as broadband we could have applied a more efficient seismic processing The initial VMB was rendered on legacy data to obtain a more realistic and geologically relevant outcome by first applying an isotropic model for the initial step and then deriving a tilted transversal isotropic model from the tomographic data along with the seismic inversion Bakulin et al 2010 To decrease the well to seismic mistie we updated the anisotropy models based on the well markers Another important strategy we adopted for the VMB was to divide the salt layer using intermediate horizons that separated stratified salt from homogeneous salt The background starting salt velocity for the tomography was 4500 m s and then we applied a weighted mask to guide the tomography and produce a stronger update in the stratified salt layer This strategy made it possible to establish a more precise velocity model for the presalt zone Preconditioning of seismic data According to Höecker and Fehmers 2002 three premises are required to apply filters successfully on poststack seismic data orientation analysis edge detection and smoothing with edge preservation Furthermore considering the criteria we adopted in this case study which include amplitude frequency anoma lies geometry and fault and fracture density application of SOF should guarantee that the quality of the data improves without having to change the criteria To improve the quality of the seismic data contaminated with background noise we applied SOF and image enhancement Figure 2b and 2c to precondition the seismic data Qi et al 2014 Preconditioning should be concentrated in the region of interest The aim of SOF is to improve the lateral continuity of the seismic reflector and increase the signal to noise ratio The SOF algorithm applies volumetric dip and azimuth calculations to avoid smearing of faults fractures and other discontinuities using an overlapping window method Marfurt 2006 We used the SOF output to calculate an image enhancement through increasing the frequency bandwidth Bruce and Caldwell 2003 thereby bolstering weak frequencies to reduce the effect of attenuation Figure 2c This step could be considered a type of spectral enhancement the objective of which was to improve seismic resolution by increasing the frequency bandwidth This process does not create Seismic data Spectral decomposition Structure oriented filtering Hybrid spectral decompostion Image enhancement Curvature Coherence Figure 1 Steps used to calculate the seismic attributes Table 1 Acquisition parameters Acquisition parameters Shot interval Cell length Cell width Line orientation Near offset inline Source numbers Source separation Source depth Streamer numbers Streamer length Group interval Group length Streamer depth Streamer separation 25 m 6 25 m 12 5 m 123 or 303 150 m 2 25 m 7m 12 8000 m 12 5 m 12 5 m 9m 50 m Interpretation May 2019 T469 Downloaded from https pubs geoscienceworld org interpretation article pdf 7 2 T467 4698394 int 2018 0004 1 pdf by Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul user

new frequencies it only enhances the contribution of some frequencies existing within the seismic data to better define the reservoir architecture Calculation of seismic attributes The seismic attributes were calculated after SOF and image enhancement The curvature and spectral decomposition attributes were generated directly from SOF The coherence attribute was derived from the image enhancement step The HSD was obtained from the spectral decomposition step The steps for calculating the seismic attributes are shown in Figure 1 The curvature attribute describes how a surface deviates from being planar Figure 3 Basically it measures subtle lateral and vertical changes in dip that are often dominated by strong localized deformation for example carbonate reefs on 20 dipping surfaces can present the same curvature anomaly as a carbonate reef on a flat surface Chopra and Marfurt 2007 In this case study several curvature attributes were tested including the most positive most negative and dip curvatures We found that dip curvatures which are acquired by extracting the curvature in the direction of maximum dip presented the best result Volume curvature attributes can enhance seismic resolution providing more in Positive curvature 0 Anticline 0 0 0 Zero curvature Syncline z 0 x Negative curvature Figure 3 Curvature attribute in two dimensions indicating that this attribute is positive in an anticline negative in a syncline and zero in a flat or dipping plane b a 4 0 5 200 2 0 5 400 0 5 600 1 0 0 8 Amplitude 5 000 Depth m Figure 2 Preconditioning a Input b frequency content of input c SOF d frequency content of SOF e imaging enhancement and f frequency content of imaging enhancement sight into fault delineation and aiding in the prediction of fractures and their orientations Roberts 2001 Chopra and Marfurt 2007 The curvature attribute is very susceptible to noise so we calculated it after SOF The coherence attribute requires a central trace as a reference to make correlations between neighboring seismic traces using a vertical analysis window Figure 4 Geologically highly coherent seismic traces or waveforms indicate a laterally continuous lithology Abrupt changes in waveform can indicate faults and fractures in the sediments Chopra and Marfurt 0 6 0 4 0 2 2 0 5 800 2 km 0 6 000 4 0 5 000 4 0 30 40 50 60 2 0 5 400 0 5 600 50 60 50 60 1 0 0 8 Amplitude 5 200 Depth m 20 Frequency Hz d c 0 6 0 4 0 2 2 0 5 800 0 2 km 6 000 4 0 5 000 4 0 10 20 30 40 Frequency Hz f 5 200 2 0 5 400 0 5 600 2 0 1 0 0 8 Amplitude e Depth m 10 0 6 0 4 0 2 5 800 2 km 6 000 T470 Interpretation May 2019 Downloaded from https pubs geoscienceworld org interpretation article pdf 7 2 T467 4698394 int 2018 0004 1 pdf by Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul user 0 4 0 10 20 30 40 Frequency Hz

2007 According several tests it was possible to see that the difference between the curvature calculation results before and after image enhancement is that after image enhancement there is the risk of boost up some noise and this attribute is very sensitive to noise And coherence shows to be more effective after improvement of the resolution We used the coherence attribute to search along structural dips because it helps to reveal the true edges After we analyzed the dominant frequency and identified the frequency bandwidth that best represents the target we used HSD to decompose the seismic data into frequency bands This frequency bandwidth is selected to calculate the envelope attribute from which a specific amplitude range is isolated Jesus et al 2017 We obtained the HSD parameters after SOF application to maintain the proportionality of the amplitude and thereby preserve the reservoir anomalies To achieve an optiCrossline mized HSD for the area of interest two steps are required a sensitivity study stage 1 and an isolation study of frequency ranges and representative amplitudes stage 2 3 we identified the dominant frequency as being approximately 8 Hz Also as part of our sensitivity study and using the same interval we generated a root meansquare rms amplitude map to identify low amplitude zones which is a recurring characteristic of presalt carbonate mounds As illustrated in Figure 5b all wells except for well 4 are in low amplitude zones Stage 2 After our sensitivity study had revealed the frequency best representing the interval of interest and we had identified the respective low amplitude zones through stage 1 we could isolate the frequency and amplitude ranges by applying a short time Fourier transform STFT with a Hanning window for spectral Neighbour trace W Central trace Neighbour trace T Stage 1 For the sensitivity study performed between the top and base of the reservoir of interest we generated a dominant frequency attribute Figure 5a and selected the dominant frequency that best represented the reservoir interval By analyzing the dominant frequency map at well locations 1 2 and a Inline Figure 4 Spatial or multitrace analysis windows used to calculate the coherence attribute W is defined as the vertical analysis window for time T b c 17000 20 140 16000 Well 2 14000 12000 4 km 10000 N Well 2 Well 3 10 Well 4 4 km Well 2 100 Well 3 70 Well 4 4 km 5 N 35 N 8800 10 km Well 1 15 Magnitude Well 4 Well 1 Frequency Hz Well 3 Acoustic impedance m s g cm 3 Well 1 0 10 km 0 10 km Figure 5 a Acoustic impedance b dominant frequency and c rms amplitude maps Interpretation May 2019 T471 Downloaded from https pubs geoscienceworld org interpretation article pdf 7 2 T467 4698394 int 2018 0004 1 pdf by Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul user

decomposition of the SOF volume Figure 6 and decompose the seismic data into frequency subbands By knowing the representative frequency and well outcomes at the best well locations wells 1 3 and identifying the low amplitude zones for the presalt carbonate mounds being investigated we could isolate the frequency and amplitude associated with the carbonate mounds by selecting a dominant frequency subband of 8 Hz and then calculating an envelope attribute for this subband To define the interval for the envelope that represents these presalt carbonate mounds it was necessary to also use the acoustic impedance volume which assumes a low impedance occurrence in the mound zones represented by wells 1 3 whereas well 4 was defined as nonreservoir As well 4 also presented a high value for the 8 Hz envelope we established a cutoff to effectively isolate the carbonate mounds by combining the 8 Hz dominant frequency with the acoustic impedance volume representing a low impedance for the carbonate mounds Where the 8 Hz envelope and acoustic impedance presented low values the area was considered a carbonate mound but when only the envelope attribute value was low the area was considered a nonreservoir Table 2 We applied a maximum cutoff value of 0 27 for the envelope attribute to discriminate between reservoirs and nonreservoirs Finally the following script was applied to the envelope attribute for 8 Hz as the dominant frequency spectral decomposition to generate the HSD HSD ¼ IF Envelope Value ¼ 540 THEN Envelope ¼ Envelope ELSE Envelope ¼ 541 Accordingly if the envelope value was less than or equal to 540 then the value was retained to represent reservoirs otherwise the standard value of 541 was assigned representing nonreservoirs The spectral decomposition and HSD for the top reservoir horizon are shown in Figure 7 A southeast to northwest trend of low amplitude passing through wells 2 and 3 can be seen in Figure 7a which can be associated with the carbonate mounds Figure 7b reveals that HSD was better than spectral decomposition in identifying the main low amplitude trend corresponding to carbonate mounds wells 2 and 3 Figure 8 shows the main quality control of HSD where pseudolog data from HSD was extracted at each well location wells 1 4 and compared with the total porosity log rescaled to seismic output The quality control showed a good correlation between HSD pseudolog and total porosity so for low HSD values there is an inversely proportional high value for total porosity This outcome increases the confidence in our HSD Seismic facies classification Seismic facies can be defined as a group of seismic responses with characteristics that distinctly differ Table 2 Correlation between envelope and acoustic impedance Attributes Reservoir mounds Nonreservoir shale Envelope Acoustic impedance Low value Low value High value Low value 1 Figure 6 Schematic of stage 2 for optimization and application of HSD First the STFT is applied and a frequency band is selected Then the envelope attribute is calculated 8 Hz 1 Time s 4 1 km 6 Seismic data decomposition using STFT 6 1 km 1 15 Hz 4 1 Time s 1 Time s 4 Seismic data 1 1 km 6 33 Hz 1 Time s 4 1 6 Time s 1Km 6 T472 Interpretation May 2019 Downloaded from https pubs geoscienceworld org interpretation article pdf 7 2 T467 4698394 int 2018 0004 1 pdf by Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul user 2 Envelope attribute 1 Frequency band selected with a dominant frequency of 8 Hz 4 1 Time s 2 x10 4 3 1 km 6 1 km 1

352 Petersohn et al INTRODUCTION The Mero Field is located in the central part of the Santos Basin southeastern Brazil about 180 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in a water depth of approximately 2 000 m Figure 1 It was discovered in 2010 by the well 2 ANP 2A RJS drilled by Petrobras in partnership with the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels ANP In 2013 the Libra Block was offered in the first bid round executed by the Brazilian government under the new production sharing agreement for the pre salt areas In this block a large four way closure of more than 500 km2 trending northwest southeast was mapped The 2 ANP 2A well tested the northwest part of the structure and revealed a 327 m oil column in carbonate reservoirs displaying excellent porosity and permeability proprieties The consortium formed by Petrobras operator Shell Total CNOOC CNPC and PPSA won the bid The Libra Consortium is led by Petrobras with a 40 interest in partnership with Shell 20 Total 20 CNPC 10 and CNOOC Limited 10 Pré Sal Petróleo PPSA represents the Brazilian federal government on production sharing agreements Figure 2 shows the four areas identified in the Libra Block that divided by significant fault zones northwest central southeast and south The northwest compartment became the Mero Field whose declaration of commerciality was announced by the consortium on November 30 2017 Carlotto et al 2017 First oil is expected by 2021 The other compartments of the Libra Block are still under evaluation The isolated part of the structural closure representing the Mero Field along the western margin of the Libra Complex is apparent on the base of salt structure map Figures 2 3 Figure 1 Campos and Santos basin location map with bathymetric curves and blocks and oil fields currently under concession

358 Petersohn et al described as a coquinas sequence and grouped into the Itapema Formation The base of this sequence is characterized by layers of shale as sampled by several wells These shales are represented by reflectors of high negative amplitude and extensive lateral continuity in seismic data allowing correlation along the central part of Mero Field Figures 6 7 The well 3 BRSA 1339A RJS which was drilled in the western part of the Mero Field has identified a large amount of fine grained sedimentary rocks interspersed with coquinas whose layers can reach thickness of up to 100 m In the central part of the Mero Field layers of coquina can reach thicknesses of up to 400 m in the well 2 ANP 2A RJS where only a few of other interlayered rocks occur Coquina reservoirs exhibit chaotic to progradational seismic facies and mound geometries These mounds exhibit internal reflectors characterized by low amplitudes and minimal lateral continuity and are arranged as clinoforms showing a progradational pattern with directions ranging from northeast to northwest Figure 8 These clinoforms are cut by a positive horizontal reflector discordant with the local stratigraphy and coincident with the OWC identified in well 2 ANP 2A RJS The positive discordant reflector was interpreted as a flat spot and it is possible to track it throughout most of central part This extraordinary coquina thickness was deposited in a wide platform probably in shallow water environment developed over gently dipping northern and western flanks of a prominent basement high which occur in the central and eastern parts of the Mero Field Figure 9 The top of the coquina onlaps against the basement in seismic data Coquinas also occur in the eastern part of the Mero Field However they show some differences in relation to those described on the northern and western flanks The well 3 BRSA 1350 RJS was drilled in the eastern part of the Mero Field and it identified a thinner coquina layer In the basal section of this well silicified limestones interlayered with thin coquina prevail Also there are other carbonatic lithotypes s ilexite and undifferentiated igneous rocks The top of this unit is characterized by silicified carbonates interlayered with shales and igneous rocks absent of coquinas Conversely coquinas have not been identified in wells 3 BRSA1322 RJS and 3 BRSA 1345 RJS which were drilled respectively at the northern and southern parts of the Mero Field Figure 10 The top of the K38 sequence is characterized by an increase in gamma ray readings as demonstrated by the wells 2 ANP 2A RJS 3 BRSA 1255 RJS 3 B RSA 1342A RJS and 3 BRSA 1343 RJS On top of that in well 2 ANP 2A RJS there is also a drop in the resistivity sonic and density readings Figure 11 Overlying the K38 sequence occur the K44 K46 and K48 sequences of the Aptian Barra Velha Formation The last two sequences are difficult to distinguish and they will be treated together as a single K46 K48 sequence Grainstones composed of pelecypod shell fragments reworked from the underlying coquinas are described in the basal part of the K44 sequence The younger parts of this sequence as well as the K46 K48 sequence are composed mainly by the intercalation of centimetric to metric layers of spherulites stromatolites and laminites Terra et al 2010 Intercalation of grainstones composed of reworked fragments of spherulites and stromatolites is especially common in wells located on the distal western platform and is less common in other areas In wells drilled in the central eastern part of the Mero Field in addition to the lithotypes described earlier submetric intercalations of shales can be observed These carbonate high frequency cyclothems exhibit complex stratigraphic framework and each in situ facies may be deposited in different phases of fluctuations in the paleolake level in response to changes in the energy level Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2016 Saller et al 2016 as well to the paleolake geochemistry Wright and Barnett 2015 Farias et al 2019 Wright and Barnett 2020 In situ spherulites are common in the wells drilled at the apex of the Mero Field whereas on the western flank of the field they appear to occur only as reworked fragments or are not described at all in the wells located in distal positions In situ spherulites are uncommon in the southern and northern parts of the Mero Field In situ stromatolites including shrubs commonly subcentimeter are described in wells located in the distal western flank as well as in the northern part of the structure Laminites are characterized by compositional variation with intercalating submillimeter layers composed of nodules bioclasts and siliciclastic grains They are more common in the wells located in the western platform and in the basal section of the central platform wells but can also be observed in the southern and northern parts of the field It is interesting to note that these laminites are practically absent at the structural apex Seismic data analysis indicates variations in the occurrence of the K46 K48 sequence in the Mero Field In the central part of Mero Field the K46 K48 sequence ranges in thicknesses from 100 to 300 m It is characterized by continuous flat parallel reflectors low frequency and high negative amplitude and is interpreted as a carbonate platform

436 APPLICATION OF SEISMIC ARCHITECTURE INTERPRETATION IN PRE SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS INTRODUCTION The Santos Basin represents the largest pre salt exploration and production area in Brazil Currently it accounts for more than 70 of the country s oil and gas production ANP 2021 In this context the Buzios Field is considered a super giant field with an estimated volume in place of 3 058 million barrels of oil equivalent In January 2021 the outstanding result of 146 524 Bbl d was achieved by the platform with the highest oil production in the country In this Basin the main reservoirs are the inner coquinas a type of sedimentary rock composed mainly by shells and their fragments of the Itapema Formation and the spherulitic laminated deposits shrubs and reworked facies of the Barra Velha Formation Gomes et al 2020 The carbonate sedimentation processes are extremely sensitive to climatic factors hydrodynamics basin tectonics and morphology These differences might cause vertical and lateral heterogeneity effects in seismic facies Porta 2015 Castro 2019 showed that the Itapema Formation in the Buzios Field is less influenced by the presence of fine grain sediments and has better permeabilities than the Barra Velha Formation Both formations are important presalt exploration targets and have quite different sedimentary tectonic contexts The objective of this work is to understand the evolution of the rift and sag phases in the Buzios Field area from seismic data analysis Furthermore this paper intends to collaborate for a better understanding of the paleoenvironments and tectonic settings of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations Barremian Aptian succession of the Santos Basin Geological Setting The Santos Basin is located in the southeastern Brazilian margin bounded by the Campos Basin at the North and the Pelotas Basin at the South Santos Basin is one of the most extensive offshore Brazilian basins with an area of 352 000 km² and a current water depth of up to Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 3 000 m The main structural features are the Cabo Frio High to the Northeast and the Florianópolis Platform to the Southwest the Santos hinge line to the West which marks the external western limit of the salt Ariri Formation and the São Paulo plateau to the East Moreira et al 2007 The Buzios Field is located in the Santos Basin Fig 1 According to Moreira et al 2007 the geological history of the Santos Basin can be divided into three phases Rift Post rift and Drift The Rift phase displays extension efforts of separation between the South American and African plates which started from the Lower Cretaceous Muniz and Bosence 2015 describe that the sequence of tectonic events that caused the fragmentation of Gondwana would have started from the stretching and thinning process of the continental crust triggering a rifting process This fragmentation consisted of a mixed process controlled by lithospheric stretching and thermal anomalies The breakup of Gondwana occurred over a complex and heterogeneous basement composed of Paleoproterozoic Archaean age cratonic blocks and Neoproterozoic orogenic rocks Heilbron et al 2008 in addition to presenting a Paleozoic sedimentary coating covered by Eocretaceous volcanic rocks As stated by Moreira et al 2007 the crystalline basement of the Santos Basin generated in the context of Gondwana s amalgamation is characterized by granites and gneisses from Precambrian age of the Coastal Complex and metasediments of the Ribeira Belt Moreira et al 2007 During the main rifting process around 145 Ma the northwestern portion remained closed while a wedge was extended to the South along the east of South America Szatmari and Milani 2016 According to the authors volcanism would have been absent where the lithosphere was thick An important consequence during the rift phase was the space forming mechanism for sedimentary accommodation in an extensional tectonic setting and widespread normal fault generation due to the mechanical subsidence process causing reactivation of faults in the Precambrian basement Mohriak et al 2008

MACEDO ET AL 437 Figure 1 Location map of the Buzios Field Strugale et al 2021 point out that the different basement compositions represent another determining factor for the way the rifting process takes place Where the basement is heterogeneous the pre existing fabric was reactivated whenever its orientation was favorable producing faults as the extension direction rotates whereas low to very low angle basement fabric were cross cut by rift faults Where the basement was homogeneous and more stable only the previous formed faults remained active throughout the rifting Another effect observed was the contribution and influence of thermal anomalies in the region of the Santos Basin which would have been responsible for inducing the strain softening process since the beginning of the rift leading to the development of uplifted areas ANP LEBAC 2003 The importance of understanding the different processes related to the rifting phase relies on comprehending its influence during the deposition of the overlying sedimentary layers The rift super sequence is composed of continental siliciclastic talc stevensite ooids with interbedded lacustrine coquinas and organic rich shales of the Piçarras and Itapema formations consisting of essentially continental sediments Szatmari and Milani 2016 As opposed to what was proposed by Moreira et al 2007 Wright Barnett 2015 state that the lower part of the Barra Velha Formation belongs to the rift phase During the rift phase the sediments from the bottom of the Barra Velha Formation were deposited These deposits show a prominent wedge geometry which may represent differences in the fault movement rate that consequently created space for accommodation Buckley et al 2015 Thus they state that this may represent an increase in the sedimentation rate at the base of the Barra Velha Formation when compared to the Piçarras and Itapema formations The post rift sequence also known as the sag phase is represented by the Upper Barra Velha Formation which is characterized by shrubs spherulite laminated deposits and reworked facies Gomes et al 2020 precipitated in non marine carbonate successions Wright Barnett 2015 The absence of unambiguous palaeoecologically significant fossils together with the presence of the mineral stevensite rather than marine derived evaporates sulphates and chlorides indicates an alkaline lacustrine setting with a volcanic source area Wright Barnett 2015 In short the pre salt reservoir rocks are mainly in the Itapema and Barra Velha formations Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021

438 APPLICATION OF SEISMIC ARCHITECTURE INTERPRETATION IN PRE SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS The Itapema Formation is represented by grainstones to bivalves coquinas wackestones and bioclastic packstones carbonate shales and dark shales rich in organic matter which sometimes also work as source rocks The Barra Velha Formation is composed of carbonates deposited in a lacustrine environment with a multiplicity of facies from boundstones and grainstones to mudstones The Itapema Formation is limited at the bottom by the Jiquiá Buracica unconformity 126 4 M y and at the top by the Pré Alagoas unconformity while the Barra Velha Formation is limited at the bottom by the Pré Alagoas unconformity and at the top by the Base of Salt Moreira et al 2007 METHODOLOGY The seismic data provide information about the regional context depositional systems tectonic history and allow inferring geological features and heterogeneities favoring better understanding of sedimentary basins The interpretation of seismic reflection terminations onlap downlap toplap and erosive truncations is the main criteria for the recognition of stratigraphic units They are essential to better understand the resulting processes allowing foreseeing the current geological behavior Mitchum et al 1977 We performed the identification of seismic parameters to recognize information about the depositional environment source of sediments and the geological context in which the seismic facies were deposited In carbonate rocks due to the high heterogeneity of these rocks the integration of well and seismic data is essential for the reservoir characterization The steps used to develop this work are summarized in Figure 2 The seismic data used consist of a PSDM volume prestacked depth migration on which we apply a structural smoothing filter to remove part of migration smile noises The parameterization was a median filter with a vertical window 5mx5m not to lose the vertical Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 resolution and a lateral window of 7 5m x 7 5 x y Then we interpreted four important unconformities in the pre salt zone i Economic basement ii Jiquiá Buracica unconformity Piçarras and Itapema Formations iii Pré Alagoas unconformity top of coquina deposits and the boundary between Itapema and Lower Barra Velha Formations iv Intra Alagoas unconformity which separates the Lower Barra Velha from Upper Barra Velha and v the Base of the Salt Data from 15 wells Fig 3 helped in the seismic interpretation based on the identification of the boundaries between the lithostratigraphic units We selected well 9 BUZ 4 RJS through section BB to represent the identification of the main unconformities and formation boundaries and for analysis of depositional environment Fig 3 Previous works were also fundamental for a better understanding of the sedimentarytectonic history of the study area Castro 2019 Ferreira et al 2021a 2021b The seismic attribute TecVA Bulhões and Amorim 2005 was applied to highlight reflection events which is calculated from the absolute amplitude or RMS Fig 4 After calculating the absolute value of the trace RMS amplitude and its estimation of the seismic trace envelope the debias filter is applied and finally a phase rotation at 90º Hilbert transform RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The pre salt succession of the Santos Basin was described in this work based mainly on the i identification of seismic reflection terminations and the ii interpretation of regional unconformities and faults Figs 5 6 7 and 8 We recognize in Figure 5 the erosional truncations as reflectors that end on the base of the salt as a result of possible erosion especially in the region at the east of the F1 fault which caused a strong tilt in the strata We also visualized the amount of onlap markings present mainly in the region of a build up to the East Fig 6 It is noted that the

444 APPLICATION OF SEISMIC ARCHITECTURE INTERPRETATION IN PRE SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS We identified the following seismic patterns during interpretation 1 Carbonate build ups probably controlled by hydrothermal activity at the edge of faults 2 Carbonate platform sedimentation controlled by topography and bathymetry presenting aggradational or progradational character 3 Extensive carbonate platforms with planeparallel architecture present in the structural highs 4 Debris flow to the right of F3 Fig 6 correlated to the tectonics The carbonate mounds are often recognized presenting an internal low amplitude reflector behavior with great possibility to be an excellent reservoir Jesus et al 2019 Ferreira et al 2019 2021a The build ups display aggradational geometries that are onlapped and overlain by evaporates Figs 5 and 6 Above the Barra Velha Formation during the Neoaptian the evaporites of the Ariri Formation were deposited The base of the salt has a high amplitude characteristic and acts as the hydrocarbon seal at the region An isopach map provides information on a geological horizon and when combined with other geological information it can help the geologist interpret the tectonic activity and the history of this layer and its time segment The isopach map focuses on a special horizon and allows thickness analysis Based on the isopach maps Fig 9 we analyzed the thickness of each reservoir interval Itapema and Barra Velha strata to better understand their deposition phases over time which is characterized as an important step for future modeling To the Southeast we see a thickness increase of the Barra Velha Formation Fig 9A with probable mounds At this location the creation of accommodation space was very high Figure 9B displays a thickness increase at the central part of Itapema Formation at the same place where we observed a probable coquina bank restricted to the structural highs Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 between the main faults This configuration shows that the basic architecture and distribution of the shallow platforms and bottom lake areas remained similar with some differences during the deposition of these two lithostratigraphic units However the zones of high and low accommodation space vary with the tectonic context Fig 8 i heterogeneous in the Itapema Formation due to development of half graben structures and ii very homogeneous in the Barra Velha Formation due to the dominance of sag basin dynamics high accommodation regions controlled by rifting processes can be identified related to the lower Barra Velha sedimentation Szatmari and Milani 2016 also point out that there is an increase in the occurrence of oil reserves at the south of the Santos Basin According to the authors there is an increase of thickness to the South with the widening and deepening of the rift This pattern was also observed for the study area CONCLUSIONS Evidence of faults affecting the upper rift and sag sections in the location of the studied seismic sections indicates that the tectonic activity is at least locally controlling the sag phase sedimentation in some segments of the Buzios Field We identified seismic patterns as carbonate build ups probably controlled by hydrothermal activity at the edge of faults and carbonate platform sedimentation controlled by topography and bathymetry presenting aggradational or progradational character with plane parallel architecture in the structural highs Debris flows are correlated to the tectonics and there are platform slopes close to the main faults indicating the horst graben system The coquinas found towards the top of the Itapema Formation are associated with structural highs influenced by faults acting as depositional controllers The thickness of the Barra Velha Formation increases along the section due to the geological behavior and tectonic activity The thickness and geological structure of the Itapema Formation are more affected by the

D Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 88 2017 676e695 basins Lawrence et al 1990 In this paper we model the stacking pattern and sedimentary facies distribution of an Aptian lacustrine carbonate platform that composes the uppermost sedimentary succession of the sag stage in the Santos basin through tests and simulations of six parameters that act in the depositional process of carbonate rocks i initial lake paleobathymetry ii run time iii lake level oscillation curves iv values of subsidence rates extracted from the literature v carbonate depositional rates in mm y and vi different bathymetric intervals for carbonate deposition This study aims at the determination of a facies model to reproduce the sedimentary stacking pattern observed in well data and ﬁnally to propose a useful conceptual geological model for the deposition of the studied carbonate platform 2 Geological setting The Aptian carbonate platform focused on in this study is located in the central portion of the Santos basin approximately 310 km off the coast of the S ao Paulo state Fig 1 The origin and evolution of the basin are related to the breakup of the Gondwana Supercontinent but the Santos basin consists of a speciﬁc area that forms a kinematic buffer between the Austral and Central segments of the South Atlantic Ocean Moulin et al 2010 2012 Breakup initiated during the Early Cretaceous and culminated with the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean and implantation of the Brazilian marginal basins in the so called Brazilian Rift System Chang et al 1992 In a regional context of rift development from south to north along the southeastern and eastern continental margins the 677 Santos basin progressed from small grabens and lakes to a regional subsidence setting that created extensive sag phase lacustrine deposits Carminatti et al 2008 Quirk et al 2013 Thermal subsidence was then implemented by setting up a restricted environment with extensive deposition of evaporites during the Aptian At the beginning of the Albian a shallow carbonate platform was generated with the progression of the South Atlantic opening From the Middle Albian onwards the shallow carbonate platform was progressively drowned leading to the development of an open ocean setting in a passive margin tectonic environment Mio 2005 The stratigraphic sequence of the studied carbonate platform was deposited during the Neoaptian sag phase of the basin Fig 2 The depositional environment of this sequence was marked by a transitional setting between continental to shallow marine conditions Its upper limit is the base of the 113 My evaporites that mark the passage from a mixed clastic carbonate sedimentary sequence to an evaporitic environment Moreira et al 2007 There are no published and available models regarding the morphological conﬁguration of the sag lacustrine environments of the studied carbonate platform However Szatmari and Milani 2016 proposed a conﬁguration model for the lakes of the South Atlantic rift province that may be appropriate to the studied carbonate platform which developed during the sag phase of the Santos basin According to that model structural highs horsts would separate two distinct lakes which would eventually communicate as a result of the rising of lake levels due to combinations of low evaporation and high precipitation rates and become isolated again with the decrease in lake levels due to Fig 1 Location map of the study area The dashed gray polygon marks the limit of the pre salt ﬁeld s occurrence in the Santos and Campos basins The structural map base of salt of the platform where the study was developed based on the availability of 10 wells A to J and seismic grid is outlined in red The dashed blue lines are the nine seismic sections where structural restorations were performed For interpretation of the references to colour in this ﬁgure legend the reader is referred to the web version of this article

behavior of the lakes and carbonate deposition imposed by climatic conditions The proposed conﬁguration of the lakes would form an arrangement similar to the East African Rift System which remains the continental rift archetype and analogue widely used for the early stages of the evolution of passive continental margins prior to the opening of oceans Rosendahl et al 1986 In a rift system however the distance between lakes tends to decrease with the evolution of the rift the Aptian lakes of the Santos basin would be in a more advanced stage of development than the East African lakes which are still quite isolated from each other 2 1 Aptian carbonates of the Santos basin The studied Aptian carbonates of the Santos basin constitute a 100 m thick stratigraphic sequence that corresponds to part of the upper portion of the Barra Velha Formation Guaratiba Group whose sediments were deposited during the sag phase of the basin Fig 2 Concerning its formation environment the hypothesis that the Aptian carbonates of the Santos basin have a marine origin has been excluded due to the absence of marine fossils e g Wright and Barnett 2015 including typical marine environmental indicators such as miliolid foraminifera Ostracods are present but in forms that demonstrate a high salinity tolerance compatible with hypersaline environments such as those of lacustrine lakes Sulfate minerals such as gypsum and anhydrite are also absent equally suggesting that these carbonates are not of marine origin Wright and Barnett 2015 Based on well data four main sedimentary facies can be identiﬁed within the stratigraphic sequence of the carbonate platform according to Terra et al 2010 stromatolites STR grainstones GST laminites LMT and spherulitites SPH The main reservoir facies are stromatolites and grainstones Similar carbonates facies were also recognized at the regional scale of the South Atlantic Aptian lacustrine carbonates by Wright and Barnett 2015 under the form of i shrub type stromatolites ii laminites and iii spherulitites Shrubs are millimetric to centimetric in size composed of radial ﬁbrous calcite and occur as a single or branched structure aggregates of calcite are divergent and plumose fascicular optic calcite sensu Kendall 1977 Grotzinger and Knoll 1999 Shrubs occur in layers with predominantly vertical growth and are interbedded with thinner sediments giving a stratiﬁed appearance Lamellar units composed of shrubs can reach metric scale forming build ups Shrubs are also commonly fragmented and mixed with laminites and spherulitites forming reworked rocks grainstones to wackestones Laminites are composed of millimeter sheets of coalescing ﬁbrous calcite Spherulitites are symmetric spheres of ﬁbro radiated calcite Spherulites sensu Hodgson 1968 Schroeder 1972 Chafetz and Butler 1980 Verrecchia et al 1995 that commonly present diameters less than 2 mm Terra et al 2010 In some cases spherulitites occur in a matrix of magnesium clay and are oriented parallel to the bedding and replace and or displace the matrix According to Garcia Ruiz 2000 Beck and Andreassen 2010 and Meister et al 2011 spherulites grow in alkaline solutions rich in Mg and silica and are associated with the rapid growth of calcite crystals with or without microbial inﬂuence Wright and Barnett 2015 explain that intense evaporation would produce super saturated and alkaline waters being the trigger for the precipitation of magnesium silicate initially as a gel As the precipitation rates of this gel decrease or cease calcite crystals can develop and grow in the water column evidence of the presence of some traces of magnesium silicate remain however 679 2 2 Analogues for the lacustrine carbonates and discussion of the origin of the carbonate deposition For forward stratigraphic modeling purposes the following examples of world class lacustrine carbonate environments have been taken as analogues for the carbonate deposition of the Brazilian Aptian carbonate platform i Described carbonate facies of the Yacoraite Formation Balbuena Sequence in the Met an Alemania sub basin Salta basin Argentina Bento Freire 2012 Pedrinha 2014 are very similar to those observed in the Aptian carbonates in Santos As such they can be regarded as an analogue for the study of carbonate facies cyclicity in the Santos basin section 3 1 1 The Salta s carbonates correspond to a platform that evolved under a very rare marine inﬂuence Bento Freire 2012 Pedrinha 2014 This carbonate sequence is of microbial origin traceable over dozens of kilometers whose lateral facies variability is conditioned mainly to the accommodation space and local energy of the environment in which they were formed In the Salta basin the stromatolite laminite and grainstone facies are interpreted as carbonate depositions related to arid climate conditions The laminites are considered to have deposited in shallow water due to their small depositional thicknesses and recurrent associated subaerial exposure features The thicker stromatolite depositional units on the other hand are interpreted as carbonate facies developed at water levels relatively higher than those for the deposition of laminite facies The grainstones which were formed by the reworking of carbonate facies characterize sedimentary processes of high and moderate energy suggesting that their sedimentation occurred at positions where the lake was affected by currents and wave action Fine facies e g mudstones are also found in Salta basin and are interpreted as carbonate deposits that occurred in low energy portions of the lakes during humid climate conditions ii Lake Tanganyika in the East African Rift System is a wellstudied modern carbonate environment that can be used as a useful analogue to model the depths of occurrences of stromatolite facies in the Santos basin see sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 4 The stromatolites of Lake Tanganyika are of biotic origin and are under development in asymmetric half graben basins in which relationships between lake depth range and deposition of stromatolite facies are well established Casanova and Thouin 1990 Casanova and Hillaire Marcel 1992 Cohen et al 1997 Cohen et al 1997 have shown that stromatolites in this lake are mainly observed at depths ranging from 10 to 60 m below the actual lake level Due to Lake Tanganyika s level oscillations during the Holocene Cohen et al 1997 estimated the stromatolite original growth depth by the following approach 1 measuring the depth intervals where certain specimens appear to grow 2 examining fossils of gastropods which are associated with stromatolites with known depth ranges and 3 correlating stromatolite belts with old coastlines beachrock belts and sedimentary depth indicator structures According to the authors stromatolites would have grown at depths of up to approximately 30 m below lake level ii Saller et al 2016 described several Aptian carbonate facies in the Kwanza basin offshore of Angola that are similar to those observed in the carbonate platform of the Santos basin Kwanza has not been used in the present study as an analogue for modeling purposes However as there are only a few publications on the Aptian carbonate rocks of the Santos basin e g Wright and Barnett 2015 the Kwanza basin becomes an important example for understanding and discussing the origin of the carbonate facies in the Santos basin Lacustrine sedimentation in Kwanza has resulted in many unusual carbonate facies that raise questions about the origin of carbonate deposits are they biotic microbial Carminatti et al 2008 or abiotic Dorobek et al 2012 Wright and

680 D Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 88 2017 676e695 Barnett 2015 Saller et al 2016 on the one side argue that the stromatolite structures are positive structures similar to reefs and were formed by biotic reef organisms growing toward the light in addition dark organic laminations and erosional embayments support microbial inﬂuence On the other side Saller et al 2016 also consider that bundles of ﬁbrous calcite without organic laminations or embayments can be interpreted as abiotic It is worth mentioning that microbiological deposits and chemical abiotic deposits do not have mutually exclusive or even concurrent occurrences but are commonly associated Grotzinger and Knoll 1999 Riding 2008 In this sense Saller et al 2016 consider that the exact morphology of the calcite precipitation is due to the water energy of the lake the degree of supersaturation and the substrate with spherulites growing in muddy sediments and shrubs growing in shallow high energy highly supersaturated environments 3 Study area materials and methods The area selected for this study is a 9 km x 34 km rectangular area Fig 1 The available data set was provided by PETROBRAS Seismic data comprise a 3D seismic grid with a vertical resolution of circa 30 m and lateral resolution of circa 500 m The well data are composed of side samples 540 cores 227 m electric proﬁles and image logs from 10 wells Fig 1 In the present study three basic methodological steps were applied to construct the stratigraphic sedimentological forward models i a review of the carbonate descriptions made internally at PETROBRAS with the support of collaborators concerning the carbonate facies analysis from the available well data ii a 2D structural restoration of seismic sections to obtain the paleomorphology reliefs at the beginning and end of the depositional time interval and iii preliminary simulations to test and choose the main parameters to be used in the forward modeling 3 1 Data analyses The available data were analyzed to establish different geological aspects of the Aptian carbonate sequence of the Santos basin facies analysis and carbonate overall organization subsection 3 1 1 and structural interpretation and restoration of the carbonate stratigraphic sequence subsection 3 1 2 3 1 1 Carbonate description facies analysis and carbonate overall organization From the well data analysis four main facies were observed to occur in the studied carbonate platform laminites LMT grainstones GST stromatolites STR and spherulitites SPH The facies analyses from the wells also revealed that the carbonate overall organization from the base to the top is as follows Fig 3 i the presence of a thin layer of grainstone at the beginning of the stratigraphic sequence deposition ii the predominance of stromatolite facies at the lower 2 3 of the sedimentary succession with a small intercalation with spherulitites and iii the occurrence of an intercalation between laminite and grainstone facies at the upper 1 3 of the sedimentary succession Fig 4 shows the carbonate facies distribution per well along the studied platform For the pie chart only rock data cores and side samples were considered There is a signiﬁcant difference in the carbonate facies proportions in well E which was drilled in a relatively distal position of the platform where the predominance of the spherulitite facies is remarkable in comparison to the other wells drilled in the proximal higher portions of the carbonate platform Thus considering that the center of the lake which is located in the most central portion of the platform is shallower than its margins the facies proportion distribution along the platform Fig 4 and the facies characteristics it was possible to estimate the position of each facies in relation to the bathymetric ranges of their occurrences in the lake Bento Freire 2012 Pedrinha 2014 i Laminites occur at the top of the shallow hemicycle Fig 3 because they are characterized as shallow lake facies by the constant presence of exposure features and by the low accommodation spaces required for their deposition It was then estimated that laminites occur in the central part of the platform ii The stromatolites stratigraphic position in the lake is attributed to an increase in accommodation space especially on the edge of the platform An increase in accommodation space favors the vertical growth of bush forms Stromatolites therefore appear in the transitional zone between the shallow and deeper lake environments iii The grainstones are composed mainly of fragments The absence of matrix suggests they were formed in a high energy environment In the cyclicity study Fig 3 they represent the moment when the lake level began to rise and rework previously consolidated facies It was then estimated that grainstones occur in the central part of the platform with laminites iv Spherulitites are facies associated with a low energy environment due to their common association with magnesium clays They were therefore positioned on the top of the ﬂood hemicycle Fig 3 Together with mudstones facies they predominate in the platform deeper basin where a thicker water column is interpreted for lake deposition Mudstones were not observed in wells but it is estimated that they can occur in the lower portions of the platform 3 1 2 Structural interpretation and restoration The carbonate platform in this study area developed along a NESW structural high and is limited by normal faults F1 F2 and F3 with the same directions Fig 5A F1 has a dip opposite to those of F2 and F3 The carbonate stratigraphic section focused on in the present study is approximately 100 m thick its base is marked by the yellow reﬂector Fig 5A and the upper limit is represented by the base of the thick regional basin s salt layer orange reﬂector in Fig 5A The main faults intercept the studied seismic horizons and the salt base Seismic reﬂectors of the studied stratigraphic interval are characteristically sub parallel i e no progradation features were observed in the seismic data A total of nine 2D seismic sections Fig 1 were restored in the study area based on inclined shear techniques e g White et al 1986 six of the sections are dip oriented and the remaining three are strike oriented Fig 5 shows the results of the structural restoration applied to the section that crosses well C First the conﬁguration of main horizons to be restored was interpreted Fig 5 A Second the thick post salt section was decompacted Fig 5B The thick salt layer was then removed Fig 5C On this scale the deformation of the pre salt sequence by the salt is practically zero The faulted blocks were then restored Fig 5D that is they were put in their original positions before any structural movement Finally the top horizon of the model was adjusted to its original estimated position at the end of the deposition time Fig 5E Because this adjustment was manual it was important to maintain consistency between the seismic horizons in the sense that a restored section must be geologically reasonable The restored horizons Fig 5E in the nine sections were interpolated to create the surfaces serving as inputs for the simulations

interval which would be comparable to a carbonate platform under a greater inﬂuence of biotic microbial deposition Fig 4 Graphical representation on the restored structural map of the salt base of the carbonate facies proportion across the carbonate platform depths at which stromatolites are observed to occur in Lake Tanganyika Cohen et al 1997 The ﬁnal bathymetry was considered to equal zero indicating the lowest lake level marked by the thick salt layer deposition observed at the upper limit of the studied stratigraphic sequence It is worth noting however that during the simulations the maximum lake depth achieved depths as great as 100 m due to the constant subsidence and lake level oscillations 3 2 2 Depositional time interval As precise dating information from wells was not available for the pre salt carbonate deposition in the Santos basin two run times were tested in the numerical simulations based on the estimated duration for the deposition of the carbonate platform a short run time of 0 3 My from 113 3 My to 113 My and a longer run time of 2 4 My from 115 4 My to 113 My The times were estimated as follows It is known that the upper limit of the total sag phase sequence of the Santos basin is marked by the base of the evaporites 113 My in age Moreira et al 2007 whereas the lower limit is marked by the Intra Aptian Unconformity or DIA intra Alagoas Unconformity when considering PETROBRAS internal stratigraphic nomenclature of 117 My in age Moreira et al 2007 Thus the entire sag interval was deposited in 4 My Because we are only modeling the uppermost sag carbonate succession a run time of approximately half of the 4 My was estimated for testing a slow carbonate depositional environment 2 4 My Accordingly a value of circa 1 8 of the run time value equivalent to 0 3 My was used for testing a rapid carbonate depositional environment Using variable run times for the models was also important to determine the architecture of the carbonate platform either i during a shorter depositional interval which would be comparable 3 2 3 Lake level oscillation and subsidence rate Through identifying and locating the distribution of each facies in relation to lake bathymetry and based on the study of depositional cyclicity see section 3 1 1 above the cyclical ﬂuctuations of carbonate facies were interpreted as a result of lake level ﬂuctuations As an example a depth with the occurrence of a larger proportion of spherulitites facies as described from wells would reﬂect a humid environment based on the presence of clays and could thus be correlated to an increase in lake bathymetry Because no lake level oscillation curve was available in the literature the quantiﬁcation of the lake level oscillations was conceptual ranging from 0 to 100 m with the intent of creating sufﬁcient accommodation space to deposit the observed sediment thicknesses in the wells The lake level oscillation curves were adjusted during the calibration process Fig 7 to more precisely reproduce the overall facies organization observed in the wells and to test different climate scenarios In the simulations the accommodation space is governed by the combination of lake level oscillation and subsidence In the absence of known subsidence rates for the sag phase of the studied carbonate platform we considered the values of subsidence rates produced by regional scale back stripping subsidence models for the Santos basin published by Contreras et al 2010 According to those authors subsidence during the sag stage of the Santos basin 117 112 My was characterized by relatively constant subsidence rates of about 0 05 mm y across the entire basin Neither signiﬁcant depositional gradients nor differential tectonic and ﬂexuralinduced subsidence occur in this sag phase basin 3 2 4 Carbonate depositional rate For simulation purposes carbonate deposition is given as a function of time and depositional efﬁciency vs water depth Because there is no consensus regarding the carbonates origin for the studied platform the depositional rates were based on the ratios between the mean thickness of the carbonate section measured in the wells approximately 100 m and the considered run times 0 3 My and 2 4 My However the depositional rates had to be adjusted throughout the simulation tests in order to reproduce the sediment thicknesses observed in the well data For that goal the rate was equal to 0 6 mm y in Model 1 and 0 08 mm y in Models 2 3 and 4 The global distribution of carbonate facies is associated with a coefﬁcient of depositional efﬁciency according to lake bathymetry Thus the efﬁciency of facies deposition will depend on the bathymetry of the lake at each run time To establish such a relation for simulation purposes a non dimensional efﬁciency coefﬁcient ranging from 0 the facies will not settle to 1 the facies will settle with 100 efﬁciency was used to multiply the depositional rate per time to restrict the deposition of each facies within a bathymetric range Fig 8 Two relationships between carbonate facies deposition and related bathymetric depths were tested The ﬁrst test simulated the occurrence of grainstones and stromatolites as proximal facies deposited between 5 and 20 m deep and as an intermediate facies deposited between 15 and 60 m deep respectively Fig 8A The second test simulated different depths and positions for the occurrences of grainstones and stromatolites facies along the depositional proﬁle therefore both facies were considered to occur as more proximal facies the deposition of grainstones at depths of 1e10 m and the deposition of stromatolites from depths of

facies Fig 8A and B according to the facies analysis presented in section 3 1 1 In that context the hypothesis of shallow bathymetry values for grainstones and stromatolites occurrence presents a straightforward correlation with the depths at which Tanganyika stromatolites are estimated to have been deposited Cohen et al 1997 For modeling purposes an inﬂux of clastic sediments into the studied platform was considered to be absent In addition the simulated facies were considered to be representative of the primary depositional conditions and as a consequence diagenetic factors were not considered 4 Results of the stratigraphic sedimentological forward modeling The main parameters tested as input data for the simulation of the stratigraphic sedimentological forward modeling and that were capable of affecting the Aptian carbonate stacking pattern and facies distribution observed in the available well data were i the carbonate depositional rate in mm y ii the bathymetric intervals for carbonate facies occurrences iii initial paleobathymetry iv lake level oscillation curves and v values of subsidence rates extracted from the literature After setting the main modeling parameters to be considered four stratigraphic sedimentological simulations Models 1 to 4 among many others undertaken are presented below they represent those models whose given initial conditions and parameter values resulted in potential predictive responses capable of explaining one or more environmental conditions involved in the deposition of the studied carbonate platform It is also noteworthy that a all the models were simulated considering the same initial lake bathymetry 60 m deep b the considered time step of the simulations was 0 01 My for Model 1 30 time steps from 113 3 to 113 My and 0 05 My for Models 2 to 4 48 time steps from 115 4 to 113 My and c throughout the simulations various modeling parameters such as lake level oscillation curves and carbonate depositional rates also had to be modiﬁed to reproduce the facies stacking pattern observed in the wells Table 1 summarizes the values of all the changing parameters used in each model 4 1 Model 1 Stratigraphic sedimentological Models 1 to 3 simulated grainstones and stromatolites facies as occurring as a proximal facies from 5 to 20 m deep and an intermediate facies from 15 to 60 m deep respectively Fig 8A In Model 1 the initial carbonate depositional rate was 0 3 mm y which was obtained by the relation between the average sediment thickness observed in the wells 100 m and the considered run time of 0 3 My However the depositional rate was insufﬁcient to reproduce the sediment thicknesses observed in all of the wells For that reason the carbonate depositional rate was progressively increased to 0 6 mm y which was the optimum value for the resulting simulated thickness Fig 9 This last run of Model 1 was satisfactory from the perspective of the simulated facies proportions when compared with the stacking pattern observed in the well data Fig 10 1 the presence of a thin layer of grainstone located at the base of the stratigraphic sequence 2 the predominance of stromatolite facies at the lower 2 3 of the sedimentary succession with an intercalation with spherulitites and 3 the occurrence of intercalations of laminite with grainstone at the top of the wells The simulated distribution of the facies proportions across the carbonate platform is shown in Fig 11 Laminite and grainstone Fig 6 Paleomorphological maps obtained from the structural restoration of 2D seismic lines the top morphology A and base morphology B of the model The initial bathymetry map C was generated by normalizing the base model map from 0 to 60 m facies were deposited in the shallower central portion of the platform Stromatolite facies spread out almost throughout the carbonaceous platform A spherulitite facies was deposited in the deeper and lower energy portions of the platform with occasional mudstone occurrences 4 2 Model 2 Model 2 considered the same parameters as Model 1 Table 1 with the exception of the time for carbonate deposition for which a longer run time of 2 4 My was used which corresponds to an increase of 8X in the run time for carbonate deposition in relation to that of Model 1 It produced an approximately 8 times decrease in the carbonate depositional rate in relation to that of Model 1 The carbonate depositional rate was 0 6 mm y in Model 1 and 0 08 mm y in Model 2 It is worth noting that although Curve 1 in Model 1 and Curve 2 in Model 2 describing lake level oscillations are the same they cover however different time spans Curve 1 describes lake level oscillations from 113 3 to 113 My whereas Curve 2 describes lake level oscillations from 115 4 to 113 My Fig 7 However the response of Model 2 in reproducing the carbonate stacking pattern and lateral facies distribution was not satisfactory when compared to the well data The generated accommodation space was exaggerated because subsidence takes place over a larger time span thus creating larger accommodation space Therefore laminite and grainstone facies did not develop Fig 12 In addition there was an over thickened ﬁnal deposition of stromatolite facies in certain portions of the carbonate platform which generated an anomalous carbonate platform geometry Fig 12 4 3 Model 3 In Model 3 we used the same carbonate depositional rate of 0 08 mm y and 2 4 My run time as those of Model 2 Table 1 However a gently decreasing lake level oscillation curve Curve 3 was applied to the model The trend of decreasing lake bathymetry towards the top of the model Fig 7B was used in order to decrease the accommodation space generated in Model 2 and to generate more evaporitic environmental conditions in comparison to those of Models 1 and 2 The results obtained from Model 3 show similarities with the occurrence of the facies in the well data Fig 13 and the overall carbonate thickness across the entire platform In a few simulated wells the carbonate thickness was exceeded well C in Fig 13 wells B and E in Fig 9 From the distribution of the carbonate facies

grainstone STR ¼ stromatolite SPH ¼ spherulitite MUD ¼ mudstone HBD ¼ hybrid facies opportunity to test a variety of unknown depositional parameters in order to put forward possible depositional scenarios for the carbonate platform It is worth mentioning however that due to a question of differences in the resolution levels of the well data and simulations layers time steps and simpliﬁed depositional laws stratigraphic sedimentological forward modeling can very rarely replicate in detail both the proportions and frequencies of facies occurrences seen in actual well data The original and exact sediment thickness of a layer will hardly be exactly reproduced the same way as observed in all wells and one or another well will therefore inevitably not be fully respected Nonetheless in the present study a fair reproduction of facies distribution and overall organization as shown in well data was successfully achieved through the modeling However it was observed that by increasing the time steps did not result in signiﬁcant increase of detailing From the integration of all the results we were able to analyze all the models in terms of the resulting stacking pattern and lateral facies distribution Although important for an overall approach to the role of depositional parameters in the simulation results Models 1 2 and 4 were dismissed when regarding the proposition of a conceptual model We could thus indicate Model 3 and the related set of model base depositional parameters which best replicated the carbonate platform as indicated from the seismic data structural restoration and facies analyses 691 5 3 2 Tentative models 1 2 and 4 Although Model 1 was able to reproduce the carbonate overall organization as observed in the well data it could not replicate the sediment thicknesses measured on the wells sections see simulated well A of Model 1 in Fig 9 In addition it produced the very same proportion of stromatolites across the entire carbonate platform which was approximately 30 Fig 11 and was thus not in accordance with the well facies data analyses In Model 2 the carbonate overall organization and lateral facies distribution obtained from the simulations were not satisfactory when compared to the well data Fig 12 An excess of accommodation space was generated and as a consequence laminite and grainstone facies could not develop Model 4 considered that stromatolite growth was limited to a maximum lake depth of 30 m Fig 8B However the use of Curve 4 Fig 7B which imposed a strong tendency of decreasing the lake bathymetry resulted in a more restricted accommodation space in comparison to that of Model 3 Figs 13 and 16 In addition grainstone facies tended to dominate the upper portion of the simulated well sections Fig 17 which is not in accordance with the very dry lake conditions expected to have occurred at the end of the carbonate depositional cycle In addition the spread of the spherulitite facies across the entire platform generated a thick layer of such facies Fig 16 in the model which is not observed in well sections In fact an extensive layer of spherulitite facies would be expected in the case of the occurrence of a regional ﬂooding phase of lakes in fact the low amplitude peak in the seismic data just above the horizon interpreted as the base for the carbonate succession in seismic data Fig 5A has been interpreted in this study as a presumed spherulite facies anomaly In terms of hydrocarbon industry production a thick layer of spherulitite may represent a permeability barrier to the communication between reservoir facies due to the low permo porous quality typical of spherulitite rich in magnesium clay unless those spherulitite undergo some diagenetic alteration such as dissolution However the conﬁrmation of a presumed lake ﬂooding marker would have to be veriﬁed across nearby portions of carbonate platforms in other wells This permeability barrier can also be validated by comparing facies model data with the production data responses 5 3 3 Model 3 e a conceptual model proposed to explain the development of the Aptian carbonate platform Model 3 replicated the overall organization observed in the wells and reached the sediment thickness across the entire simulated carbonate platform In some wells the thickness of the ﬁnal simulated well section was larger than those observed in the drilled wells Figs 9 and 13 The thicker depositional succession is the result of the generation of a larger accommodation due to a longerterm subsidence acting in Model 3 in comparison to that in Model 1 Nevertheless Model 3 is considered to produce the best ﬁt to explain the development of the Aptian carbonate platform because only that model produced the carbonate sediment thicknesses observed in the stratigraphic wells across the entire platform even if the simulated sediment thicknesses exceeded the observed values in some wells Figs 9 and 13 The simulated over thickened deposition of carbonates may be geologically justiﬁed if we consider subsequent erosion and or compaction or even changes in depositional rates due to environmental variations which would lead to decreases in the original carbonate depositional thicknesses It is also worth noting that an arid climate was previously proposed to have prevailed during the rifting of the Santos basin at the end of the carbonate deposition e g Petri 1987 Brownﬁeld and Charpentier 2006 Chaboureau et al 2012 as indicated by the presence of the thick overlying salt layers that point to growing

Rifted margins Syn rift sequence hierarchy Sequence stratigraphy This paper uses high resolution 2D and 3D seismic surveys tied to stratigraphic data from 155 boreholes in the mapping and hierarchization of 1551 extensional faults across the Santos Basin and its Outer High These faults were able to control deposition in extensional basins with different ages they are thus classified into three 3 main systems with the aim of understanding their geodynamic significance Fault system 1 FS1 controlled the oldest syn rift sequence and delimits the very first half graben basins developed during an Early Rift stage Fault System 2 FS2 was formed in response to crustal thinning during an Intermediate rifting stage Fault System 3 FS3 responded to the migration of the rift axis towards the distal margin in a Late Rift stage Strikingly fault reactivation occurred throughout the entirety of the proximal domain of the Santos Basin during the Late Rift Stage This work is important as each interpreted fault system is understood to have controlled the availability of accommodation space during its peak activity thereby shaping the inner proximal outer proximal and distal domains of the Santos Basin The evolution of these fault systems also resulted in the deposition of syn rift se quences that obey a specific order or ranking By correlating fault systems with their adjacent syn rift strata we propose 1st order sequence boundaries that are associated with each stage of the development of the Santos Basin formed as a consequence of changes in thermo mechanical conditions during the evolution of rifted margins Identified 2nd order sequences are attributed to tectonic movements at the crustal block scale In contrast stratigraphic sequences of the 3rd and 4th orders are associated with localised tectonic inputs Within this framework we use stratigraphic surfaces as structural markers across multiple observational scales Consequently sequence 1SEQ1 corresponds to the stretching phase standing for the initial stages of rifting within an intraplate setting Sequence 1SEQ2 relates to the necking stage and formation of the outer proximal domain whereas sequence 1SEQ3 accompanied the development of the distal domain in the so called hyper extension and continental breakup stages Ultimately this work demonstrates that the tectono stratigraphic

P R O Andrade et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 177 2025 107384 diachronic tectono stratigraphic record Such a record varies along and across hierarchized fault systems that are developed at multiple scales of observation 1 Introduction 2 Data and methods Reconstructing the geometry genesis and evolution of syn rift ba sins is key to understanding how continental margins are formed and progress towards their continental breakup stage Lovecchio et al 2024 Yet gaps in the stratigraphic record are still common in sedi mentary basins that record multiphase extensional episodes such as SE Brazil s This is due to the combined effects of vertical tectonic move ments interactions amongst local scale structures such as fault linkage points and step overs and geodynamic processes acting on the larger continental margin scale Gresseth et al 2023 Osmundsen and Pe ron Pinvidic 2018 Redfield and Osmundsen 2013 Moreover syn rift tectonics can persist after continental breakup is achieved including in deep offshore basins of SE Brazil where it supposedly led to the reactivation of pre existent extensional structures at different times and with varying magnitudes Alves et al 2023 Lei et al 2019 Soares et al 2012 All these aspects stress the fact that a continental margin s architecture impacts its reservoir successions and consequently the compartmentalization and fluid migration in these same reservoirs regardless if one is considering oil and gas extraction carbon storage or geoenergy solutions Brackenridge et al 2023 Fisher et al 2023 Jackson et al 2024 Konstantinovskaya et al 2023 Siler 2023 Ven tisky and Gilfillan 2023 A vast suite of seismic and borehole data acquired across the Santos Basin and its Outer High offshore SE Brazil is used in this work to investigate the relationship between tectonic structures and their sedi mentary record Fig 1 Comprising some of the largest Pre salt hy drocarbon fields in SE Brazil e g Tupi Búzios Mero Atapu and Berbiga o Sururu the Outer High is crucial to characterize the spatio temporal evolution of rifted continental margins as it was the locus of new 3D seismic and drilling campaigns in the 2020s Through the detailed analysis of a comprehensive seismic and borehole dataset this works addresses the following research questions 2 1 Seismic and borehole data The seismic data in this work comprise a suite of 3D volumes and regional 2D profiles Figs 1 and 2 Three dimensional 3D volumes include the depth converted 0262 Alto Cabo Frio 0302 Tambau Uru gua Tambuata R0264 Santos 6a libra R0282 Santos Cluster and R0302 Franco Fig 2b These seismic data are complemented by stratigraphic and wireline data from 155 exploration and production wells some of which are shown in Fig 2c A total of nine 9 seismic horizons and 1551 faults are interpreted in the study area Regional ION GXT seismic profiles 2D are used to fit the more local interpretation of 3D seismic data into a broader margin wide scale of observation The ION GXT seismic data acquired by the Bra silSpan Project consist of pre stack depth profiles migrated using the Kirchoff algorithm Kumar et al 2013 All seismic and borehole data were provided by ANP Brazil s National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels Fig 2 2 2 Data interpretation workflow 2 2 1 Structural interpretation Fault systems were identified in this work based on the recognition and mapping of their structural styles geometries magnitudes of displacement orientations the superposition of deformation and kine matic relations and relative ages Their temporal relationships with respect to the sedimentary infill of adjacent syn rift basins were addressed by mapping how each fault system controlled the growth and thinning of strata within specific seismic stratigraphic sequences Hence the main criterion used to separate fault systems was the relative age of growth strata in discrete basins and sub basins the faults were responsible for Fig 3 This included the recognition of a fault displacement and cross cutting geometries and b stratigraphic se quences truncated by both local and regional unconformities The original geometries of faults and syn rift strata when deformed by tec tonic movements were useful in interpreting their relative ages and kinematic histories e g Haupert et al 2016 Nemc ok 2015 Osmund sen and Pe ron Pinvidic 2018 Peacock et al 2000 1 What is the role of rifted margins architecture and associated fault systems in the depositional and stacking histories of syn rift sequences 2 How do the dimensions and relative timings of fault systems relate to the syn rift stratigraphic record of the Santos Basin 3 How have stratigraphic sequences responded to the geodynamic evolution of the Santos Basin in the context of SE Brazil s rifting and continental breakup 2 2 2 Seismic stratigraphic interpretation To delimit and hierarchize stratigraphic sequences we combined the sequence stratigraphic principles in Catuneanu 2022 2019a 2019b Catuneanu et al 2011 2010 Fragoso et al 2022 2021 Magalha es et al 2021 2020 with the structural geology concepts regarding the superposition of deformation and kinematic relations with the concepts of structural geology that underpin structural analysis e g Birrell and Courtier 1999 Delvaux et al 1997 Fournier and Petit 2007 Lisle 1992 2004 Lisle and Leyshon 2004 Marrett and Allmendinger 1990 Petit 1987 Price and Cosgrove 1990 Rowland et al 2007 The aim was to establish a genetic relationship whereby the stratigraphic record responds to tectonic stimuli On rifting continental margins the stratigraphic record at the largest scale is hierarchically classified as being of the 1st order According to Catuneanu 2022 2019b and Catuneanu et al 2011 2010 a 1st order sequence must represent relatively conformable successions in the sense that internal unconformities do not disrupt its tectonic significance nor the continuity of a basin s palaeogeographic evolution In the case of sedimentary basins recording multiple tectonic events the limits of 1st order sequences denote changes in basin type and are the most sig nificant within a sedimentary succession regardless of the time interval This paper characterizes and hierarchizes the stratigraphic sequences and related fault systems that make up the Santos Basin near its Outer High offshore SE Brazil Fig 1 It addresses the spatial and temporal evolution of faults and strata from a geodynamic point of view by considering 1st to 4th order stratigraphic sequences as having responded to syn rift tectonics imposed at different scales of observation We therefore propose a novel temporal and spatial classification for faults developed on rifted continental margins This new classification high lights the role of each fault system in controlling syn rift topography and sediment accommodation space across different scales of observation The main advantage of such a workflow is that it allows one to change between scales of observation while maintaining similar structural stratigraphic criteria and references 2

P R O Andrade et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 177 2025 107384 recorded between two consecutive events Fig 4 Thus an internal hierarchization of the larger depositional sequences in our study area was completed after we set up the 1st order limits of syn rift strata Later any observed relationships between tectonic stimuli and stratigraphic responses to such stimuli were explained at different scales resulting in the identification of specific fault systems Fig 4 Such a method allowed us to change between different scales of observation during our tectono stratigraphic interpretation Setting up a low resolution stratigraphic framework at the 1st order scale enabled a better positioning of the boundaries of higher resolution 2nd 3rd and 4th order sequences within our seismic stratigraphic framework Additionally this same sequence stratigraphic framework allowed us to coherently change our observations across multiple scales Catuneanu 2019a 2019b 2022 Fragoso et al 2021 2022 Magalha es et al 2020 2021 as the higher ranked sequences 1st order modulate the lower ranked sequences i e those with a higher 2nd to 4th order frequency By following such an approach we investigated each domain of the rifted margin of the Santos Basin as the final expression of Fig 2 Regional map showing the location of a the interpreted 2D and 3D seismic data and b the 155 exploration boreholes tied to the seismic data in this work The study area is highlighted by a grey polygon The position of arbitrary lines and wells is shown in the inset c 4

P R O Andrade et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 177 2025 107384 distinct tectonic contexts and events These events relate to the past thermo mechanical conditions of the Santos Basin which were disparate enough to generate contrasting 1st order sequences similarly to what was proposed in Chenin et al 2022 In comparison 2nd order se quences responded to tectonic movements at an intermediate scale be tween continental and the local scale Local interactions amongst fault systems and stratigraphic sequences are known to be dynamic resulting in complex syn rift architectures and the development of 3rd to 4th or der stratigraphic sequences Alvarenga et al 2021 Holz et al 2017 Martins Neto and Catuneanu 2010 Wescott et al 1996 In this work we restrict the scope of the terms syn tectonic and posttectonic to the local scale Similarly the terms wedge shaped and sag do not carry a genetic connotation tied to stages of active tectonism and thermal subsidence as proposed in McKenzie 1978 they simply represent the external geometries of the depocentres in which strata were accommodated Due to the inherent complexity of the Santos Basin we subsequently chose to describe its structural framework in terms of fault systems rather than focusing on specific fault segments as explained in the following sections study area and b the Outer High of the Santos Basin located in a central position relative to the Sa o Paulo Plateau Fig 1b and c The Cabo Frio High contains a suite of igneous rocks spanning three 3 magmatic events 1 a first event within the Camboriú Formation 2 a second event recorded by the intrusion of Campanian Turonian basalts though poorly represented throughout the Santos Basin and 3 a third episode recording the emplacement of Upper Paleocene Eocene diabases and extrusive volcaniclastics Mizusaki et al 1992 Mizusaki and Thomaz Filho 2004 In comparison the Outer High is elongated in a NE SW direction and shows relatively thin sediments oceanwards when compared to the proximal domain of the Santos Basin Gomes et al 2012 Due to their specific gravimetric and magnetic signatures basement terrains outcropping along the coast of SE Brazil have been previously considered to extend beneath the Santos Basin Dehler et al 2016 Gordon et al 2023 Graça et al 2019 Stanton et al 2010 2019 Hence the NE SW strike of these basement terrains likely influenced the location and geometry of normal faults in offshore syn rift basins In fact the study area is underlain by the Ribeira Belt composed of amalgamated Precambrian terrains that are interspersed with NE SW anastomosing shear zones and magmatic intrusions Heilbron et al 2000 2017 Schmitt et al 2016 2018 2023 This basement control on syn rift structures was recorded from the onset of intraplate rifting up to its final rifted margin configuration which in the Santos Basin was established at the start of the Albian Araújo et al 2023 Karner 2000 Schmitt et al 2023 3 Geological background 3 1 Physiography of the Santos basin and underlying basement terrains The Santos Basin is delimited to the north by the Cabo Frio High in its proximal sector and by the Jean Charcot seamounts in its distal sector To the south its limit is given by the Floriano polis High Fig 1 The central part of the basin is characterized by its significant magnetic and gravimetric anomalies e g Galva o and de Castro 2017 Graça et al 2019 Xu et al 2024 Yin et al 2024 which are separated by a transfer zone that is parallel to the eastern limit of the basin Fig 1a and b Two key physiographic features should be highlighted due to their proximity to the study area a the Cabo Frio High to the north of the 3 2 Stratigraphy of the Santos basin The syn rift stratigraphy of the Santos Basin gained new importance after the discovery of giant pre salt fields offshore Brazil in the early 2000s Fig 2 Initially Moreira et al 2007 considered a tectono sedimentary evolution for the basin that comprises three Fig 3 Relative chronology amongst fault systems in the Santos Basin a Schematic fault chronology Depocentres are diachronous but offset by the youngest black fault occurring in phase 3 In a i black fault offsets the oldest blue fault formed in phase 1 which is also offset by the red fault formed in phase 2 In a ii the fault generated in phase 3 offsets the fault formed in phase 2 b Schematic fault classification in this work with Fault System 2 used as an example Synchronous faults formed during the same tectonic event distribute deformation in the basin in such a way that primary faults accumulate most of deformation and limit secondary and small scale faults 5

According to our interpretation the 1st order sequence 1SEQ3 coincides with the Late Rift phase of Adriano et al 2022 but the limits of the sequences 1SEQ2 and 1 SEQ1 are slightly different from those proposed by the latter authors Instead we propose a pre rift interval that correlates with the Camboriú formation of Moreira et al 2007 to position sequence 1SEQ1 between 130 Ma Rift Onset and 123 Ma i e encompassing the Piçarras and Itapema formations in Moreira et al 2007 more detailed description of the supra salt succession can be found in Modica and Brush 2004 Some authors favour a different interpretation for the stratigraphic position and significance of the top of the Rift sequence For example Buckley et al 2015 Barnett et al 2021a b and Minzoni et al 2021 suggest that the lower part of the Barra Velha Formation Fig 5 reflects the syn rift stage and is followed by a phase of passive subsidence encompassing the upper Barra Velha and Ariri Formations Conversely authors like Karner and Gambo a 2007 Torsvik et al 2009 and Moulin et al 2013 propose that the syn rift stage extends into the evaporitic Ariri Formation thus also including the lower Barra Velha Formation in this syn rift episode Fig 5 Alves et al 2020 considered this last phase of passive subsidence on the proximal margin as clearly tectonically driven on the distal margin thus reflecting progressive S N continental breakup in SE Brazil all part of a breakup stratigraphic sequence Finally seismic stratigraphic interpretations in Adriano et al 2022 to propose a syn rift context divided into three phases Early Rift Upper Rift and Late Rift as illustrated in Fig 5 For the sake of simplicity the stratigraphic interval of interest in this work ranges be tween 135 Ma and 110 Ma in age We numbered the 1st order sequences in Adriano et al 2022 propose a syn rift context divided into three phases Early Rift Upper Rift and Late Rift as illustrated in Fig 5 For the sake of simplicity the stratigraphic interval of interest in this work ranges between 135 Ma and 110 Ma Fig 5 We numbered the 1st order sequences in Adriano et al 2022 in a different way 1SEQ1 to 1SEQ3 and sub divided their Early Rift sequence in Pre rift and 1SEQ1 Fig 5 The Santos Basin witnessed several magmatic cycles from Val anginian times to the Eocene yet revealing a wide ranging distribution of igneous rocks in its interior Gordon et al 2023 undertook a review of magmatic cycles in the basin relative to the geodynamic processes that occurred during the evolution of the SE Brazil The first magmatic cycle occurred between c 135 Ma and 132 130 Ma during the rift onset stage and is documented by a coastal dike swarm and associated alka line provinces Ferreira et al 2023 The second cycle includes syn rift 132 130 to 123 Ma and post rift 123 113 112 Ma magmatic rocks The third cycle comprises drift or post continental breakup magmatic rocks that are Lower Cretaceous to Lower Cenozoic in age 110 40 Ma According to Geraldes et al 2013 and Gordon et al 2023 magmatism during the drift stage appears to have been still controlled by tectonics as magmatic bodies are preferentially aligned with crustal discontinuity lines All magmatic cycles rift onset syn post rift and drift show variations in magmatic volume the morphology of igneous edifices and their locations when moving from the south to the cen tre north of the Santos Basin 3 3 Geodynamic framework The geodynamic evolution of SE Brazil during the Early Cretaceous has been explained by the hyperextended margin model of authors such as Blaich et al 2011 Karner 2000 Karner and Driscoll 1999 Pe ron Pinvidic et al 2017 and Zala n et al 2011 Seismic reflection and gravity inversion data led some authors to interpret the Santos Basin as part of a hyperextended magma poor continental margin in which the upper crust behaved rigidly while the lower crust experienced stretching and the formation of irregular necking zones at its base Dehler et al 2016 Graça et al 2019 Stanton et al 2010 2019 Yin et al 2024 According to such models the lower crust adopted a boudin like geometry before mantle exhumation ensued Blaich et al 2011 Pe ron Pinvidic et al 2017 Zala n et al 2011 However seismic refraction data in Evain et al 2015 have excluded the presence of exhumed mantle in the Santos Basin leading to its subdivision in four distinct zones or domains 1 inner proximal margin 2 outer prox imal margin 3 distal margin and 4 oceanic domain see Araújo et al 2023 These domains are marked by significant changes in crustal thickness which are themselves accompanied by changes in syn rift structural style similar to those described for the NW Iberian and Adria margins Manatschal and Bernoulli 1999 Near the Santos Outer High crustal extension in the initial phases of continental rifting was characterized by the existence of a 10 15 km thick crust populated by rotated blocks bounded by oceanward dipping faults most of which soled out in the lower crust Blaich et al 2011 Gomes et al 2012 Pe ron Pinvidic et al 2017 Zala n et al 2011 This crustal arrangement responded to the lateral migration of the rift axis towards the Benguela African side under particular rheological conditions i e the lower crust was weak enough to allow lateral rift migration but too strong for massive flow Araújo et al 2023 7

internal re flections and strata onlapping against the margins of sag shaped depocentres Fig 7 In contrast near the oceanward edge of the outer proximal domain 1SEQ2 fills half graben basins that were formed above rotating crustal blocks delimited by large normal faults Figs 7 and 8 The change in depocentre geometry from well developed half grabens to sag like sub basins recorded as a 1st order stratigraphic surface that can be mapped throughout the study area marks the boundary between 1SEQ1 and 1SEQ2 Figs 7 and 8a Against this backdrop the Outer High of the Santos Basin is interpreted to represent a piece of the upper crust detached from the inner proximal domain and offset by normal faults that delimit internal rotated crustal blocks The youngest 1st order sequence 1SEQ3 correlates with the Late Rift stage of Adriano et al 2022 and was deposited during the last stages of extension as the axis of rifting migrated oceanwards It reveals a sag type geometry in the proximal domain of the basin but is clearly synchronous with syn tectonic growth strata in the distal domain Figs 7 and 8d As a result the boundary between 1SEQ2 and 1SEQ3 is marked by a low angle unconformity in the proximal domain but com prises a prominent angular unconformity in the distal domain Figs 7 and 8 The original position and internal geometry of 1SEQ3 have been modified by halokinesis in the distal domain of the Santos Basin Alves et al 2017 However in some distal depocentres the fraction of salt that remained immobile may sometimes retain a sag type geometry Fig 8d Therefore we consider that the top of 1SEQ3 correlates with the top of the original salt unit at the time of its deposition This event marks the end of the rifting process as suggested by Karner and Gambo a 2007 Torsvik et al 2009 Moulin et al 2013 and Adriano et al 2022 4 1 Pre rift sequence The expression of the structural paleo relief unrestored at the top of the pre rift sequence records the 1st order stratigraphic surface that marks the beginning of syn rift extension Fig 6a Although the pre rift sequence was interpreted as being of the 1st order Fig 7 e Fig 8c the increase in stratigraphic resolution resulting from the high quality 3D data interpreted in this work allowed for a better characterization of the pre rift sequence towards the 2nd order scale for the whole of the Santos Basin Fig 9 The pre rift sequence shows sub parallel internal seismic reflections that likely span from the Valanginian c 135 Ma to the early Hau terivian 130 Ma in age The pre rift sequence is also isopachous especially near the Búzios field while being unconformable over the Precambrian basement Fig 9a and b The sequence is detected in the seismic volumes shot over the Búzios and Tupi fields as well as in some of the depocentres surrounding the latter but rarely over the Mero field Fig 11a and b Our interpretation thus favours an onset of continental rifting during the early Hauterivian 130 Ma i e after the deposition of the pre rift sequence which is essentially a pre tectonic interval in the Santos Basin Despite its pre tectonic character expressed by its sub parallel and isopachous internal reflections several authors consider the correlative Camboriú Formation as part of the Rift stage e g Adriano et al 2022 Barnett et al 2021a b Buckley et al 2015 Karner and Gambo a 2007 Minzoni et al 2021 Moulin et al 2013 Torsvik et al 2009 However considering it as a syn rift interval causes important contradictions in geodynamic terms If one considers the Camboriú Formation as the offshore expression of the Serra Geral magmatism or ultimately a by product of the Trista o da Cunha plume Lovecchio et al 2024 one must interpret it as a syn rift interval To do so one must consider that the extrusion of lava in the Serra Geral Formation occurred in response to adiabatic decompression at the start of continental rifting shortly after the generalized phase of thermal uplift that accompanied the intrusion of a mantle plume In this work we chose to strictly adhere to the seismic expression of the Camboriú Formation within the sequence hierarchical criteria of Catuneanu 2022 Catuneanu et al 2011 2010 and thus interpret it as a pre rift sequence sensu Prosser 1993 4 3 2nd order sequences A structural palaeo relief map of three main surfaces bounding 2ndorder sequences where their boundaries also coincide with the boundaries of 1st order sequences is shown in Fig 6 The sigmoidal geometry of fault systems the degree of continuity of faults plus the spatial arrangement and different ages of stratigraphic sequences in Fig 6 reveal how useful 2nd order sequences are as structural markers On seismic profiles 2nd order sequences fill depocentres that were formed during the relative motion of crustal blocks Fig 9 Thus se quences 2SEQ1 to 2SEQ2 were preserved just above pre rift strata and angular truncations mark the contact between the two latter sequences and pre rift strata yellow arrows in Figs 10 and 11 Posing this sequence 2SEQ1 fills sets of asymmetric half grabens with growth strata in their interior It generally fills rotated depocentres that were eroded and truncated on top by a well marked angular unconformity created by 2SEQ2 Importantly sequence 2SEQ1 is not observed oceanwards from the Mero Búzios Block and is also absent in the distal domains of the basin Fig 9 Sequence 2SEQ2 extends across the entire internal and external proximal domains once again filling half graben basins formed over rotated crustal blocks Fig 9 Sequence 2SEQ2 can also be distin guished from 2SEQ1 by the fact it fills relatively large and broad depocentres Fig 9 In parallel 2SEQ2 is discordant over 2SEQ1 despite also showing growth strata against normal faults in FS2 In the inner 4 2 1st order sequences The upper boundary of the pre rift sequence in the proximal domain of the Santos Basin was adopted as the reference horizon marking the onset of crustal extension in the study area Fig 6a Hence a 1st order stratigraphic sequence 1SEQ1 characterized by the presence of growth strata filling relatively small half grabens is observed above the pre rift sequence Fig 7 The observed growth strata in 1SEQ1 correlates with the Early Rift and early part of the Upper Rift successions defined in Adriano et al 2022 In this context half graben basins with growth strata are predominantly identified in the inner proximal domain and in some parts of the Outer High i e within the outer proximal domain Fig 8a and b Sequence 1SEQ2 reveals two distinct stratal geometries in both the inner proximal domain and the western portion of the outer proximal domain It was deposited at the end of the Upper Rift stage of Fig 5 9

P R O Andrade et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 177 2025 107384 Fig 8 Seismic profiles showing the infill onlap downlap terminations and truncation geometries amongst 1st order syn rift sequences a 1SEQ1 and 1SEQ2 are separated by an angular unconformity that marks a major change in stratal geometry Sequence 1SEQ1 shows a divergent pattern against border faults it is thus syntectonic whereas 1SEQ2 is composed of isopachous strata onlapping the basin shoulders all in all revealing a sag like post tectonic geometry Also note the relative age relationships between fault systems with FS1 being rotated and cross cut by FS2 b FS2 reactivates FS1 and consequently 1SEQ2 also shows a divergent fill against basin shoulder faults c Seismic profile imaging a metamorphic core complex where part of 1SEQ1 is in contact with the lower crust Highlighted are primary faults synchronous with 1SEQ2 offsetting the entire sedimentary column and connected to the base to an anastomosed ductile shear zone in the lower crust A prominent angular truncation between 1SEQ1 and 1SEQ2 is observed in seismic data d Low angle onlaps and erosional truncation separating 1st order sequences 1SEQ2 and 1SEQ3 in the proximal domain of the Santos Basin as also observed in a and b In the distal domain a clearer unconformity is observed due to more pronounced tectonic activity as shown in d The salt unit is also offset by underlying faults and fills the resulting accommodation space On this same profile 1SEQ2 progressively disappears laterally towards the more distal parts of the margin while 1SEQ3 shows a syn tectonic stratal geometry See caption in Fig 7 for a description of main stratigraphic boundaries proximal domain 2SEQ2 can rest directly on top of interpreted lower crust rocks as highlighted in Fig 9 In the inner and outer proximal domains 2SEQ3 is the first to comprise at a regional scale depocentres filled with strata denoting a post tectonic sag type geometry Figs 10 and 11 Yet it still shows a syn tectonic geometry in the distal domain where the accommodation space created between faulted rotating crustal blocks was totally filled by growth strata see area highlighted by an orange rectangle from 400 km to 550 km in Fig 9 b The stratigraphic boundary separating 2SEQ2 and 2SEQ3 coincides with the most prominent angular unconformity in the proximal domain see blue arrows in Fig 10 In the inner proximal domain 2SEQ3 onlaps the first order unconformity that separates 1SEQ1 from 1SEQ2 see blue arrows in Fig 10 At the landwards shoulder of the inner proximal domain 2SEQ3 continues westwards onlapping the basement and relatively older strata see grey rectangle near 50 km in Fig 9 Such a character reveals that 1st and 2nd order sequence boundaries are amalgamated at the western tip of the internal proximal domain but they form separate unconformities towards local depocentres in the east i e oceanwards Figs 7 and 9 Low angle truncations separating 2SEQ3 and 2SEQ4 were observed in line B B between 10 km and 70 km see the red arrows in Fig 10 Here 2SEQ3 forms tighter synclines than 2SEQ4 and also below it generating shallow angle truncations in strata near 40 km in Fig 10 b This same pattern is repeated between 2SEQ4 and 2SEQ5 with shallowangle truncations and onlap terminations separating the two sequences see the white arrows in Figs 10 and 11 a character best observed in depocentres where accommodation space for sediment was quickly generated Geometric differences in 2nd order sequences are therefore interpreted as documenting overlapping deformation events In other words discrete deformation pulses were responsible for renewed rapid rates in accommodation space creation and subsequent lows were filled by correlative strata Thus high positive accommodation rates pre dominated in depocentres whereas low positive accommodation rates occurred over structural highs resulting in the omission and erosion of relatively older sequences Fragoso et al 2021 A key example of this process occurs in the Tupi field between wells W21 and W27 where 2SEQ3 and 2SEQ4 are absent At this same time faults that delimit the internal highs of the outer proximal domain were capable of juxtaposing sequences of distinct ages as highlighted by the yellow ellipses in Fig 11a and b In summary 2SEQ3 and 2SEQ4 fill the arched deformed palae otopography that was generated at the top of 1SEQ1 and thus onlap this latter unit see blue arrows in Fig 10 Similarly but revealing an angular relationship that is less clear 2SEQ5 fills the basin lows resulting from the synclinal arching of 2SEQ4 also onlapping the latter 2nd order sequence see white arrows in Figs 10 and 11 These struc tural and strata relationships allow us to use them as markers for the riftclimax stage sensu Prosser 1993 in the proximal domain of the Santos Basin Importantly such a relative chronology is observed throughout the entire proximal domain but is even clearer in evolving depocentres where the stratigraphic surfaces tend to be more separated in contrast to their adjacent structural highs On these highs unconformities tend to amalgamate and materialize important depositional hiatuses Adding to our interpretation 1SEQ3 comprises two 2nd order sequences 2SEQ5 and 2SEQ6 The oldest sequence 2SEQ5 is inter preted on regional ION GXT profiles crossing the distal domain where it fills the accommodation space generated by the rotation of crustal blocks Fig 9 Above 2SEQ5 a thick evaporite succession 2SEQ6 was still deposited synchronously with the movement of the faults delimiting some of the crustal blocks in the distal domain On regional 2D profiles 2SEQ5 is not clearly identified in the proximal domain but by nar rowing the scale of observation it can still be recognized in 3D seismic data Figs 10 and 11 It is also more readily interpreted north of the Búzios field where reflections in 2SEQ5 onlap the top of 2SEQ4 4 4 3rd order sequences Third order sequences were deposited in the smallest of depocentres developed in the study area Fig 12 and Table 1 Sequences of this order are those in which reservoir architecture tends to be analysed One of the best examples of 3rd order sequences and their bounding surfaces is observed in a depocentre formed adjacently to the Mero field Fig 12 In these conditions where depocentres provided sufficient accom modation space 3rd order sequences are well preserved and their bounding stratigraphic surfaces are clear in seismic data Prograding strata were identified near structural highs in both Búzios and Mero Fig 13 These geometries are generally associated with reworked strata Antunes et al 2024 Gomes et al 2020 and occur along the crests of local structural highs they were interpreted as 4th order sequences that reach thicknesses of hundreds of meters Barnett et al 2021a b Oliveira et al 2021 Their delineation is challenged by the resolution limits of the seismic data used in this work but a more complete characterization of such features is given in Min zoni et al 2021 5 Syn rift fault systems and their temporal relationship 5 1 Early rift fault system 1 FS1 Fault system 1 FS1 is recognized in the inner and outer proximal domains of the Santos Basin and characterized by the presence of NESW striking normal faults Fig 6a Faults in FS1 are staggered and bound highly rotated small scale half grabens Fig 9 Many of these half grabens were offset and eventually rotated by younger fault sys tems Our seismic data show that FS1 can be sub divided in two sub sets FS1 a and FS1 b both representing distinct degrees of fault displace ment and rotation FS1 a represents the oldest episode of half graben formation in the Santos Basin Fault rotation is so prominent in FS1 a that faults can appear in sub horizontal positions and are cross cut by younger struc tures see numbers 1 2 and 3 in Fig 10 FS1 a faults are not always easily mapped They are only observed where angular relationships either due to the rotation of the depocentres delimited by FS1 a faults or the favourable orientation of seismic sections are sufficiently clear In terms of their dimensions FS1 a faults are 1 6 5 5 km tall and 2 5 10 km long as shown in Fig 14 Fault System 1b FS1 b is identified in the inner and outer proximal domains of the Santos Basin where it bounds half grabens with a NE SW 12

P R O Andrade et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 177 2025 107384 basement structures The geometry of strata filling the depocentres delimited by FS1 faults suggests the formation of isolated lakes and these were followed by a stage of lake deepening that is materialized by 2SEQ1 Fig 18 In the outer proximal domain the transition between the Early Rift and the lower part of the Intermediate Rift stage a stage better defined farther south near the Tupi field is marked by a funda mental change in the geometry of evolving depocentres with prominent half grabens containing divergent growth strata Figs 9 and 10 below the 123 Ma old Late Barremian Synrift Unconformity LBRSU This Barremian stratigraphic marker separates sag type basins with iso pachous strata from clear syn rift depocentres below At this time the older half graben basins filled by 1SEQ1 were aborted and rotated deformed and in many cases offset by FS2 faults These newly formed faults created accommodation space for sediment above the LBRSU and cross cut or reactivated FS1 depending on their relative orientations This allowed for lake expansion and coalescence during 2SEQ2 leading to a more prominent vertical stacking of strata above the LBRSU Thus the unconformity separating 2SEQ1 from 2SEQ2 as well as the relative chronology of faulting revealed by FS1 a and FS1 b are interpreted in this work as the key markers of when the coalescence of these lakes started Fig 18 Karner and Driscoll 1999 and Karner 2000 interpret the period ranging from 130 Ma to 126 Ma Hauterivian equivalent to our 2SEQ1 as representing the first influx of sediments into the Santos Basin They associated it with the initial phase of distributed deformation that marks the onset of continental rifting We observe that the half grabens filled by 2SEQ1 were rotated by their boundary faults creating accommoda tion space that was subsequently filled by 2SEQ2 Importantly this same sequence 2SEQ2 Barremian in age filled half grabens than are broader than those in which 1SEQ1 is observed and mapped Figs 10 and 14c In selected seismic profiles the FS1 b structures that bound 2SEQ2 cross cut the older FS1 a Fig 10 Their angular relationship tends to wards orthogonality or even complete coupling when faults become sub parallel Rift depocentres were gently folded formed sag like synclines and generated the accommodation space filled by 2SEQ3 because of the relative movement between crustal blocks promoted by resulting from the onset of development of the FS2 fault The deposition of 2SEQ4 occurred at the end of this process where FS2 faults establish an internal hierarchy and their primary faults reach the base of the ridge This stage can be correlated with the Lake Expansion stage defined in Araújo et al 2023 According to these authors distributed fault related deforma tion lasted until the LBRSU 123 Ma Barremian and is roughly corre lated with the onset of FS2 s development Fig 18 In such a setting the proximal margin gradually focused strain and developed primary faults in FS2 The LBRSU unconformity thus marks the beginning of activity in FS2 with strata with a post tectonic geometry sag type initially filling the palaeo relief inherited from FS1 but then adopting a more isopachous continuous geometry towards the upper part of 2SEQ3 i e from late Barremian to the mid Aptian 117 Ma From mid to late Aptian 113 Ma deposition in 2SEQ4 occurred in sag type depocentres that are recognized by the presence of low angle erosional truncations at their base Figs 9 11 At this time the changing thermo mechanical conditions affecting the upper crust caused its fragmentation within a generalized brittle regime In contrast the lower crust was weak enough to allow the migration of the rift axis towards the distal domain but still too strong to allow the lower crust to massively flow Araújo et al 2023 This setting thinned the profile of the lithosphere with choke points being subsequently formed at the base of the upper crust together with the coupling of primary FS2 faults on the top of the lower crust e g Chenin et al 2020 2018 Mohn et al 2012 Ribes et al 2020 Such a setting seems to have allowed for a greater freedom of movement between crustal blocks delimiting discrete depocentres As a result of this same crustal block movement 1SEQ1 now rests directly on the lower crust in the inner proximal domain and its internal pattern is complex predominantly chaotic Fig 18 Fig 15 Statistical data for Fault System 2 FS2 a Log Log plot of fault height vs length for primary faults in FS2 b Log Log plot of fault height vs length for secondary faults in FS2 c Log Log plot of fault height vs length for small scale faults in FS2 d Comparison between height and length for all fault types in FS2 Note the scale jump observed for each fault sub set primary secondary and small scale faults 20

P R O Andrade et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 177 2025 107384 decreases as tectonic activity ensues and the margin evolves towards its continental breakup stage In practice this means that 1SEQ1 Lower Rift stage was deposited in a time span of 12 Ma 1SEQ2 Intermediate Rift stage lasted for 10 Ma and 1SEQ3 Late Rift stage lasted for 3 Ma while continental breakup was developing oceanwards from the Outer High of the Santos Basin The time span of 1SEQ3 includes the deposi tion of a thick salt unit in 2SEQ6 Fig 19 In contrast the 1st order drift sequence that overlies the Santos Basin rift basins records a time span of c 110 Ma based on Moreira et al 2007 grouping sets of faults when only using local geophysical or borehole data as the data in this paper clearly shows One needs to seek corre lations on a regional scale to discriminate between fault systems Our comprehensive data set shows there is no dimensional continuum in the fault systems interpreted in the Santos Basin The best fit power laws for each system show similar slopes but do not form a single straight line in the fault s height length log log plots see Fig 20 Instead they occupy almost parallel positions to each other revealing primary secondary and small scale fault clusters in Fig 15 e Fig 17 Based on such fault statistical data we argue that these data clusters reveal a hierarchical deformation process in the Santos Basin This is because it makes sense to think that faults are the product of the seismic tectonic activity that developed the rifted margin In support of this interpretation many publications have discussed how is hierarchical stress related to fault patterns They have confirmed that faulting patterns earthquake hypocentres and other seismological phenomena are neither geomet rically simple nor purely fractal at all scales Rather they are somewhat band limited Kato and Lei 2001 Kusunose et al 1991 Lei et al 1993 or hierarchical Cheremnykh et al 2020 Ouillon et al 1996 Seminsky and Cheremnykh 2011 Different power laws hold separately in all or some of these bands Lei et al 1993 Lei and Kusunose 1999 7 2 Fault system classification and relationship with syn rift stratigraphic sequences This work made possible to associate the evolution of syn rift fault systems and their related stratigraphic sequences along the full width of a rifted continental margin Figs 18 and 19 In fact the statistical data in Figs 14 Fig 15 Fig 17 and mainly in Fig 20 show primary and secondary faults belonging to different phases i e belonging to defor mation events separated in time However they share similar fields and very similar dimensions see dashed ellipses in Fig 20 This character explains the difficulty in accurately separating or Fig 20 Comparison of fault height vs length data for primary secondary and small scale faults in all interpreted fault systems Note that without a prior knowledge of faults relative chronology structures with distinct ages and dimensions may share the same dimensional field see dashed ellipse 25

P R O Andrade et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 177 2025 107384 Hence different power laws may be valid in all or some of these band ranges Lei et al 1993 Lei and Kusunose 1999 Rotevatn et al 2019 a concept that corroborates what is observed in the graphs in Figs 14 15 17 and 20 At first one is led to think that primary faults in FS1 FS2 and FS3 are the largest This holds true within a set of synchronous faults but when considering fault systems and discrete faults of different ages such a postulate becomes hard to validate particularly within a continental rifting setting where the thickness of the crust changes in time and space Thus the dimensions of primary faults can and do vary in the Santos Basin depending on the domain in which they occur i e their di mensions vary depending on the stage of development of the rifting continental margin on which they originate As a result primary faults in the inner and outer proximal domains tend to be larger than faults formed exclusively in the distal domain the crustal thickness is greater in the proximal domain of the Santos Basin when compared to its distal domain Fig 20 This is a character also reflected in the size of rotated crustal blocks which are larger in the internal proximal domain and smaller in the outer proximal domain of the margin Figs 7 and 9b It is thus important to highlight that comparing syn rift fault systems only makes sense when dealing with synchronous faults It makes no sense to compare the dimensions and evolutions of faults that are diachronous and responded to distinct stress conditions and tectonic events see Figs 14 15 17 and 20 Likewise analysing fault dimensions alone does not suffice as method for classifying faults For instance primary faults in FS1 secondary faults in FS2 and FS3 as well as the smaller ancillary faults in FS2 have all similar dimensions as illustrated in Fig 20 Our approach allows us to suggest that a faults were first generated with similar sizes during the Early Rift stage and b they were differ entiated into different fault systems throughout the margin development process Therefore relatively small faults coalesced as continental rift ing ensued Primary faults in FS1 FS2 and FS3 developed where crustal deformation was focused to favour specific locations for the later rupture of the upper crust In other words faults only became primary after they ruptured the entire crust Importantly factors such as rheo logical contrasts in the crust the existence of a pre existent structural fabric time and spatial changes in the thermo mechanical conditions of the margin controlled which faults evolved as primary structures making it difficult to accurately predict in forward models which fault in larger set will rupture the crust to become a primary structure This is a caveat that requires in depth studies beyond the original purpose of this work Our data suggest that the faults nucleated along basement sutures or significant tectonic contacts between basement terrains were more successful in delineating crustal blocks in the later stages of con tinental rifting Yet changes in the dynamics and regional stress con ditions of continental rifting could still have led to the nucleation and development of new faults that did not necessarily originate from the coalescence of pre existing faults Figs 9 and 12 Finally the relationship between the hierarchies of stratigraphic sequences and corresponding fault systems depends on the geological context of continental rifting e g on the evolutionary history of the future continental margin As demonstrated for the Santos Basin the dimensions and areal extent of 1st order sequences can be much larger than the dimensions of discrete half graben depocentres i e 1st order sequences can fill several depocentres delimited by primary fault sys tems This is why 1st order stratigraphic sequences and their bounding surfaces are ideal for mapping and laterally correlate basins at a continental margin scale see Figs 6 and 9 As for correlations across each margin domain 2nd order sequences and their bounding surfaces are more efficient allowing for a better discretization of stratigraphic stacking relationships and also the deformation processes affecting each margin domain see Figs 9 and 11 Lastly 3rd and 4th order sequences were recorded only in specific parts of the margin near small scale ancillary faults see Figs 12 and 16 In parts of the study area both 3rd order sequences and associated faults were resolved well enough in seismic data to allow their identification In less favourable or more complex contexts such an interpretation can be hard to attain 7 3 Stratigraphic responses to tectonic stimuli The outer proximal domain of the Santos Basin records a drastic change in structural style and also in the way accommodation space became available for sediment across the study area compared to the inner proximal margin Subsidence was focused on the faults that define crustal blocks of the outer proximal domain In general terms this deformation style aligns with the numerical models of lithospheric extension on rifted continental margins Araújo et al 2023 Chenin et al 2022 Manatschal et al 2022 However primary detachment faults in FS2 die out at the top of the lower crust not in the mantle despite clearly breaking through the upper crust The distal domain also does not assume the classic architecture of a hyperextended margin despite presenting a significant degree of crustal thinning and evident crustal block movement rotation and segmentation Fig 20 Part of the study area is located over a regional transfer zone RJTZ Fig 6 and a typical hyperextension profile was not achieved as the faults do fully offset the crust At the onset of movement in FS2 the upper crust recorded flexural rebound near primary faults in the outer proximal domain as inter preted from the concentration of fault throws at the edges of the crustal blocks followed by the gentle arching of the footwalls where the onlapping of 1SEQ3 over 1SEQ2 or 2SEQ5 over 2SEQ4 in the 2ndorder is observed see Figs 8 10 12 and 16 Consequently surface topography was rejuvenated and depositional gradients changed near and at the scale of the imaged crustal blocks Such phenomena occurring in association with fault reactivation justifies evoking late movement of crustal blocks in the outer proximal domain which continued until FS3 was generated and 1SEQ3 was deposited Fig 9 Evidence for these relative tectonic movements is gathered by the lowangle truncations separating 2SEQ3 and 2SEQ4 which are synchro nous with the propagation of FS2 and subsequent formation of the outer proximal domain The development of FS2 is obvious in seismic data due to the clear fault displacements and cross cutting relationships FS2 reveals with FS1 2SEQ1 and 2SEQ2 see numbers 1 2 and 3 in Fig 10 In fact FS2 offsets the crust and fragments the Outer High into discrete crustal blocks with the resulting movement of primary and secondary faults in this system controlling depositional gradients Figs 9 and 11 Secondary faults in FS2 controlled accommodation space and depositional gradients in the study area but their influence is smaller than that of primary faults in this same system Figs 18 and 19 Nevertheless they were important enough to promote relative movement amongst adjacent structural highs thereby creating the local accommodation space in which 2SEQ3 and 2SEQ4 were preserved Fig 9a and 19 The stratigraphic record of the Outer High which is mainly related to the onset and later development of FS2 can therefore be understood as the convolution of three processes operating at different scales The first and most signifi cant of processes is that acting on the regional geodynamic scale as it controlled the profile of crustal thinning and the regional depositional gradient of the Santos Basin This scale is represented stratigraphically by 1st order sequences in each of the margin domains whose develop ment followed the direction of rift axis migration The second of these processes the tilting of the crustal blocks at an intermediate scale responded to the development and movement of specific syn rift faults It is represented by the formation of primary and secondary faults in FS2 which only penetrated through the upper crust and allowed for the relative movement of deforming crustal blocks Accommodation space between these crustal blocks was filled by 2nd order sequences The third process reflecting the movement of local structural highs on top or between crustal blocks was controlled by small scale faults in FS2 and generated accommodation at the local scale filled by 3rd order se quences Fig 9 Figs 12 and 18 26

P R O Andrade et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 177 2025 107384 Figs 18 and 19 Not being the primary focus of this study the distal domain never theless comprises the tectono stratigraphic record of the Santos Basin during its final evolutionary stages continental breakup In this regard the nucleation of primary and secondary faults in FS3 delaminated the already highly thinned upper crust by forming a set of detachment faults Epin and Manatschal 2018 Lymer et al 2019 Fig 9 b This process destabilized the outer proximal domain mechanically forcing it to adjust via the smaller scale ancillary faults in FS3 Fig 9 Additionally flexural rebound followed by thermal driven subsidence resulted in the onlapping of 1SEQ3 over 1SEQ2 in the outer proximal domain Figs 9 18 and 19 Coherent and robust correlations between producing fields and structural compartments in the Santos Basin depends on analyses that span different scales of observation As a corollary of our work we suggest in Fig 21 a modified stratigraphic chart for the Santos Basin to better represent the process of oceanward migration of the rift axis and related depocentres Even if the ages of tectonic event sequences are updated in future work the truncation relationships between sequences and fault systems will be maintained By the end of the development of primary faults in FS2 the Outer High of the Santos Basin became limited by a metamorphic core complex separating the outer proximal from the inner proximal domains Figs 7 and 8c Such an event suggests that near this core complex 2SEQ2 began its deposition under an extensional regime dominated by halfgraben depocentres but with the progressive development of the metamorphic core complex some depocentres were somehow involved in subsequent deformation episodes affecting the Santos Basin Thus 2SEQ2 points out to a late emplacement of the metamorphic core complex as this sequence is deformed rotated and the upper crust below was faulted and broken putting 2SEQ2 in direct contact with the lower crust This is a possible interpretation for the origin of the meta morphic core complex with consequence for the evolution of adjacent depocentres In this case the depocentres delimited by FS1 a and FS1 b faults were aborted and became defined by FS2 structures Low angle truncations were formed between 2SEQ4 2SEQ5 and 2SEQ5 2SEQ6 at a later stage when deformation was focused on the faults that limit main crustal blocks Figs 9 and 11 A relative late movement of crustal blocks explains the generation of the accommo dation space needed for the stacking of the Itapema Formation an equivalent unit to 2SEQ3 Fig 5 According to Antunes et al 2024 the Itapema Formation was deposited in environments that became progressively shallower into the Barra Velha Formation 2SEQ4 into 2SEQ5 However siliciclastic mudstones mark the top of the Itapema Formation immediately below the Pre Alagoas Unconformity PAU around 117 Ma indicating a significant deepening of the lake that drowned the coquina section Antunes et al 2024 This can be explained by evoking late crustal block movement rebound close to the limits of crustal blocks and accompanying tectonic subsidence Based on our data we interpret that most of the accommodation space for 2SEQ5 and 2SEQ6 resulted from the combination of thermal subsidence and tectonic stimuli acting on primary faults some of these distant from the structural highs over which oil fields are located Figs 11 and 12 Thus not all the stratigraphic record preserved in the Outer High s oil fields particularly between 2SEQ5 and 2SEQ6 results from local tectonic stimuli acting on faults immediately below or around them Rather we stress the significance of distant tectonic stimuli focused on the boundaries of main crustal blocks with these stimuli having been significant in the Intermediate Rift and Late Rift stages 8 Conclusions A detailed integration of geodynamic tectonic structural geology and sequence stratigraphic data was attained to address the spatiotem poral evolution of syn rift faults and their related stratigraphic units on the Outer High of the Santos Basin This approach involved the use of a suite of high resolution 2D and 3D seismic surveys tied to stratigraphic data from 155 boreholes and resulted in the identification of three 3 main fault systems near some of the most prolific fields in SE Brazil These fault systems were characterized in terms of their dimensions geometries structural styles and trends The results of this work can be summarized as follows a The three 3 fault systems identified during the rifting and crustal thinning process controlled the evolution of inner proximal outer proximal and distal domains in the Santos Basin b The fault systems identified in seismic data are of different ages controlled deposition in extensional basins evolving at different Fig 21 Revised stratigraphic chart for the Santos Basin taking into account the progressive oceanward migration of the rift axis with time and the temporal evolution of related depocentres The outer contour of the proposed chart represents a simplification of the Wheeler s diagram shown in

Caracterização de área do Pré sal da Bacia de Santos INTRODUÇÃO A história exploratória da Bacia de Santos sem grande importância na produção nacional até o início dos anos 2000 começou a ganhar destaque e relevância com as novas descobertas do Pré sal Neste contexto se deu a descoberta da área de Tupi hoje denominado campo de Tupi em 2006 no alto externo da Bacia de Santos Os reservatórios nesta área são compostos por depósitos carbonáticos das fases rifte e pós rifte está também denominada de fase sag termo que será utilizado neste trabalho constituindo a chamada seção Pré sal representando um novo play de classe mundial descoberto na margem continental brasileira Chang et al 2008 Artagão 2018 Dada a relevância econômica destas descobertas muitos trabalhos estão sendo realizados na avaliação regional e na análise estratigráfica e de fácies destes depósitos carbonáticos Entretanto a caracterização de detalhe dos reservatórios do Pré sal ainda é um desafio principalmente quanto à previsibilidade da qualidade do reservatório que é controlada pela distribuição de fácies Uma adequada caracterização estrutural e a reconstrução da paleogeografia dos reservatórios à época da deposição o que constitui a proposta central do estudo aqui apresentado é fundamental para melhorar a previsibilidade das fácies dos reservatórios carbonáticos existentes na Bacia de Santos Dias et al 1988 Wright e Barnett 2015 A área de Iracema Figura 1 localizada dentro dos limites do campo de Tupi foi selecionada para este estudo por estar em um contexto estrutural distinto no alto externo da Bacia de Santos apresentando uma orientação estrutural NW SE em uma região com orientação estrutural predominante NE SW possivelmente influenciada pelo denominado lineamento Iracema Magnavita et al 2010 A este lineamento é atribuído um importante papel nas reativações das falhas rifte durante a deposição dos carbonatos da fase sag A tectônica ativa durante a fase sag implica em um forte controle estrutural na deposição das fácies carbonáticas que será discutido no decorrer do trabalho Uma incerteza crítica nos modelos de subsuperfície é a geometria estrutural e a cinemática dos eventos A restauração estrutural pode ser a única maneira prática para validar um modelo estrutural e entender a sequência de eventos e suas incertezas Neste contexto de incertezas e considerando se reservatórios mais complexos e com menor acesso à coleta de dados que apresentam alto custo e dependem tempo na implantação dos projetos as restaurações podem ter um valor agregado enorme para os planos de desenvolvimento da produção Groshong Jr et al 2012 Buscando se representar melhor os padrões de deformação associados a falhas além da modelagem mecânica de falhas e sistemas de falhas a indústria e a academia têm desenvolvido o conceito de restauração 2D Dunbar e Cook 2003 Maerten e Maerten 2006 e 3D Maerten 2007 O desenvolvimento destas ferramentas tem o intuito de melhor predizer os condicionantes de sistemas petrolíferos 3D de áreas de interesse construir superfícies de paleo relevo para serem usadas no controle de deposição dos sedimentos prever as condições de variação de esforços e com isso predizer o modelo de fraturas além de serem utilizados para validar interpretações estruturais No presente estudo foi realizada a caracterização estrutural e a reconstrução da paleogeografia à época da deposição do intervalo sag dos reservatórios carbonáticos da Formação Barra Velha que se depositaram em uma condição de reativações de falhas que condicionaram a pa ACF Alto de Cabo Frio AF Plataforma de Florianópolis DSP Dorsal de São Paulo Figura 1 Localização da área de estudo AE e poços selecionados na área A a G O retângulo vermelho corresponde à área interpretada no dado sísmico 52 Geol USP Sér cient São Paulo v 24 n 1 p 51 72 Março 2024

Carvalho R K et al leogeografia e por consequência a distribuição das fácies Através da técnica da restauração 2D de multi seções é possível restaurar estas geometrias das superfícies a fim de melhorar a previsibilidade da distribuição das fácies carbonáticas existentes na área de interesse A Bacia de Santos situa se na margem continental sudeste do Brasil entre os paralelos 23º e 28º sul abrangendo os litorais dos estados do Rio de Janeiro São Paulo Paraná e Santa Catarina Ocupa uma área de cerca de 350 000 km² até a cota batimétrica de 3 000 m sendo limitada geograficamente da Bacia de Campos ao norte pelo Alto de Cabo Frio e da Bacia de Pelotas ao sul pela Plataforma de Florianópolis Figura 1 O embasamento da bacia é representado pelo Sistema Orogênico da Mantiqueira correspondendo a terrenos metamórficos e ígneos com estruturação predominantemente NE SW formados durante a amalgamação da porção oeste do Gondwana durante o processo orogênico conhecido como evento Brasiliano no Neoproterozoico Almeida et al 1981 Heilbron et al 2004 Almeida et al 2013 A bacia foi formada em um regime tectônico distensivo durante a fragmentação do supercontinente Gondwana Ocidental iniciada no Eocretáceo que culminou com a separação entre o Brasil e a África e a abertura do Atlântico Sul sendo classificada como uma típica bacia de margem distensiva Milani et al 2007 Os processos de rifteamento que originaram a Bacia de Santos nuclearam se ao longo de estruturas preexistentes do embasamento que governaram a arquitetura das principais feições do sistema rifte com as principais falhas normais herdando a direção NE SW Esta direção é predominante em uma estrutura conhecida como Alto Externo da Bacia de Santos Gomes et al 2008 e 2012 onde está localizada a área do presente estudo Esta direção predominante do embasamento é obliqua a direção de abertura do rifte E W resultando em regime tectônico geral de transtensão sinistral durante a abertura da bacia Macedo 1990 Meisling et al 2001 Milani et al 2005 Os estudos de Dehler et al 2016 identificaram um lineamento magnético denominado Helmut que é o limite entre o Rifte Inferior e o Exterior Rigoti 2015 que possui direção NE SW na Bacia de Santos e que sofre uma inflexão para a direção N S na Bacia de Campos Este lineamento traz consigo a mesma direção das zonas de cisalhamento neoproterozoicas e possui uma extensão aproximada de 1000 km Conforme interpretado a partir de mapas magnéticos e gravimétricos o lineamento Helmut conecta estruturalmente às estruturas NNE das Bacias de Campos e Santos por meio de uma zona de cisalhamento frágil obliqua à estrutura do rifte da Bacia de Santos atuando como uma grande zona de transferência No Aptiano tardio esta estrutura atuou como uma zona de cisalhamento sinistral transtativa que perturba a direção das falhas NNE na direção NE próximo à zona de falha e reativa falhas do rifte desorganizando a bacia evaporítica do Atlântico Sul promovendo a movimentação do sal e gerando domos principalmente de halita Estruturas de menor expressão ocorrem nas direções ENE WSW e E W Zalán e Oliveira 2005 sendo também observadas zonas de transferência com orientação NW SE induzidas pela abertura obliqua da Bacia de Santos Meisling et al 2001 afetando tanto o embasamento como unidades mais novas até o Eoceno ao ponto de remarcar domínios diferenciados da tectônica salífera condicionando a estruturação dos domos salinos Souza 2008 Rigoti 2015 Segundo Meisling et al 2001 estas estruturas NW progressivamente mudam para a direção E W perto da zona de transição continente crosta oceânica Magnavita et al 2010 analisando as falhas e mapas de contorno estrutural da Bacia de Santos na seção Pré sal ao norte da área de estudo identificaram uma importante feição denominada de S de Santos que marca a mudança do arcabouço estrutural Esta feição está relacionada à mudança da orientação das falhas de direção NE SW para as direções NW SE e N S influenciada pela presença de zonas de transferência regionais NW SE Uma destas zonas de transferência denominada de Iracema Magnavita et al 2010 é de especial interesse para a área investigada no presente estudo devido a sua proximidade modificando a direção das estruturas presentes na área de Iracema impondo às falhas uma orientação principal NW SE A fase pós rifte ou fase sag da bacia iniciada a partir do Eoaptiano é caracterizada por uma subsidência regional associada ao resfriamento litosférico Moreira et al 2007 A atividade tectônica associada às falhas diminui restringindo se a reativações das principais falhas da fase rifte Dias 2005 Mohriak et al 2008 Diversos autores no entanto identificam durante a fase sag definida por Moreira et al 2007 uma tectônica ativa na Bacia de Santos com a movimentação de falhas e criação de espaço durante a deposição dos carbonatos Karner e Gambôa 2007 Buckley et al 2015 Faria et al 2017 Os trabalhos de Torsvik et al 2009 e Moulin et al 2013 propõem que a tectônica sin rifte estaria afetando inclusive a deposição do sal que estão sobrepostos aos carbonatos Nos trabalhos de Dehler et al 2023 e Adriano et al 2022 é proposta uma última fase rifte concomitante à deposição do intervalo superior dos carbonatos da Formação Barra Velha De acordo com Moreira et al 2007 as rochas que constituem o Pré sal da Bacia de Santos são relacionadas à evolução da bacia durante as fases rifte e pós rifte sendo reunidas no Grupo Guaratiba Figura 2 composto pelas formações Camboriú derrames de basaltos toleíticos ocorridos durante o Neocomiano Piçarras depositada durante o período de maior atividade tectônica no andar Barremiano e composta de arenitos e pelitos de composição talco estevensítica e folhelhos escuros depositados nas porções

Caracterização de área do Pré sal da Bacia de Santos e packstones bioclásticos nos altos estruturais originados pela atividade tectônica e intercalações de mudstones lamitos e folhelhos escuros ricos em matéria orgânica nos baixos estruturais e Barra Velha depositada durante o Aptiano em ambiente transicional entre continental e marinho raso e composta por calcários estromatolíticos laminitos microbiais e microbialitos ricos em talco e argilas magnesianas nas porções associadas a altos estruturais presentes no alto externo da Bacia de Santos e folhelhos e folhelhos carbonáticos nas porções distais intercalados com as fácies in situ podem ocorrer também grainstones e packstones compostos por fragmentos dos estromatólitos e bioclastos O limite entre as formações Itapema e Barra Velha é a discordância Pré Alagoas DPA datada em 123 1 Ma e de acordo com Moreira et al 2007 corresponde ao limite entre as fases rifte e pós rifte ou fase sag No entanto trabalhos mais recentes Buckley et al 2015 Wright e Barnett 2015 Faria et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 propõem que a passagem para a fase pós rifte seja associada à discordância Intra Alagoas de idade 117 Ma definida por Moreira et al 2007 durante a deposição da Formação Barra Velha Com esta nova interpretação a Formação Barra Velha foi depositada em dois regimes tectônicos distintos sendo a porção inferior em um contexto tectônico rifte com a presença de geometria de cunha ainda que menos proeminente do que as feições observadas no rifte inferior formações Piçarras e Itapema Esta diferença pode estar associada à taxa de movimentação das falhas que criaram o espaço ou à diferença da taxa de sedimentação dos carbonatos sin rifte Buckley et al 2015 A porção superior da Formação Barra Velha foi depositada em contexto tectônico pós rifte durante o processo de subsidência regional associada ao resfriamento litosférico Moreira et al 2007 adquirindo um padrão de preenchimento do tipo sag Neste período com uma baixa atividade tectônica associada a falhas existiram falhas ainda ativas durante a deposição dos carbonatos relacionadas a reativações das principais falhas da fase rifte Dias 2005 Mohriak et al 2008 Karner e Gambôa 2007 Como citado acima os trabalhos de Torsvik et al 2009 e Moulin et al 2013 consideram que DIA Discordância Intra Alagoas DPA Discordância Pré Alagoas modificado de Moreira et al 2007 Figura 2 Diagrama estratigráfico da Bacia de Santos O retângulo vermelho representa o intervalo estratigráfico abordado no presente trabalho intervalo superior da Formação Barra Velha Foi realizada uma modificação do diagrama original alterando o topo da sequência rifte para junto da discordância Intra Alagoas conforme proposto por Buckley et al 2015 e Wright e Barnett 2015 54 Geol USP Sér cient São Paulo v 24 n 1 p 51 72 Março 2024

Carvalho R K et al o intervalo superior da Fm Barra Velha estaria incluso ainda em uma fase sin rifte Adriano et al 2022 propõem uma terceira fase rifte rifte tardio para a Bacia de Santos concomitante a deposição da parte superior da Fm Barra Velha e esta estaria associada a uma direção principal dos lineamentos NW SE que predominam na área de Iracema Wright e Barnett 2015 contestaram a origem microbial dos carbonatos da Formação Barra Velha propondo um modelo abiótico para a sua deposição em um ambiente lacustre altamente alcalino sem influência marinha A influência marinha é descartada devido à ausência de fósseis marinhos incluindo fósseis típicos de ambiente marinho restrito como foraminíferos miliolídeos A ausência de minerais de sulfato como gipsita e anidrita também corrobora que estes carbonatos não se depositaram em ambiente de água marinha Nas observações feitas por Wright e Barnett 2015 em amostras macroscópicas e em lâminas delgadas foram verificadas poucas evidências da ocorrência de atividade e presença microbiana e com isso para os autores parece impróprio usar o nome microbialito Apesar dos diferentes modelos paleoambientais discutidos na literatura para os carbonatos do Pré sal em todas as melhores fácies reservatórios se depositariam nos altos estruturais evidenciando o controle da paleogeografia na deposição das fácies carbonáticas Artagão 2018 apresenta uma proposta de distribuição das fácies em função da energia e batimetria do lago evidenciando a necessidade de se determinar a paleobatimetria do lago para a correta predição das fácies Finalizando a fase pós rifte da Bacia de Santos após o ciclo carbonático da Formação Barra Velha com topo definido em 113 Ma ocorreu a deposição da Formação Ariri Figura 2 Trabalhos recentes têm contestado esta idade do início da deposição do sal Lima et al 2018 Pietzsch et al 2020 Tedeschi et al 2017 2019 A partir da correlação de isótopos de carbono com as seções do Tethyan foi possível correlacionar o fim da deposição dos evaporitos ao intervalo 1 do Evento Anóxido Oceânico do Aptiano datado entre 125 e 124 Ma Tedeschi et al 2019 No entanto o trabalho de Szatmari et al 2021 contesta estas novas idades através de datações utilizando argônio Estes propõem no seu trabalho uma idade entre 116 e110 Ma mais usual para o intervalo evaporítico A Fm Ariri é constituída por evaporitos depositados em um intervalo de tempo estimado entre 0 7 a 1 Ma segundo estudo de Dias 1998 durante o Neoaptiano Moreira et al 2007 Os evaporitos de maior ocorrência na Bacia de Santos são a halita e a anidrita entretanto também se constata sais mais solúveis tais como taquidrita carnalita e silvinita Rodriguez et al 2018 No limite entre o Aptiano e o Albiano 112Ma o processo de ruptura efetivamente se propaga em direção à Bacia de Santos Durante o Albiano 106Ma ocorre enfim o breakup e abertura do Oceano Atlântico Equatorial permitindo a conexão franca entre o Oceano Atlântico Sul e o Oceano Atlântico Central Oceano Thetis finalizando assim o processo de separação do Gondwana Ocidental Após o breakup inicia se a fase drifte da bacia Figura 2 que é composta pelos grupos Camburi composto por carbonatos marinhos e folhelhos radioativos e margas Frade sistema de leques aluviais até pelitos e arenitos batiais depositados do final do Cenomaniano até o limite Cretáceo Paleógeno que culminou com uma regressão marinha no final do Cretáceo e Itamambuca sedimentos depositados do Paleógeno até o presente correspondendo a depósitos de leques aluviais proximais que gradam para pelitos e arenitos batiais nas porções distais com ocorrências de sedimentação carbonática mista próximo à quebra da plataforma A sequência drifte é bastante deformada por tectônica gravitacional em função da movimentação do intervalo de sal do relevo preexistente e do progressivo basculamento do embasamento Pichel et al 2020 Geol USP Sér cient São Paulo v 24 n 1 p 51 72 Março 2024 55 BASE DE DADOS E MÉTODOS O estudo foi dividido em quatro etapas Figura 3 abordando os seguintes tópicos construção do arcabouço estrutural estratigráfico através da correlação de poços e interpretação sísmica reconstrução estrutural de horizontes estratigráficos da área de interesse através da restauração de múltiplas seções construção de mapas de paleobatimetria para o intervalo estratigráfico de interesse e aplicação de uma das superfícies paleobatimétrica restauradas em uma modelagem de processos estratigráficos e sedimentológicos realizada no intervalo superior da fase sag Para a etapa de restauração estrutural foi utilizado o software Recon produto de um convênio entre a Petrobras e a PUC Rio que utiliza os princípios da restauração mecânica através de modelos numéricos de elementos finitos Santi 2002 Todas as demais etapas foram realizadas utilizando o software Petrel Schlumberger A base de dados contou com as informações de sete poços selecionados na área de Iracema e o dado sísmico 3D RO276 BS500 MERGE PSDM FASE2 migrado em profundidade Os dados dos poços e o dado sísmico foram fornecidos pela Agência Nacional do Petróleo Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis ANP através do Banco de Dados de Exploração e Produção BDEP ANP de acordo com a Resolução ANP n 757 de 23 de novembro de 2018 A área estudada é limitada por um retângulo de arestas de 22 x 28 km totalizando 616 km² Figura 1 Devido à baixa qualidade do dado sísmico antes de iniciar o mapeamento dos horizontes foi feito um tratamento com o objetivo de ter um dado mais contínuo e menos ruidoso Além do dado de amplitude do sinal sísmico utilizado foi construído o atributo Variance que identifica descontinuidades no sinal permitindo a identificação de falhas mapeáveis na escala sísmica Van Bemmel et al 2000 A construção do arcabouço tectono estratigráfico envolveu a interpretação e correlação de perfis dos poços e o mapeamento sísmico de superfícies estratigráficas e falhas na área de interesse Os perfis utilizados nesta etapa foram

Carvalho R K et al baseado em krigagem Foi gerado um variograma com alcance máximo de 5 000 m e mínimo de 3 000 m utilizando como direção de anisotropia a orientação geral do alto de Iracema N30W Os horizontes restaurados foram convertidos em um mapa de paleobatimetria através de uma equação construída para transformar a superfície restaurada na superfície batimétrica do lago no momento da deposição respeitando os dados de perfis de porosidade dos poços e utilizando dados bibliográficos sobre a caracterização estratigráfica e faciológica dos reservatórios carbonáticos da seção Pré sal da Bacia de Santos Faria et al 2017 Artagão 2018 e de análogos recentes Cohen et al 1997 Esta metodologia modifica o trabalho de Faria et al 2017 onde ela propõe a construção da paleobatimetria do lago a partir dos horizontes restaurados porém em seu trabalho ela normaliza os valores da superfície restaurada para um range de profundidade do lago Para demonstrar a aplicabilidade do produto final da construção dos mapas paleobatimétricos foi realizaTabela 1 Valores atribuídos aos parâmetros porosidade decaimento da porosidade e densidade para os intervalos definidos para a restauração

restrito ao retrabalhamento das fácies formadas in situ na própria estrutura Para controlar a subsidência foi construído um mapa de isópacas do intervalo sag superior A espessura do intervalo foi dividida pelo tempo estimado para a deposição deste intervalo sendo considerado um período de 2 Ma entre 115 e 113 Ma resultando em um mapa de subsidência O condicionamento do nível de variação do lago durante a simulação foi feito através da construção de uma curva de alta frequência a partir dos dados dos perfis de raios gama e ressonância magnética sendo também utilizados dados bibliográficos produzidos em áreas análogas Faria et al 2017 Artagão 2018 Para o controle do suprimento sedimentar foram construídas curvas de produtividade para as fácies carbonáticas in situ em função da batimetria de acordo com dados bibliográficos sobre a caracterização estratigráfica e faciológica dos reservatórios carbonáticos da seção Pré sal da Bacia de Santos Faria et al 2017 Artagão 2018 e de análogos recentes Cohen et al 1997 A deposição de fácies carbonáticas retrabalhadas foi simulada através de eventos autocíclicos relacionados a ondas causando erosão das fácies precipitadas in situ As ondas foram consideradas como tendo origem na parte leste e nordeste do Alto de Iracema de acordo com dados obtidos por Minzoni et al 2021 em uma região ao norte da área de Iracema RESULTADOS Interpretação estratigráfica dos poços da uma modelagem de processos especificamente neste caso uma modelagem numérica sedimentológica estatigráfica que é uma ferramenta útil para a análise de sistemas carbonáticos permitindo reproduzir cenários da arquitetura interna da plataforma carbonática em resposta às variações da deposição erosão retrabalhamento dos sedimentos e variação do nível de base sendo estes parâmetros fortemente controlados pela batimetria inicial Bosence et al 1994 A modelagem de processos foi realizada para o intervalo sag superior utilizando como dado de entrada duas superfícies paleobatimétricas para comparação dos resultados a que foi construída a partir da restauração do horizonte intermediário do intervalo sag e uma superfície construída a partir do horizonte originalmente interpretado na sísmica Neste tipo de modelagem três controles estratigráficos principais são considerados o espaço de acomodação que varia em função da subsidência e da variação do nível do lago o suprimento sedimentar que para as fácies carbonáticas é controlado pela paleobatimetria e taxa de acumulação dos carbonatos e o transporte que no caso das fácies A seção sag da Formação Barra Velha foi dividida em dois intervalos sag inferior e sag superior a partir da identificação nos poços B e F de um contato entre uma zona argilosa abaixo e o reservatório carbonático Figura 4 Este contato é denominado no presente estudo como superfície BVE INT O intervalo sag inferior estende se desde o topo da seção rifte da Formação Barra Velha BVE INF que corresponde a DIA Discordância Intra Alagoas até a superfície BVE INT O intervalo sag superior é delimitado na base pela superfície BVE INT e no topo pela superfície aqui denominada BVE SUP que é coincidente com o topo do reservatório e base do sal A zona argilosa do intervalo inferior é caracterizada no perfil de ressonância magnética por leituras com alta porosidade total e baixa porosidade de fluido livre O intervalo sag inferior também apresenta leituras de raios gama mais elevadas do que o intervalo sag superior No intervalo sag superior nenhum poço na área de estudo amostrou as

Caracterização de área do Pré sal da Bacia de Santos rior não foi amostrado nenhum poço com fácies argilosas indicando uma fase de retração do lago com depósitos em um ambiente litorâneo com maior concentração de íons e deposição de rochas carbonáticas hipótese também sugerida pela ocorrência de laminitos com feição de exposição no topo do reservatório que foram identificados e descritos por Faria et al 2017 Além das mudanças das condições deposicionais outra evidência da atuação da zona de transferência de Iracema é a orientação da estrutura e das falhas mapeadas As principais falhas que originaram a Bacia de Santos no Eocretáceo nuclearam se ao longo de estruturas preexistentes herdando a direção NE SW do embasamento A maior parte da estrutura conhecida como Alto Externo da Bacia de Santos Gomes et al 2008 2012 onde está localizada a área do presente estudo apresenta esta orientação A presença da zona de transferência de Iracema de direção NW SE oblíqua à orientação NE SW dominante na bacia combinação que resulta na estrutura do S de Santos Magnavita et al 2010 influenciou na mudança da direção para NNW SSE que predomina na área de Iracema Esta mudança é gradual e modifica a estrutura à medida que se aproxima da zona de transferência a sul da área ainda se observam falhas na direção NE SW que se modificam para NNW SSE no norte da área de Iracema As falhas normais interpretadas na área de Iracema possuem rejeito nos intervalos inferior e superior da seção sag algumas apresentando rejeito até mesmo na base do sal A reativação de falhas que se formaram durante a fase rifte da bacia e atuaram sin deposicionalmente durante a fase sag sugere que na área de estudo não ocorreu uma quiescência tectônica como proposto por Moreira et al 2007 Outros autores já descreveram esta reativação de falhas durante a fase sag da bacia como Karner e Gambôa 2007 e Buckley et al 2015 Faria et al 2017 observaram em seu estudo a reativação de falhas sin e pós deposicionais Essa reativação estaria relacionada à migração do eixo do rifte em direção às porções mais distais da bacia ao longo da história de deformação da crosta continental Essa migração pode explicar a ocorrência de regiões sem deformação rúptil em posições mais próximas à margem enquanto em regiões mais distantes teríamos um regime de rifte ativo que causaria deformações menores em posições intermediárias da bacia Rigoti 2015 demonstrou o diacronismo do preenchimento sedimentar e da estruturação do rifte representado pela migração lateral da deformação que acontece em função da focalização dos esforços deformacionais com as estruturas mais jovens ocorrendo em direção ao oceano ou ao sítio do futuro breakup A estrutura do Alto Externo com uma direção predominante NE SW é considerada como o limite entre o Rifte Interno e Externo sendo delimitado pela estrutura denominada de lineamento Helmut por Dehler et al 2016 Enquanto o Rifte Externo continua em processo de deformação durante o aptiano superior uma das hipóteses para os rejeitos de falhas observados na área de Iracema é a reativação das falhas do sistema do Rifte Interno durante essa movimentação do Rifte Externo Outra hipótese considerada neste estudo para a área de Iracema é a atuação da zona de transferência de Iracema Acredita se que essa zona esteja sendo afetada pelo avanço contínuo do rifte nas partes mais distais da bacia Rifte Externo e Bloco Resistente demonstrados por Rigoti 2015 o que resulta no deslocamento das falhas pré existentes da fase rifte durante a deposição dos sedimentos na seção sag na área de Iracema Essa hipótese considera a movimentação das falhas como resultado da dinâmica complexa entre o Rifte Externo e a zona de transferência de Iracema Uma terceira hipótese apresentada por Adriano et al 2022 está relacionada a uma terceira fase rifte associada às falhas de direção NW SE presentes na região de Iracema Esta terceira fase rifte é correlata a deposição do intervalo superior da Formação Barra Velha que correspondem aos intervalos sag Superior e Inferior abordados neste estudo A movimentação das falhas é o principal motivador para que seja realizada a restauração dos horizontes interpretados na sísmica A restauração estrutural confirmou a interpretação sísmica da existência do horst de Iracema durante a fase sag Os horizontes restaurados indicam a ocorrência de posições relativamente mais altas do que as observadas na sísmica em alguns setores do reservatório sugerindo a possibilidade de ocorrência de depósitos carbonáticos mais porosos A restauração estrutural também impacta positivamente na modelagem de processos modificando a expectativa de ocorrência de fácies reservatório e não reservatório Como exemplo a nordeste do poço B no modelo utilizando a superfície BVE INT restaurada existe a expectativa de uma região com boas fácies reservatórios com intercalações de arborescências calcíticas e retrabalhados Figura 20 Já na simulação utilizando o dado sísmico a região a nordeste do poço B estaria em uma posição de baixa energia Quando é analisado o dado sísmico para se avaliar qual modelo é o mais coerente são observadas feições como as demonstradas por Minzoni et al 2021 e classificadas como mounds compostos por retrabalhados e arborescências calcíticas dando robustez ao modelo construído utilizando a superfície restaurada Um importante diferencial do estudo aqui realizado foi propor a construção de mapas de paleobatimetria através de equações que correlacionam a cota dos horizontes restaurados a uma profundidade paleobatimétrica o que permite ajustar melhor as profundidades da paleobatimetria às fácies identificadas nos poços Faria et al 2017 propôs a normalização da superfície restaurada entre 0 e 60 m mas desta forma perde se a possibilidade de algum ajuste local aos dados dos poços 68 Geol USP Sér cient São Paulo v 24 n 1 p 51 72 Março 2024

Carvalho R K et al Conforme discutido por Faria et al 2017 a modelagem de processos se mostra uma ferramenta poderosa que permite analisar diversos cenários como diferentes superfícies paleobatimétrica Pode também fornecer diversas propriedades para subsidiar a modelagem probabilística de reservatórios como a proporção de fácies utilizada como trend na elaboração dos modelos de fácies que são condicionantes da distribuição de porosidade e permeabilidade no modelo 3D de reservatório CONCLUSÃO No presente trabalho foi realizada a construção do arcabouço estratigráfico e estrutural da área de Iracema campo de Tupi com o mapeamento de cinco horizontes sísmicos e 74 falhas onde foi caracterizado um horst assimétrico de direção preferencial NNW SSE que condiciona os eventos deposicionais do intervalo sag A área de Iracema está inserida no contexto tectônico do alto externo da Bacia de Santos e conforme demonstrado através da análise estrutural dos horizontes e falhas mapeadas se diferencia pela mudança de direção estrutural constatada na área com o predomínio da direção NNW SSE devido à influência da zona de transferência de Iracema que em conjunto com a direção NE SW predominante na Bacia de Santos resulta na estrutura do S de Santos Através da reconstrução estrutural foram restaurados os horizontes BVE INF e BVE INT à época da deposição dos carbonatos da fase sag validando a interpretação sísmica do horst de Iracema estruturado pelo menos desde o final da fase rifte da Formação Barra Velha É evidente a reativação de falhas associadas ao aumento de espessura dos intervalos em direção aos blocos baixos confirmando a tectônica sin deposicional nos intervalos sag inferior e sag superior na área de estudo Os mapas de paleobatimetria elaborados a partir das superfícies restauradas se mostraram preditivos demonstrando o valor de se realizar a reconstrução estrutural em áreas estruturalmente complexas Estes mapas podem ser usados tanto como input na modelagem de processos em estudos de reservatório como também diretamente na forma de um mapa de favorabilidade de fácies em estudos exploratórios expeditos O modelo de fácies resultante da modelagem de processos demonstra a variação areal e vertical das fácies controladas pela paleobatimetria e a variação do nível do lago O predomínio de fácies de alta energia no alto estrutural e em períodos de nível baixo do lago com aumento da proporção de arborescência calcítica e grainstones intercalados a níveis de fácies de baixa energia esferulitos depositadas durante os períodos de transgressão reproduziu a heterogeneidade vertical observada nos reservatórios do Pré sal O resultado obtido pode subsidiar a construção de modelos 3D de reservatórios fácies porosidade e

Wright 2022 During this stage the activity of the main rift faults ceased or decreased significantly indicating a predominantly thermal subsidence of the basin Moreira et al 2007 Lentini et al 2010 Blaich et al 2011 Buckley et al 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 The sag section is essentially formed by magnesian clays which predominate in the deeper settings and by calcite spherulites and fascicular shrubs which predominate in the shallower settings Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2008 Terra et al 2010 and Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 interpreted these carbonates as microbial de posits but they were reinterpreted by many authors as product of abiotic chemical precipitation Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Her linger et al 2017 Tosca and Wright 2018 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Lima and de Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Carvalho et al 2022 Wright 2022 Associated with these in situ deposits there are calcir udites and calcarenites of eroded and redeposited spherulitic and fascicular intraclasts

Mboe d accounting for 24 of the total Pre Salt productivity ANP 2023 According to Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 the thick car bonate packages of the Itapema and Barra Velha Formations in the Búzios Field were deposited in complex tectono stratigraphy settings with vertical and lateral facies variations indicating a heterogeneous distribution with a wide range of reservoir properties The sedimenta tion of the rift sequence was controlled by intense tectonism forming a series of horst graben and half graben structures with thickness ranging from 200 m on the structural highs to 2800 m in the structural lows The lower rift sequence Piçarras Formation was highly faulted due to a complex transfer zone while the upper rift section Itapema Formation was thinner and less affected by the tectonic activity due to the rift expansion and subsidence decrease The carbonates from the sag section Barra Velha Formation were deposited on the topography generated after the Pre Alagoas unconformity and less affected by syndepositional faulting In the Búzios Field the evaporites of the Ariri Formation are up to 2650 m thick acting as an important regional seal Their basal layer is composed of anhydrite followed by thick halite intercalated with layers of anhydrite carnallite tachyhydrite and sylvite indicative of several marine water flooding and desiccation cycles Gamboa et al

The interpreted build up and debris seismic facies commonly occur aligned with faults display higher porosity and permeability and are inferred to be the best reservoirs Castro 2019 Castro and Lupinacci 2019 and Lebre 2019 concluded that the larger presence of clays is higher in Barra Velha Formation than in Itapema Formation which would nega tively impact the reservoir quality of some of the sag rocks However the average thickness of the net pay effective reservoir of the Barra Velha Formation is approximately three times greater than that of the Itapema Formation 2 1 Búzios Field The Búzios Field located in ultra deep water 180 km off the Bra zilian coast has a total area of 850 km2 with reservoirs 5000 to 6000 m deep This supergiant Pre Salt field was discovered in 2010 and since 2015 has been breaking production records being currently the second 3 Materials and methods This petrographic study was performed over 358 thin sections from a 3

peloidal siltites constituted essen tially by peloids and ostracod bioclasts are intensely replaced by microcrystalline calcite Fig 5C Hybrid sensu Zuffa 1980 siltites with abundant peloids are lami nated Fig 5D commonly bioturbated fractured and stylolitized locally with clotted texture suggestive of microbial deposition These deposits occur at the top of the unit close to the pre Alagoas uncon formity and to the contact with the Barra Velha Formation Siliciclastic grains are in general angular to sub angular monocrystalline quartz feldspars and micas mainly muscovite Peloids and ostracod bioclasts were intensely dolomitized and recrystallized The hybrid siltites show intercalation of levels with a predominance of dolomite which contain larger amounts of siliciclastic grains or calcite which commonly show clotted texture Fig 5D The rare dolostones Fig 5E were generated by total dolomitization of the peloidal and hybrid siltites hybrid arenites and calcarenites Owing to the intense replacement by blocky dolomite the peloids appear only as ghosts within the replacive dolomite Two unusual levels of spherulitic rocks Fig 5F occur at the base and in the middle of the cored Itapema Formation section The host sediment of these rocks was essentially composed of peloids and ostracod bio clasts The peloids served as nuclei for the precipitation of spherulitic calcite These anomalous spherulstones yielded 87Sr 86Sr values of 0 7115846 and 0 7116001 δ13C values of 0 47 and 0 10 VPDB and δ18O values of 0 22 and 0 48 VPDB 4 1 Petrography of the Itapema Formation 4 1 1 Primary composition The analyzed carbonate rocks from the Itapema Formation are essentially constituted by carbonate allochems with rare siliciclastic grains quartz micas and feldspars The main allochems are bivalve and ostracod bioclasts with subordinate peloids ooids and intraclasts Table 1 Bivalve bioclasts Fig 4A are commonly disarticulated abraded and recrystallized or dissolved with the derived porosity filled with calcite cement Bivalve bioclasts also occur within intraclasts Fig 4A and ooids Ostracod bioclasts Fig 4B occur both dis articulated and articulated and are commonly associated with peloids Gastropods are rare commonly dissolved with the derived porosity filled by blocky calcite The peloids and ooids were originally composed of magnesium clays later totally replaced by microcrystalline calcite This is based on oc currences reported from other fields in Santos Basin e g Carlotto et al 2017 Chinelatto et al 2020 Leite et al 2020 and from the equivalent rift section of the Campos Basin e g Armelenti et al 2016 Goldberg et al 2017 Herlinger et al 2017 Peloids Fig 4C are very abundant predominantly with fine sand size while ooids Fig 4D show pre dominantly coarse sand size Most ooids are superficial with single thin cortical coating around the nuclei or polycomposite made by two or more ooids enveloped together The rare ooids showing radial structure were considered as originally carbonate ooliths Fig 4D Oncoids are rare showing irregular cryptocrystalline in places clotted envelopes Fig 4E generated through microbial probably cyanobacteria accretion The carbonate intraclasts are mainly peloidal Fig 4F but there are also macrocrystalline microcrystalline and spherulitic intraclasts ooidal bioclastic intraclasts and less commonly microbial intraclasts with clotted texture and originally dolomitic intraclasts The complex reworking dynamics is illustrated by the occurrence of intraclasts inside other intraclasts and of ooids with intraclastic nuclei which will be discussed ahead 4 1 3 Diagenetic constituents Calcite is the most abundant diagenetic constituent occurring as microcrystalline crystals replacing originally argillaceous peloids and ooids as blocky Fig 6A and as prismatic rims Fig 6A 6B filling and lining interparticle intraparticle and moldic porosity originated by partial or complete dissolution of bioclasts ooids and other grains Fig 6B Calcite rims were commonly detached from grain surfaces and locally engulfed by blocky calcite Calcite mosaic Fig 5B replaced bivalve bioclasts partially preserving their original structure while drusiform prismatic calcite Fig 6C and blocky calcite filled intra particle and moldic pores generated by dissolution of bivalve bioclasts Blocky dolomite also occurs filling interparticle Fig 6D intraparticle and moldic porosity Fig 6B 6C and replacing grains The dolomite rhombs commonly replaced the blocky calcite Fig 6B Microcrystalline and macrocrystalline quartz and fibrous radiated chalcedony replaced the grains partially or totally and filled the pore spaces of the hybrid arenites calcarenites and calcirudites Chalcedony rims covered the grains Fig 6E or the calcite rims Fig 6A while macrocrystalline quartz commonly filled the center of pores Fig 6E Microcrystalline quartz occurs mainly replacing ooids and peloids Fig 6E 6F while drusiform and macrocrystalline quartz replaced mainly the bivalve bioclasts Fig 6F Microcrystalline pyrite is commonly associated with the silica and dolomite In the silicified rocks pyrite occurs mainly marking the grains margins In the hybrid siltites pyrite occurs replacing the grains mainly the peloidal intraclasts and the dolomite rhombs and concentrated along stylolites Scarce pseudomatrix was locally produced by the compaction of mud intraclasts Rare macrocrystalline barite and pris matic celestite filled partially or totally the interparticle intraparticle and vugular pores 4 1 2 Lithologic types Hybrid arenites calcarenites calcirudites and peloidal siltites cf De Ros and Oliveira 2023 are the predominant rocks in the Itapema For mation These lithologic types range according to the compositional predominance and occur heterogeneously through the unit The hybrid arenites are mainly coarse rich in ooids subordinately in bivalve bio clasts peloids and peloidal intraclasts Fig 5A The bivalve bioclasts shells occur mainly within intraclasts and as nuclei in ooids Calcarenites and calcirudites composed mainly of bivalve bioclasts also known as coquinas are less common in the studied well Fig 5B The bivalve bioclasts are disarticulated often fragmented and abraded and exhibit a chaotic orientation These shells are frequently mixed with peloids Table 1 Quantitative data of main primary constituents of the Itapema Formation Primary constituents Average Maximum Ooids Peloids Oncoids Bivalve bioclasts Ostracod bioclasts Gastropod

Pray 1970 and vary according to the lithologic types Calcarenites hybrid arenites and calcirudites show mostly primary interparticle porosity and secondary intraparticle porosity from partial dissolution of mainly the ooids bivalve bioclasts and peloidal intraclasts Fig 7A The partial preservation of primary porosity is controlled mainly by the interplay between partial early cementation and compaction Moldic 5

fragmented bio clasts with intense abrasion Pettijohn 1975 De Wet et al 2002 Scholle and Ulmer Scholle 2003 Flügel 2004 Gierlowski Kordesch 2010 The rift bioclastic deposits of Campos and Santos basins were mostly interpreted as product of reworking of waves and or currents induced by storms Carvalho et al 2000 Muniz 2013 Thompson et al 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2017 2018 Mizuno et al 2018 Barnett et al 2020 Chinelatto et al 2020 Olivito and Souza 2020 Antunes 2021 However the absence of stratification and lamination i e structures typical of wave deposits the poor sorting and chaotic to concave up orientation of the bioclasts in many of the bioclastic deposits led Goldberg et al 2017 to reinterpreted most of the bioclastic rift deposits of Campos Basin as redeposited by gravity flows The same was interpreted by Harris 2000 for the equivalent rift bioclastic carbonates of the Toca Formation in the Congo Basin In addition Goldberg et al 2017 described that the Campos Basin bioclastic deposits are commonly distributed in the rift half graben lows characteristic indic ative of gravitational redeposition and show conspicuous mixing with stevensitic grains As stevensite precipitates only under highly alkaline conditions which are incompatible with the survival of bivalves this would indicate the re depositional mixing of the two constituents Armelenti et al 2016 Goldberg et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 Such gravitational redeposition makes sense within the tectonic context of the rift phase which actively controlled the depositional geometries and facies distribution Guardado et al 2000 The rift phase recurrent tectonic pulses remobilized shallow lacustrine deposits to the deeper areas Goldberg et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 considered that beyond tectonism storms and or slope destabilization would be responsible for high density bioclastic gravity flows in the Tupi Field area of Santos Basin Under such conditions the composition of the re sedimented deposits would be controlled by the tectono sedimentary dynamics and by the original composition of the marginal deposits without direct relation to the creation of accommodation space by transgressive and regressive events Goldberg et al 2017 Most likely the two models would have coexisted in the dynamic rift conditions with deposits reworked by waves and currents in shallow waters and redeposited by gravitational flows into deep settings This is considered by some authors for bioclastic deposits from the Campos Basin Mizuno et al 2018 Oliveira et al 2019 and the Santos Basin Carlotto et al 2017 Chinelatto et al 2020 Leite et al 2020 Rocha et al 2021 Carlotto et al 2017 interpreted the seismic structure of bioclastic reservoirs from the Mero Field Libra Area of the Santos Basin as mounds surrounded by progradational to chaotic wedges of deeper re sedimented deposits More recently Barnett et al 2020 concluded that the model of gravitational re sedimentation is not applicable to the Mero Field considering the scarcity of sin sedimentary deformation features and the predominance of paleocurrents parallel to the coast For those authors the mounds observed by Carlotto et al 2017 are cli noforms up to 100 m thick that represent large bars produced through the re working of the bivalves by shore parallel currents as also inter preted for Campos Basin by Olivito and Souza 2020 and not by gravitational re sedimentation The 87Sr 86Sr values 0 7115846 and 0 7116001 for two anomalous spherulitic samples collected from the Itapema Formation section of the studied well are significantly less radiogenic than those of the sag spherulstones 0 7126934 and 0 7128298 Pietzsch et al 2018 Lima et al 2020 The 87Sr 86Sr values of these two anomalous rift spherul stones correspond to those of the coquina samples characteristic of the rift interval On the other hand the δ13C and δ18O values of these samples δ13C 0 47 and 0 10 VPDB and δ18O 0 22 and 0 48 VPDB are quite similar to those of the sag Barra Velha Formation Pietzsch et al 2018 Wright 2022 Therefore even if similar precipitation conditions likely related to strong evaporative conditions occurred

al 2020 Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 As observed by Leite et al 2020 and Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 the analyzed bioclastic deposits predominantly show features indicative of reworking These include the abrasion fragmentation and disarticulation of the bivalve bioclasts Fig 4A and their occurrence within intraclasts Rocha et al 2021 Barnett et al 2020 and as nuclei in ooids Fig 4 A 13A Another feature indicative of redeposition is the common mixing of bivalve bioclasts with peloids ooids and intraclasts originally constituted of stevensite or other Mg clays Fig 4A 5A 5B as the latter are formed in highly alkaline environments incompatible with the survival of bivalves Goldberg et al 2017 Furthermore the occurrences of intraclasts within other intraclasts of ooids with intra clastic nuclei and of ooids within intraclasts corroborate the complex dynamic multicyclic reworking Fig 13 The siliciclastic grains of quartz feldspars and micas and the vol canic fragments described

mixing by storm waves and currents close to the lacustrine rift margins Carvalho et al 2000 Mizuno et al 2018 Muniz and Bosence 2018 Siliciclastic grains are absent or very rare in the analyzed

al 2018 Wright 2022 The dry climate promoted intense evaporation of the lake waters what combined with the volcanic basement and the coeval magmatism and hydrothermalism resulted in an extensive alkaline system although without large scale desiccation and exposure Pietzsch et al 2018 2020 Wright 2022 On the other hand the suggestion of a system consisting of small isolated lakes with only episodic lateral connection and extensive exposed areas as proposed e g by Arienti et al 2018 and Farias et al 2019 is contradicted by the lateral continuity of the seismic reflectors and stratigraphic units Wright and Barnett 2017 and by the occur rence of the same facies and δ13C and δ18O values in the Santos Campos and Kwanza basins Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Pietzsch et al 2020 The limited variation of the δ13C and δ18O values of the in situ samples analyzed in the studied well δ13C ranging between 1 06 and 2 81 VPDB and δ18O between 0 74 and 0 19 VPDB are compatible with the values reported in the literature for the sag carbonates Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima et al 2020 Pietzsch et al 2020 and indicate a closed and relatively large lacustrine system Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Pietzsch et al 2018 2020 Such system would have involved equilibration between the lake water and the atmosphere through CO2 degassing as well as significant evapora tion Pietzsch et al 2020 Together with these aspects there is a lack of features characteristic of exposure within the sag interval Such aspects should include calcretes and dolocretes with meteoric δ18O values vadose pendular and meniscus cements oxidation and clay cutans cf Esteban and Klappa 1983 Railsback et al 2012 Additionally the original stevensite matrix is commonly preserved while the subaerial exposure of stevensite would extensively promote its alteration to sepiolite cf Chahi et al 1997 Pozo and Calvo 2018 All these aspects indicate that the pre salt sag constituted a single vast lacustrine system rather than multiple small lakes A microbial origin has been proposed by some authors for the characteristic in situ deposits made of calcite fascicular shrubs and

al 2022 However the fibrous fabric and the stable isotope composition of the calcite shrubs and spherulites indicate that they are a product of abiotic chemical precipitation Wright and Barnett 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Wright and Barnett 2020 Wright 2022 Their δ13C and δ18O values indicate a relative equilibrium between atmospheric and lake water CO2 Pietzsch et al 2020 The deposition of lacustrine carbonate facies of the sag was prefer entially developed on structural highs remaining from the erosion along the Pre Alagoas unconformity as in the Tupi Field Carvalho et al 2022 Sommer et al 2022 or created by reactivation of the rift system faults what apparently was the case in the Búzios Field Ferreira et al 2019a Macedo et al 2021b Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 Some of the reactivated faults apparently controlled the genesis of car bonate mounds interpreted in the seismic lines as well as the hydro thermal alteration of some Pre Salt reservoirs Lima et al 2020 Hunt 2021 Mendes et al 2022 The mound aspect of sag carbonate structures seen in the Pre Salt seismic lines e g Minzoni et al 2020 and the shrub morphology characteristic of the in situ deposits has conducted some authors e g Terra et al 2010 Boyd et al 2015 Virgone et al 2021 Erthal et al 2022 to interpret part of the deposits as travertines However the fast complex facies variations away from the spring conduits and the frac tionated stable isotopes values characteristic of subaerial travertines e g Gandin and Capezzuoli 2008 Fouke 2011 are absent from the Pre Salt deposits as are also absent subaerial exposure features Some of the mounds may have been produced by sub lacustrine travertine sys tems Della Porta 2015 However the morphological and isotopic as pects of the fascicular shrub deposits of these mounds are identical to those of the shrubstones distributed widely and away from the mounds Rodríguez Berriguete et al 2022 examined specifically the potential analogies of the Pre Salt shrub deposits with travertines observing that they totally differ in the lateral and vertical facies changes in saturation 16

S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 conditions and flow energy They concluded that travertines are not a good analogue for Pre Salt reservoir geometry and facies distribution although potentially providing clues on how the shrubs were precipi tated Therefore the characterization of some of the seismically iden tified mounds as sublacustrine travertines requires further investigation Evaluating the origin of the intraclastic deposits from the Barra Velha Formation Barnett et al 2018 2021 defined two distinct depositional configurations for the extensive and continuous packages of intraclastic rudstones and grainstones that appear intercalated with the in situ shrub and spherulite deposits of the Barra Velha Formation The first would be characterized by well sorted sharp based fining up packages with mainly planar low angle stratification locally planar cross lamination deposited along the escarpment and dip slope of fault blocks and interpreted as carbonate fan delta shorelines with wave reworked sheet flood or terminal splay deposits as also interpreted by Wright 2022 The second would be defined by coarser immature and thick packages adjacent to narrow and elongated mounds located along faulted blocks margins interpreted as formed by the subaerial disaggregation of mounds composed mainly of shrubs However Wright and Rodriguez 2018 argued that the seismic lines presented by Barnett et al 2018 fail to meet the Burgess et al 2013 criteria for identifying carbonate buildups which include for example high angle margins reflector thickening and increase in steepness seismic facies differentiation onlap fracturing and collapse truncation of reflectors by karst among others Wright and Rodriguez 2018 commented additionally that the seismic facies showing apparent cli noform features can be attributed either to seismic effects of the over lying evaporites or to post depositional tectonics A particularly important aspect of the Pre Salt intraclastic facies is their frequent occurrence over highs in diverse areas where the shrubstones were also deposited This seems to occur for instance in the Tupi Field Carvalho et al 2022 Sommer et al 2022 in the Búzios Field Ferreira et al 2021a 2021b Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 in other areas of the Santos Basin Camargo et al 2022 Rebelo et al 2022 and in the Kwanza Basin Saller et al 2016 This distri bution is not compatible with a gravitational model for these occurrences Centimetric intercalations between intraclastic and in situ deposits are very frequent in the analyzed well The same was observed by Azere do et al 2021 Carvalho et al 2022 and Rodríguez Berriguete et al 2022 indicating rapid changes in the hydrodynamic conditions Along the well the high frequency intercalation of in situ and reworked deposits occurs even at a thin section scale Fig 14 The intercalation of intraclastic and in situ deposits is observed both by the recurrent erosion Fig 14 Examples of intercalations of chemical in situ and hydrodynamic intraclastic deposits observed at thin section scale indicative of a dynamic depositional process changes A and B Calcarenite composed of spherulitic and fascicular intraclasts covered by spherulstone P and XP C and D Coalesced intensely recrystallized shrubstone overlain by calcarenite composed of spherulitic and fascicular intraclasts P and XP E and F Shrubs engulfing ooids and intra clasts XP 17

S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 and redeposition of shrubs and spherulites and by the encrustation of intraclasts and ooids by fascicular calcite Fig 14 Frequently this alternation occurs as millimeter thin layers Furthermore the intraclasts typically exhibit a rounded to sub rounded shape and show a moderate to good sorting This distribution and textural characteristics are un likely to result from gravitational redeposition Gravitational deposits formed through slope redeposition of shallow water carbonate sedi ments typically exhibit restricted spatial distribution and strong lateral grain size variations Playton et al 2010 These patterns contrast with the commonly widespread distribution and good selection of most redeposited Pre Salt facies Nevertheless subaqueous gravitational redeposition remains a viable mechanism for some intraclastic deposits close to the Pre Salt mounds characterized by poor sorting and coarse grain size Fig 15A The importance and extension of this process was probably limited by the absence of sub aerial exposure and the limited syndepositional tectonism in the succession The interlayering between fascicular calcite and intraclastic deposits was interpreted by Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 and Carvalho et al 2022 as product of the activity of waves and currents based on observed sedimentary structures indicative of tractive processes such as low angle cross stratification wave ripples and hummocky cross stratification The same was interpreted by Saller et al 2016 for the intraclastic deposits of the Kwanza Basin However such structures are not observed in the analyzed reworked rocks which are predomi nantly massive Wave reworking remains nevertheless a viable rede position process in a huge lacustrine system such as the interpreted South Atlantic Pre Salt sag Fig 15B Another mechanism that could have promoted the observed subtle and recurrent re deposition would be internal waves Ba denas et al 2012 Pomar et al 2012 Morsilli and Pomar 2012 Internal waves are generated by hydrostatic perturbation of the interface chemocline between a less dense upper level epilimnion and a lower denser hy polimnion water in stratified meromictic saline lakes Munk 1981 Apel 2002 or restrict marine gulfs or lagoons In stratified water bodies perturbations in the chemocline are common and may be pro moted by superficial currents and or waves wind stress fluctuations subaqueous slides or by tectonic activity Pomar et al 2012 Internal waves have lower frequency and larger amplitude than surface waves The breaking of internal waves occurs where the chemocline intersects the bottom leading to episodic reworking and transport of sediments Pomar et al 2012 Pomar and Haq 2016 According to Pomar et al 2012 these deposits can be concentrated in discrete intervals There fore internal waves would provide a viable mechanism for the genera tion of thin intraclastic levels and their high frequency intercalation with in situ deposits Fig 15C As previously discussed such high frequency changes in the depo sitional conditions cannot be attributed to lake level variations as proposed by e g Gomes et al 2020 Pietzsch et al 2020 Azere do et al 2021 Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Wright 2022 Tonietto et al 2023 and Rodríguez Berriguete et al 2022 considering the huge dimensions and the lack of evidence of subaerial exposure of the Pre Salt lacustrine system Fluctuations in the lake level are typically regarded as the main factor contributing to changes in the water chemistry of most lacustrine systems However the recurrent and high frequency variations in the chemical composition and depositional en ergy of the very large alkaline Pre Salt lacustrine system cannot be attributed to this mechanism For this system a scenario with a near constant lake level where the variations arise from oscillations within a stratified system would be more suitable Another significant observation within the reworked deposits in volves the occurrence of multicycle redeposition Fig 16 There are ooids within intraclasts intraclasts within ooids and intraclasts within intraclasts This occurrence of multiple cycles within the same grain is indicating a dynamic environment characterized by frequent fluctua tions in the hydrodynamic conditions as suggested by Carramal et al 2022 This could be better explained by the perturbations caused by internal waves Fig 15C leading to recurrent reworking The observed Barra Velha Formation ooids are primarily constituted by thin commonly single clay envelopes around intraclastic nuclei Fig 8E 14B as reported by Carramal et al 2022 for the Tupi Field area This contrasts with the rift section ooids which present thicker envelopes around siliciclastic volcanoclastic or bioclastic nuclei Ber tani and Carozzi 1985 Rehim et al 1986 Armelenti et al 2016 Goldberg et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 Although ooids are generally associated with relatively high energy conditions these superficial ooids may have been formed in relatively lower energy conditions than in the rift interval through heterogeneous precipitation over their larger intraclastic nuclei Frequently the observed superficial ooids occur as discrete levels Fig 14 A and B intercalated with in situ levels The sag ooids show signs of reworking during further redeposition events Car ramal et al 2022 represented by abraded margins and partial pres ervation of the envelopes mostly on the concave portions of the grains surfaces Such recurrent reworking of calcite intraclasts as nuclei of clay ooids later reworked might be attributed to frequent hydrodynamic perturbations recurrently eroding and redepositing the grains Fig 15C The clay peloids may have been deposited in intermediate energy conditions between those of the ooids and the laminated Mg clay deposits characteristic of the sag Armelenti et al 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 Part of the peloids may have been formed by flocculation due the salinity variations Carramal et al 2022 Some of these particles may be associated with the reworking of the previously deposited laminated clays 6 Conclusions The systematic petrographic analysis of the intraclastic deposits from the rift Itapema and sag Barra Velha Formation within a Búzios Field well exhibited the complex nature of the reworked pre salt deposits Observations regarding textures and primary constituents were compared with those described in the proposed published in order to understand the depositional processes and environments In the Itapema Formation bioclastic deposits predominantly show features indicative of reworking as abrasion fragmentation and disarticulation of the bivalve bioclasts and their occurrence within intraclasts and as nuclei of ooids The complexity of the particles points to a dynamic and multicyclic reworking The distribution in lows chaotic orientation and the common mixing of bivalve bio clasts with peloids intraclasts and ooids originally constituted of stevensite or other Mg clays indicates gravitational redeposition Nevertheless features indicative of waves and currents observed in other pre salt areas suggest that both gravitational and wave and or current driven reworking processes likely coexisted Conversely the intraclastic deposits of the Barra Velha Formation consist of intraclasts eroded from in situ spherulitic and fascicular shrub deposits These reworked deposits showing features of multi cycle redeposition and are widely distributed and often intercalated with in situ deposits throughout the sag interval Considering this the two models proposed in the literature to explain the formation of these deposits are controversial The lack of subaerial exposure features good sorting and occurrence on structural highs of many sag intraclastic deposits seem to exclude a gravitational redeposition model Likewise the lack of structures indicative of traction processes such as low angle and hummocky cross stratification current and wave ripples do not support an interpretation of reworking by waves and currents for most examined reworked rocks which exhibit a pre dominantly massive structure Internal waves generated through perturbation of the chemocline in the large stratified meromictic alkaline lacustrine system may have been responsible for the subtle and recurrent observed re deposition 18

salt oil ﬁelds in the Santos and Campos Basins diﬀer in a number of important aspects from classic lake deposits Prior work has described distinctive and unusual features of deposition early diagenesis and reservoir quality with in these rocks that defy classiﬁcation using established schemes In addition to their unusual textures debate continues as to how to interpret the vertical stacking pattern of facies A new facies classiﬁcation scheme is proposed based on the relative abundance of three endmember components mud micrite and clay minerals calcite spherulites and fascicular calcite shrubs Although focused on the main textural and mineralogical features of the rocks as seen today the proposed scheme takes into account the relative contribution of depositional and early diagenetic components sediment mineralogy and the degree of dissolution Application of this scheme oﬀers insight into depositional conditions whilst also linking to reservoir quality Basic elementary cycles can be deﬁned using this classiﬁcation in combination with the variation in the abundance of detrital grains and the chemical composition Three possible models are suggested to interpret the origin of the basic cycle within the Barra Velha Formation in the context of variation in climate lake level and water chemistry Integration of data from diﬀerent sources including petrographic core

limestones into four main categories grainstone packstone wackestone and mudstone with boundstone for reefal and microbial limestones To recognize particular types of boundstone within reefal rocks Embry and Klovan 1971 suggested the terms framestone bafﬂestone and boundstone Similarly Riding 2000 recognized four types of microbialite stromatolite thrombolite dendrite and leiolite For a limestone dominated by a cement Wright 1992 proposed the term cementstone Some of these classiﬁcations originally conceptualized for marine carbonates have been used for lacustrine deposits with some modiﬁcations and variable degrees of success Walker 1992 However the lacustrine carbonate rocks of the giant Pre salt oil ﬁelds in the Santos and Campos Basins oﬀshore Brazil diﬀer in a number of

Marine and Petroleum Geology 113 2020 104176 J P Gomes et al 2 Geological setting aspects from classic well documented carbonate lake deposits 1 The conﬁguration of Cretaceous horsts and grabens generated many islands surrounded by an extensive lake or many small lakes with variable connectivity through time Pietzsch et al 2018 2 The siliciclastic lake shoreline is located far to the west from the areas of hydrocarbon exploration interest Dias 2005 3 Carbonate deposits appear to be laterally continuous over tens of kilometres Carminatti et al 2008 4 The carbonates are comprised of three main components and detrital material derived from them shrubs millimetre scale ﬁbrous laminae and spherulites Wright and Barnett 2015 Published articles describing these Pre salt deposits have tried to ﬁt them within pre existing facies schemes Wright and Barnett 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Wright and Barnett 2017 Herlinger et al 2017 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Arienti et al 2018 Artagão 2018 Sartorato 2018 Farias et al 2019 Tanaka et al 2018 Lima and De Ros 2019 Wright and Barnett 2019 However this has given rise to a confusing range of terms to describe a single rock fabric For example a rock composed of shrub like calcite crystals has been classiﬁed variously as a stromatolite and a thrombolite Terra et al 2010 Muniz and Bosence 2015 as fascicular calcite crust Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 or as in situ shrubs Wright and Barnett 2015 or shrub like facies Farias et al 2019 Similarly rocks composed of spherulites have been classiﬁed as spherulite dominated lithologies Wright and Barnett 2015 as Mg clay with spherulites facies and spherulitite Farias et al 2019 and as stevensitic claystones with calcite spherulites Lima and De Ros 2019 In contrast the abundant ﬁne grained facies are widely described as laminites Lima and De Ros 2019 Muniz and Bosence 2015 There has been considerable discussion about the way in which established terminology to describe facies can best be applied in a Pre salt context In many cases these terms are associated with distinct paleoenvironmental conditions and or formation processes There is a clear need for a facies classiﬁcation scheme based on the proportion of components that characterizes the lacustrine sediments of the Pre salt and that is distinct from a process based classiﬁcation and thus can help evaluate alternative models of formation Any such scheme should also allow evaluation of the variability of these components on a micro and macroscale in order to understand variations through the stratigraphic succession and to allow a proper facies upscaling Our objective in this paper is to propose a new facies classiﬁcation scheme in order to document in a more meaningful manner the vertical trends in sediment texture and composition for the lacustrine carbonates of the Pre salt Barra Velha Formation in our area of study of the Santos Basin Fig 1 This is based on the textural and mineralogical features of the rocks as seen today and considers the relative abundance of the three end member components that are formed in situ mud dolomite calcite silica and Mg clay calcite spherulites and fascicular calcite shrubs In addition the proposed scheme takes into account the relative contribution of depositional and early diagenetic components sediment mineralogy and the degree of dissolution as well as any reworking of in situ sediment Although developed for the database of Barra Velha Formation we believe this scheme may have wider application in supporting systematic and consistent descriptions and interpretations of deposits from both Barra Velha Formation from other pre salt areas and a range of comparable alkaline lake systems with similar facies It is worth to mention that our area of study does not include all facies described in other areas such as the microbial siliciﬁed boundstone in Kwanza Basin Saller et al 2016 As an example of the application of the new facies scheme the occurrence of the various facies types is combined with the abundance of detrital grains and trace element variations to characterize metre scale ideal cycles within the Barra Velha succession and to propose alternative process based models of changes in the environment of deposition The southern domain of the South Atlantic is composed of a number of extensive basins which include the Santos and Campos basins oﬀshore Brazil Fig 1A and the Kwanza and Namibe basins oﬀshore southwest Africa These have been interpreted as resulting from two phases of extension during the pre rift stage of South Atlantic opening in the Late Hauterivian Early Barremian The succeeding rift phase in the later Barremian Aptian lasted 5 6 My and was characterized by tilting of fault blocks and growth strata in upper continental crust followed by the development of a ﬂexural and continuous sag basin Chaboureau et al 2013 The Santos Basin is located on the southeastern Brazilian margin between the Campos Basin in the north and the Pelotas Basin in the south east of the Brazilian states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro Fig 1B It is one of the most extensive oﬀshore brazilian basins with an area of 352 000 km2 and a current water depth of up to 3 000 m The main structural features are the Cabo Frio High to the northeast the Florianópolis Platform to the southwest the Santos hinge line to the west which marks the external western limit of the salt Ariri Formation and the São Paulo plateau to the east Our area of interest is located in region of the Santos Outer High in the central part of the Santos Basin Fig 1C Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 performed a restoration from balanced cross sections and concluded that this area of the Santos basin did not undergo structure inversion which implies the actual structure high was also a palaeohigh throughout Barra Velha deposition The basement of the Santos Basin is composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks Tholeiitic ﬂood basalt formed during the early stages of rifting in the Lower Cretaceous Camburiú Formation is the equivalent of the Cabiúnas Formation in the Campos Basin and it has been dated to 134 122 Ma Mizusaki et al 1992 The sediments of the Santos Basin Fig 2 are divided into three super sequences rift postrift and drift Moreira et al 2007 The rift super sequence is composed of continental siliciclastics talc stevensite ooids with interbedded lacustrine coquinas and organic rich shales of the Piçarras and Itapema formations This was followed by a post rift super sequence comprising lacustrine carbonates and shales of the Barra Velha Formation which is followed by evaporitic deposits of anhydride and halite locally with more soluble salts such as carnallite sylvite and tachyhydrite forming the Ariri Formation Three major unconformities are important for understanding the Barra Velha Formation the basal Pre Alagoas Unconformity PAU at the top of the coquina deposits an internal unconformity called the Intra Alagoas Unconformity IAU and the Salt Base Unconformity SBU that caps the formation Fig 2 Finally the basin evolved into a passive margin basin with an early drift supersequence represented by shallow marine platform carbonates of the Guarujá Formation followed by platform drowning and deeper water sediments of the Itanhaém Formation High frequency basic ideal or elementary cycles consisting of a regular repetition of facies have been recognized in these lacustrine carbonates in the Santos and Campos basins Dias 2005 Wright and Barnett 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Arienti et al 2018 Artagão 2018 Sartorato 2018 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 The basic cycles are represented as having a thickness of 1 2 m although examples range from 0 75 to 5 m These cycles typically are comprised of mud grade laminated carbonates followed by units containing millimetre diameter spherulites and ﬁnally units dominated by millimetre centimetre calcitic crystal shrubs Wright and Barnett 2015 These authors interpreted mudstone claystone laminite facies to have formed in the relatively deep water part of the lake The shrubs formed on the ﬂoor of the lake in many cases followed by subaerial exposure and the generation of breccias suggesting deposition in shallow water or during a period of shallowing Whilst there is general agreement over the character of the proposed cycles there is still intense debate about many aspects of these Barra Velha sediments These include the biological or abiotic 2

Marine and Petroleum Geology 113 2020 104176 J P Gomes et al particles Fig 5 The main clay minerals present in the Barra Velha Formation are kerolite stevensite saponite sepiolite illite and mixedlayer minerals kerolite smectite and illite smectite Souza et al 2018 Madrucci et al 2019 Spherulites The spherulites are spherical to sub spherical calcite aggregates with radial extinction that commonly are dolomitized or recrystallized Spherulites from ten thin sections were measured and range in diameter from 0 1 mm to 4 mm with a mean of 1 mm 0 3 standard deviation n 800 and a mode of 0 6 mm Figs 6c h and 7 The low variance in their size distribution suggests the same process of formation for all spherulites A notable exception is the small number of samples n 3 that show normal or inverse grading at the thin section scale suggesting a relationship between spherulite size and an ideal combination of water chemistry and hydrodynamic conditions In some cases it is possible to recognize nuclei composed of cryptocrystalline micrite clay minerals and more rarely a fragment of ostracod The calcitic ﬁbro radial texture is preserved in most of the samples but chalcedonic and micro quartz replacement locally results in the loss of original fabric Some spherulites are asymmetric with preferential growth in one particular direction In most cases spherulites tend to grow upwards whereas in some layers the spherulites grow parallel to the bedding Some grains are a mixture of a fascicular component similar to a shrub and yet show a ﬁbro radial texture characteristic of a spherulite In these situations the volumetrically dominant of the two textures is used to determine the component name Shrubs The term shrub is applied in this study to the ray crystal crust deﬁned by Folk et al 1985 emphasizing the morphological similarity to fascicular optic calcite sensu Kendall 1977 with a divergent optic axis pattern within each crystal away from the substrate Shrubs are composed of ﬁbrous to extremely coarse bladed calcite crystals with the long axis of their fan shaped structure ranging from 0 15 to 6 5 mm in length Some shrubs incorporate random ﬁne detrital grains or rarely bioclasts within their structure Within an individual layer shrubs are oriented parallel to one another varying from densely packed 0 2 mm between shrub central axes to widely spaced 4 mm spacing Fig 6 a and b In some samples it is possible to identify more than one growth phase resulting in a composite shrub that extends up to 20 mm The shrubs occur predominantly as horizontal layers and locally form low domal structures Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 Rezende and Pope 2015 the facies from Formation Image Logs FMI Log for the intervals without cores was applied create a qualitative facies log based on the sidewall core facies and diﬀerences in image texture Wireline logs gamma ray especially and thin sections from sidewall core samples were used as additional data in order to determine and interpret the facies Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANning electron microscopy QEMSCAN and X Ray Diﬀraction XRD data were also obtained for diﬀerent facies Chemical and mineralogical maps of 10 representative thin sections were produced using a QEMSCAN 650 automated mineralogical mapping instrument with accelerating voltage of 15 kV and 10 μm spot size The mineralogical maps show the spatial distribution of mineral phases and the relationship between them their abundance was quantiﬁed as area percentages or percentage of mass considering the theoretical density of minerals Quantities lower than 0 01 were ignored Chemical analysis was performed on 590 samples from Well 3 core samples using ICP OES Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry in order to determine the elemental abundance of Al2O3 Fe2O3 CaO Cr2O3 K2O MgO MnO Na2O SiO2 and TiO2 Most analytical chemical data are of a closed form where individual components are summed yielding an identical total As result as some elements increase in relative abundance others must decrease This aspect leads to correlation measures and graphical presentations that do not reﬂect the true underlying relationships This constraint can be corrected before multivariate statistical analysis by making a centred log ratio transformation CLR as described by Montero Serrano et al 2010 The chemical data after CLR and the detrital grain abundance from XRD data were interpreted using Principal Component Analysis PCA to understand the correlation between these variables Finally vertical variations in facies detrital content and elemental composition were used qualitatively to identify the basic cycles 4 Facies classiﬁcation The Barra Velha facies samples from the eight wells are dominated by variable amounts of three components that were formed in situ mud understood as ﬁne grained components microcrystalline calcite and clay minerals calcite spherulites and fascicular optic calcite shrubs These have been described in previous studies of Pre salt carbonates in the Santos and Campos basins as well as from the Namibian and Kwanza basins However there is a lack of consensus as to the processes responsible for formation of some of these components Here we describe the main component grains in our study area and propose a new facies classiﬁcation 4 2 Facies classiﬁcation The triangular diagram Fig 8 shows the proposed classiﬁcation that encapsulates the range of combinations of the three main components where there is no evidence of signiﬁcant reworking The most abundant component gives a rock name and the secondary component provides a qualifying adjective Figs 4 6 show thin section examples of each facies type deﬁned In addition an adjective for the main diagenetic event can be added for example dolomitic spherulitestone Fig 6 g and h siliciﬁed spherulitestone or dissolved spherulitestone In order to provide suﬃcient categories to diﬀerentiate rocks of signiﬁcantly diﬀerent composition the classiﬁcation triangle for in situ deposits Fig 8 is subdivided into nine rock types The percentage values selected for the boundaries are those that provide a convenient separation of common combinations described in cores and thin sections In the classiﬁcation of an essentially continuous series all divisions are arbitrary Folk 1959 The boundaries used in the proposed classiﬁcation unavoidably reﬂect personal opinion but it is suggested they coincide with a separation of components formed by diﬀerent processes The in situ carbonates comprising more than 90 of shrubs spherulites or mud rich end members are designated shrubstone spherulitestone and mudstone respectively Fig 8 The combination of more than 50 shrubs and less than 10 mud separates spherulitic shrubstone from shrubby spherulitestone Rocks with more than 10 4 1 Description of main components Mud The ﬁne grained material in the Pre salt carbonates as matrix between grains and as beds is broadly referred to as mud This includes that comprised of clay minerals calcite dolomite and silica Petrographically the clays occur as optically clear grains of clay aggregates usually within beds which are massive or have a ﬁne millimetric scale lamination examples of these are shown in Fig 4 The clay minerals may show a degree of replacement by microcrystalline dolomite and microcrystalline silica In other cases the ﬁne grained sediment is micrite which is mostly composed of calcite but may show a degree of replacement by dolomite and silica Some of the dolomite silica could be primary but likely formed via a metastable precursor In general the light cream to dark brown coloured sediments show a plane parallel to smooth wavy lamination with thicknesses varying from millimetres to centimetres examples of these are shown in Fig 5 Optical microscopy shows that the light laminae are composed of microcrystalline calcite and the dark bands are composed of microcrystalline and rhombohedral dolomite and organic matter Some mud samples contain ﬁne siliciclastic grains ostracods and phosphatic 5

Marine and Petroleum Geology 113 2020 104176 J P Gomes et al Fig 13 Distribution of elemental geochemistry Box a and b are detailed in Figs 14 and 19 The question of the role of biological factors in the initiation of calcite shrub precipitation or even to facilitate carbonate nucleation remains open Ceraldi and Green 2017 suggested that shrubs are a microbial inﬂuenced facies and may represent shallow water deposition aﬀected by wave base and potentially also the depth of the photic zone This interpretation is supported by observations in the Kwanza basin Saller et al 2016 where the shrubs are interpreted to form positive topographic structures similar to biotic reefs in which growth is oriented towards the light Alternatively Farias et al 2019 proposed a depositional model for the Barra Velha Formation invoking similar processes to those in an evaporative basin based on criteria used by Lowenstein and Hardie 1985 in modern salt pans The proposed model proposes an alternation of periods of ﬂooding which transforms the salt pan temporarily into a brackish lake and subsequent periods when the basin is solely groundwater fed and evaporative concentration leads to desiccation The alternating layers of shrub spherulite and mud in the BVF are proposed by Farias et al 2019 to be the equivalent of alternating halite and mud layers that characterize salt pan deposits The shrubs are thus interpreted to have been generated at the sediment water interface during evaporative periods implying that shrub formation reﬂects climatically control lake level oscillations Calcitic spherulites are interpreted to form diagenetically within a Mg clay below the saline pans nuclei for spherulite growth meaning that spherulite formation was initiated by microbial activity but that the crystal growth itself is abiotic Shrubs Shrubs are interpreted in this study to have formed by insitu growth upward from a substrate suggesting a higher rate of precipitation at sites near the top of the shrubby layer where the advective supply of reactive ions is greater than closer to the substrate Terra et al 2010 suggested adopting the term stromatolite sensu Riding 2000 They described laminated deposits comprising layers of individual shrubs which branch as they grow upwards forming convex structures However many authors Wright and Barnett 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 Souza et al 2018 Lima and De Ros 2019 Farias et al 2019 described these deposits as some type of abiotic carbonate with morphometric similarities suggesting controlling processes comparable to those in travertine systems These authors however noted the lack of features typical of travertine such as cascades pisoids ﬂow carbonates vents and gas bubble spheres Farias et al 2019 Our observations accord with those of previous studies suggesting rapid precipitation from highly saturated solutions Wright and Barnett 2015 changes in the lake water chemistry related to climate abiotic precipitation related to CO2 loss by evaporation magmatic CO2 input and hydrothermal activity Lima and De Ros 2019 This would thus support the conclusion that the use of the term stromatolite is inappropriate 13
