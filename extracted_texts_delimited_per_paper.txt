Formation carbonates Santos Basin Brazil Depositional facies Diagenetic facies Palaeoenvironment Reservoir facies quality The Santos Basin in offshore Brazil belongs to the major carbonate reservoir province known informally as the Pre-Salt A detailed analysis of cores plugs sidewall samples and thin-sections from two wells in a sector of this basin was undertaken on an interval corresponding to the upper part of the Lower Cretaceous Barra Velha Formation Several facies and subfacies types have been classified independently from existing terminologies for these carbonate rocks The specific features of the studied material are discussed and comparison to other no menclatures is made The facies include namely laminated argillaceous limestones in-situ grown carbonates with a range of singular morphologies of debatable origin from laminar crust stromatolitic-like fabric to robust or delicate shrubby structures intraclastic grainstones packstones whose clasts may be mostly remnants of shrubs or differ spherulitic grainstones packstones locally oncoidal grainstones rudstones and packstones floatstones These rocks are interpreted as depositional and diagenetic or essentially diagenetic facies The latter are regarded as originally similar to some of the former ones but now disguised because they were differently impacted by diagenesis processes over different time periods Recognizing these effects is relevant because they produce different reservoir facies characteristics and quality The best potential reservoirs are some of the depositional and the mostly diagenetic facies The palaeoenvironmental setting of the studied facies fits into a shallow low-gradient lake Charophyte and other possible unidentified algae albeit extremely rare are documented for the first time The facies pattern shows some cyclicity suggestive of both water depth and chemistry changes If the interpretations in this study are correct they i reinforce existing datasets to improve understanding of these facies ii raise caution concerning some facies previously considered as separate depositional products which in fact may instead result from diagenetic modifications iii stress the relevance of microfacies analysis and diagenetic petrography to help deciphering how diagenetic modifications impact on reservoir facies prop erties and quality and iv add new issues to the naming and textural classification problems of the Brazil PreSalt carbonates 1 Introduction The Pre-Salt Lower Cretaceous succession of the South Atlantic Margin offshore Brazil hosts major hydrocarbon reserves The giant carbonate reservoirs of these hydrocarbon habitats are one of the most important discoveries of recent times due to their exceptional econom ical value e g Carminatti et al 2008 Carlotto et al 2017 but besides its oil hosting importance have given birth to completely new perspectives because of their extraordinary sedimentary nature and characteristics As a result they have caused a huge scientific impact on carbonate sedimentology In spite of the largely accepted overall depositional setting of non-marine alkaline lacustrine conditions of these carbonate facies the singularity and unknown nature of a range of textures structures and morphologies raised a whole new world of scientific questions still under intense discussion e g Wright 2011 2012 Dorobek et al

Ceraldi and Green 2017 Wright and Rodr guez 2018 Pietzsch et al 2018 Farias et al 2019 Gomes et al 2020 The uncertainties and conflicting theories root in the strong differences of the Pre-Salt carbonates from the previously known geological record and related environmental scenarios and in the fact that their partial morphological resemblance with a few types of car bonate deposits like travertines tuffs and microbialites is not accom panied by unequivocal evidence of their genetic nature and processes The main points of doubt and debate are related with i biotic mi crobial versus abiotic genesis of the carbonates ii type of lake settings topographic-bathymetric configuration hydro-geochemistry and palaeohydrology and their evolution over time iii carbonate rock classification and terminology iv genesis and significance of specific features namely the spherulites and the Mg-rich clays that occur asso ciated with the carbonates The Pre-Salt sequences from the African conjugate margin namely in the offshore Kwanza Basin of Angola have also recently been addressed in search for answers to some of these topics e g Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2017 Teboul et al 2017 Due to confidentiality restrictions until recently most of the pub lished information on the Brazil Pre-Salt namely from Santos and Campos basins Fig 1 was almost only limited to conference pro

Seismic characterization Tectonic evolution Rift basins Santos basin B zios field The B zios Field is one of the most prolific petroleum fields along the Eastern Brazilian Margin Despite sig nificant research conducted restrictedly on the pre-salt reservoirs few studies have focused on the threedimensional characterization of the entire B zios Field area Therefore this work aims to spatially characterize a volume along the B zios Field area using 3D seismic volume interpretation seismic attributes and well-log data The combined use of these tools allowed the understanding of several parameters concerning the tecto nostratigraphic evolution of the Santos Basin Within the mapped area we identified five units Syn-Rift I SynRift II Post-Rift I Post-Rift II Drift I and Drift II The 3D model reveals significant features such as the depth variation of the Syn-Rift I unit and the heterogeneous morphology of the Post-Rift II unit The Syn-Rift I unit is deeper towards the N-NW and shallower towards the S-SE due to a regional half-grabens system This system impacts the pre-salt geometry and thickness as structural highs and lows are relevant factors in sediment ac commodation The Post-Rift I unit has a predominantly regular geometry and thickness but tends to thicken towards the S-SE and exhibits slight downward flexure towards the NE in the southeast of the B zios Field In three dimensions the heterogeneous morphology of the Post-Rift II unit is evidenced by the variable thickness and irregular topography accounting for the intense halokinesis in the Santos Basin Above the evaporite layer the thickness of the Drift I unit is highly conditioned by salt morphology with thicker and deformed packages in areas of thinner salt section On the other hand the Drift II unit shows relatively constant thickness with minor variations near fault zones Comparisons with other fields within the Santos Basin Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa reveal differences in layer thickness mobilization and rotation of the syn-rift blocks The Post-Rift I layer Barra Velha Fm and the Post-Rift II package Ariri Fm are thinner and less mobilized in the B zios Field area Moreover the syn-rift blocks are less rotated and the internal reflectors have a lower inclination in the study area when compared to these other fields Therefore this research concludes that the lower mobilization of salt the lower thickness of the post-rift package and the minor syn-rift block rotation observed in the B zios Field area are associated with the relative distance from the continental margin and consequently with the amount of displacement generated by the South Atlantic Rift In this case the B zios Field is located in a more proximal portion than the Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields exhibiting features suggestive of a lower displacement 1 Introduction The exploration of petroleum in the eastern Brazilian margin basins has gained great expression over the last 50 years especially after the start of hydrocarbon production in the Campos Basin in the late 1970s Pereira and Macedo 1990 In the 1970s some projects led to a systematic investigation of the offshore sedimentary basins using geophysical data The interpretation was based on geological data mainly stratigraphic results of exploratory wells drilled by Petrobras and majorly seismic and potential field data to support the interpreta tion of the tectono-sedimentary architecture of the several segments along the continental margin Mohriak and Fainstein 2012 Between Corresponding author E-mail addresses fmourac95

104541 the mid-1970s and the mid-1980s the Campos Basin was established as an important oil producer However due to the second oil crisis and the need to increase domestic production it was necessary to search for new petroleum sources In 1980 the first occurrence of oil stored in turbidite sandstones in the post-salt section was registered in the Santos Basin Fig 1 In 2005 the discovery of a carbonate reservoir in the deep pre-salt succession at the south portion of the basin increased the expectation of a great oil producer Chang et al 2008 Souza and Sgarbi 2016 2019 However characterizing deep water features can be defiant because the mineralogical composition and diagenetic pro cesses can interfere with variations in pore shape and interconnectivity thus exerting a high influence on the elastic properties of carbonate rocks Dias et al 2019 As a result of the pre-salt discovery in 2005 the Santos Basin gained significant attention and became the focus of numerous studies to sup port oil and gas exploration Souza et al 2007 associated the presence of transversal structures in the north portion of the basin with possible transfer faults by combining 2D seismic gravity and magnetic data integrated with well logs Assine et al 2008 defined the depocenter migration of the stratigraphic sequences using seismic sections and well logs showing how the salt tectonics is intimately related to the evolution of the Neo-Cretaceous progradational clastic wedges and consequently conditioning the hydrocarbon migration of the post-salt section in the Santos Basin Halokinesis also play an important role in controlling the structural styles of petroleum systems In the Santos Basin the investi gation of the interplay between salt and sediment integrating seismic interpretation kinematic restoration and analog modeling led to the conclusion that differential loading was the main driving mechanism to trigger halokinesis Guerra and Underhill 2012 In addition to the seismic interpretation sedimentary analysis is also performed based on integrating sidewall core samples and well logs The seismic patterns discrimination is used to characterize the tectonic and depositional evolution of the Barra Velha Formation in a sector of the Outer High of the Santos Basin leading to the definition of shallowing and flooding upwards cycles responsible for the pre-salt reservoirs deposition Neves et al 2019 Regarding the B zios Field Fig 1 Castro and Lupinacci 2019 proposed a flow of characterization of the pre-salt carbonate reservoirs from well logs aiming to evaluate the Barra Velha and Itapema forma tions by rock physics crossplots In this work the authors also propose segmenting the rift-sag phase into Lower Sag and Upper Sag Modeling the distribution of petrophysical properties of a reservoir assists in the spatial characterization of these complex deposits Thus a model-based inversion of seismic data into an acoustic impedance volume was applied to the evaluation of the relationship between acoustic imped ance and porosity showing trends related to Mg-clays contends in the B zios Field reservoir Dias et al 2019 Seismic attributes are important to assist the subsurface interpreta tion from seismic data and are defined as any measure of seismic data that helps us visually enhance or quantify features of interpretation in terest Chopra and Marfurt 2007 In a general sense this definition encompasses all quantities extracted from seismic data by calculations such as impedance inversion and pore -pressure prediction The appli cation of seismic attributes is widely used in the characterization of a petroleum reservoir Thus these attributes aim to provide accurate and detailed information to the interpreter on structural stratigraphic and lithological parameters of the seismic prospect Taner 2001 Chopra and Marfurt 2007 Summarily according to Brown 2011 time-derived attributes provide structural information and amplitude-derived attributes pro vide stratigraphic and reservoir information Frequency-derived attri butes are poorly understood however they could provide additional useful stratigraphic and reservoir information Attenuation can yield information on permeability Hybrid attributes are a combination of amplitude and frequency information Each of these attributes relates to each other where some attributes have a particular sensitivity to the nature of the reservoir and several others are better at presenting in formation or subsurface anomalies that were not initially identified by Fig

the conventional data or materials as an indicator of the presence of hydrocarbons Abdullah et al 2005 in Pamungkas et al 2021 In this context the attributes defined as instantaneous are computed sample by sample and represent instantaneous variations of several parameters Instantaneous values of attributes such as trace envelope its derivatives frequency sweetness and phase may be determined from complex traces Taner 2001 The calculation of the instantaneous attributes is based on the conversion of the real-valued input traces into complex-valued traces based on the Hilbert transform The output of this operation is amplitude waveform envelope or absolute value of the analytic signal phase the argument of the complex-valued trace frequency the scaled time derivative of the instantaneous phase and sweetness instantaneous amplitude divided by the square root of instantaneous frequency DUG 2020 Multi-attribute analyses have been used to characterize pre and postsalt petroleum systems For example Silva 2012 applied seismic at tributes instantaneous frequency RMS amplitude integrated trace cosine phase and amplitude envelope combined with well data and the inversion techniques for the delimitation and the characterization of a complex reservoir system from the tertiary turbidite channels located in the Lower Basin of Congo Artificial intelligence can also support the use of seismic attributes in reservoir identification and prediction of the environment of deposition Obafemi et al 2020 integrated two lith ofacies and fluid-discriminating seismic attributes via an unsupervised artificial neural network to characterize the architecture of deepwater turbidite channels and submarine fan lobes across a hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir within the Frem Field in the Niger Delta Souza 2021 characterized the southeast portion of the hydrocarbon producer basin of Taranaki New Zealand This research is anchored in two independent attributes curvature and coherence which proved efficient in delineating structural and stratigraphic discontinuities such as channels faults and fractures and seismic facies The use of multi-attributes enhances and accelerates the process of seismic interpretation In the Campos Basin Schmidt 2013 employed Maximum Ampli tude Maximum Magnitude e RMS Amplitude to characterize the car bonate reservoir of the Bonito Field Considering the heterogeneous carbonate rocks from the Brazilian pre-salt layers the amplitude attri butes provided the most distinguishable seismic response To the south of the Santos Basin the use of instantaneous seismic attributes such as envelope phase and instantaneous frequency has facilitated the inter pretation of 2D post-stack seismic sections leading to the identification of gas hydrate indicators in the Pelotas Basin Dias et al 2019 In the central part of the Santos Basin multiple seismic attributes combined with machine learning algorithms are used to identify strati fications within the salt layer showing that the correct facies identifi cation allows adjusting the drilling parameters accordingly to the estimated salt type minimizing operational problems and economic losses Mesquita et al 2021 Ferreira et al 2021 propose using an unsupervised artificial neural network algorithm to perform seismic facies classification in the B zios Field This research was based on a unique combination of stratigraphic and structural attributes local flatness principal dip component acoustic impedance and RMS amplitude The latter two attributes were essential for the delimitation of the carbonate platform facies while the first and second ones were essential to discriminate the debris and build-up facies As the vast majority of recent studies focus solely on the reservoir of the B zios Field there is a noticeable lack of published research con cerning the stratigraphic geometric and spatial relationships of the other units that comprise the geological framework of this area Therefore this research aims to address this gap by examining the comprehensive geological framework of the region encompassing various units and their interconnections This broad approach will contribute to a more thorough understanding of the geological evolution and potential reservoir characteristics in the B zios Field area In this case this study proposes a three-dimensional investigation of the features observed throughout the geological framework of the Santos Basin in the B zios Field area In this paper we propose a quantitative and qualitative classification of seismic facies using multi-attribute analysis allied to the integration of well logs in the B zios Field to characterize three-dimensionally the geological framework of the area within the Santos Basin The study also aims to reconstitute the basin s tectonostratigraphic evolution in the context of the South Atlantic Ocean opening by unraveling the relationship between the geological units and its seismic response This research has the potential to contribute to the future development of more concise predictive and detailed geological models for oil exploration in the basin 2 Location and geological framework The Santos Basin Fig 1 is a passive margin basin related to the Gondwana breakup event during the Neocominian The tectonic evo lution of this basin is divided into three mega-sequences rift post-rift sag and drift presented in Fig 2 Mio et al 2005 Moreira et al 2007 The Cambori Pi arras and Itapema formations represent the rift stage related to the separation of South-American and African paleocontinents during the end of Neocomian and the beginning of Aptian and are responsible for initiating the lacustrine deposition Moreira et al 2007 The post-rift or sag sequence represents a transitional stage from continental to marine environment with softer tectonics during the Aptian Moreira et al 2007 This transitional stage is represented by the non-marine and shallow-water carbonates of the Barra Velha For mation and the thick overlying evaporite seal of the Ariri Formation Buckley et al 2015 The last phase of the Santos Basin evolution is the continental drift responsible for the installation of a well-established basin associated with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean since the Albian Moreira et al 2007 This mega-sequence is related to thermal subsidence associated with halokinesis and is subdivided into three sequences deposited dur ing a progressive increase of the basin depth the Camburi Frade and Itamambuca groups The first one is a result of the rising sea level and is represented by the lower Floriano polis Guaruja and lower Itanhae m formations The Frade Group represents a marine regression stage where the coastline has advanced up to 200 km towards the continent The end of the drift phase is marked by the prograding system of the Itamambuca Group with expressive development of clinoforms of slope and the advance of the platform break-up Milani et al 2000 Moreira et al 2007 Papaterra 2010 The B zios Field located in the central portion of the Santos Basin Fig 1 is one of the most productive fields in the area In the B zios Field area the rift mega-sequence begins with the extrusion of the Cambori Formation continental basalts which are interlayered with volcaniclastic rocks as shown in composite log registers 3-BRSA-1053RJS The rift mega-sequence is heavily influenced by tectonics and is divided into upper and lower sequences The lower sequence is char acterized by the Pi arras Formation which exhibits the greatest devel opment of sedimentary wedges with thickening towards the hanging wall reaching thicknesses of up to 2200 m The upper sequence corre sponds to the Itapema Formation which includes the coquinas sec tion consisting of a thick package up to 300 m of bivalve rudstones and to a lesser extent bioclastic grainstones packstones wackstones mudstones and shales that were deposited in high-energy environments Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 Regarding the post-rift mega-sequence the carbonates of the Barra Velha Formation in the B zios Field occur in various facies such as Mgrich clays stevensite shrubs spherulites and fine-grained carbonates These carbonates range in thickness from approximately 200 to 400 m at structural highs Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 Ferreira 2022 The basal and upper portions of the Barra Velha Formation are domi nated by fine-grained carbonate sediments while intermediate portion is dominated by in-situ carbonate sedimentation with shrubs and 3 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Fig 2 Simplified stratigraphic chart for Santos Basin Adapted from Moreira et al 2007 in Arai and Viviers 2013 spherulites Ferreira 2022 The salt structures of the Ariri Formation reach thicknesses of up to 2650 m in the central portion of the B zios Field with decreasing thickness towards the north and south forming salt windows or scars The stratification of the evaporites begins with the precipitation of anhydrite at the base followed by a thick package of halite which is the

whole drift mega-sequence consists of the overburden rocks Chang et al 2008 3 Methods and materials The B zios Field is covered by 2586 km2 of 3D post-stack depth migrated seismic PSDM which encompasses gamma-ray density Psonic and resistivity logs from forty wells Fig 3 Our work focused on 715 km2 of the 3D PSDM seismic and six wells with depth interval from 2000 to 9995 m 3 1 Seismic interpretation We interpreted five key horizons and the main faults in a grid of 17 inlines and 28 crosslines with spacing varying from 500 m to 2000 m Fig 3 We first traced the faults then the well-marked horizons with good lateral continuity and high illumination supporting on the well data To trace the deepest and the less continuous horizons it was 4 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South

logs The attributes used in this work are described below attribute was calculated by the ratio instantaneous amplitude over the square root of instantaneous frequency according to Oliveros and Radovich 1999 Semblance similarity geometrical attribute which is also used as a good indicator of lateral continuity and bedding similarity Taner 2001 It was obtained by the equations presented by Marfurt et al 1998 Instantaneous amplitude attribute sensitive to major lithologic changes and lateral variations in bed thicknesses It was extracted using the method of complex trace analysis proposed by Taner et al 1979 Instantaneous phase physical attribute effectively used as a discriminator for geometrical shape classification which works as a good indicator of lateral continuity Taner 2001 It can be calcu lated as proposed by Taner et al 1979 Instantaneous sweetness highlights large differences in acoustic impedance and is highly sensitive to frequency variation The 3 2 Well-log analysis Data from forty well logs were organized processed and standard ized Most of the available well logs are in DLIS format Digital Log Interchange Standard which is incompatible with the software used 5 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 4 1 Recognition and classification of the seismic patterns seismic facies Therefore the profiles were converted from DLIS to LAS Log ASCII Standard format The next step was to standardize the density g cm3 gamma-rays GAPI P slowness s ft and resistivity ohm m curves They were unified and the class scale of tracks and colors of each curve were adjusted Six of the forty available well logs were selected to be analyzed Fig 3 A priori the main criteria for wells selection was vertical sampling so that the curves covered the greatest possible interval in depth Secondly it was the availability of a composite log In this way the selected wells were 2-ANP-1-RJS 3-BRSA-1053-RJS 8-BUZ-20-RJS 8-BUZ-21D-RJS 8-BUZ-26-RJS and 8-BUZ-28DA-RJS The curves were processed by a smoothing filter which uses the method of a trimmed mean of the middle N values in the window where N is the window trimmed by 25 i e the average of the middle 75 of the values excluding the upper 12 5 and lower 12 5 of the sorted values The statistical analysis consists of a calculation of maximum and minimum values the average mean and the standard deviation of the four curves in the interval of each key seismic unit described in the following section To better understand the three-dimensional framework and the tec tonostratigraphic evolution of the Santos Basin six seismic units were identified with distinct characteristics throughout the study area Fig 4 These units designated as A B C D E and F were differen tiated using the well logs the seismic amplitude analysis and the instantaneous amplitude phase sweetness and semblance similarity volumes Fig 5 Unit A is topped by horizon 1 depicted in pink in Figs 4 and 5 which occurs at an average depth of 7500 m The contact with the overlying Unit B can be either tectonic when the unit is disrupted by normal faults or lithological unconformity This unit is mainly charac terized by weak or absent reflectors that lack continuity and illumina tion making it challenging to define its boundaries Consequently the use of seismic attributes is crucial for accurate delineation The instan taneous amplitude attribute shows a homogeneous white pattern sug gesting a massive composition Fig 5-A The most effective attribute for discriminating Unit A is the instantaneous phase which reveals a chaotic pattern indicating a lack of lateral continuity Feature 1 in Fig 5B However defining the top of this unit posed significant challenges due to the limited seismic resolution at great depths The instantaneous sweetness attribute indicates values near zero suggesting the absence of notable structures or lithologic variations Fig 5-C Finally the semblance attribute displays a dark pattern indicating high dissimi larity with the surrounding area Fig 5-D 4 Results The results are categorized into four sections as described below seismic pattern

Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Horizon 2 shown in orange in Figs 4 and 5 delineates the upper boundary of Unit B This surface occurs at an average depth of 5950 m Unit B is characterized by a pattern of reflectors that range from divergent or oblique parallel to locally chaotic at the footwalls base with high amplitude medium to low illumination and intermediate lateral continuity Fig 4-A and B It displays a wedge-shaped geometry In areas where the horsts of Unit A are located there is a decrease in layer thickness Regarding seismic attributes the instantaneous amplitude does not exhibit a well-defined pattern but dark features parallel to the base of the unit horizon 1 are observed interleaved with a white chaotic re gion Feature 2 in Fig 5-A The instantaneous phase attribute distin guishes units A and B well with a change from a chaotic pattern to a divergent and oblique parallel one that evidences good lateral continuity of the reflectors Feature 3 in Fig 5-B Unit B predominantly displays high sweetness in dark blue with minor intercalations of low sweetness in yellow to red parallel to the top of the unit horizon 2 Fig 5-C Semblance is predominantly high and highlights the reflectors diver gent pattern and inclination Fig 5-D Unit C is bounded at the top by horizon 3 shown in green in Figs 4 and 5 which occurs at an average depth of 5700 m This unit is sepa rated from Unit B by a significant discontinuity which marks the change in the divergent pattern to a planar-parallel one Fig 4-A and B The surface used as the base marker is a horizon with very high illumination and negative amplitude where an onlapping feature is observed Another important feature is the occurrence of mounds at the top of the unit Instantaneous amplitude and sweetness do not provide a clear response for this unit resulting in a highly homogeneous pattern Fig 5A and B The instantaneous phase shows a discrete change in pattern compared to Unit B marked by an increase in bed thickness expressed by the increase of the distance between two consecutive reflectors Fig 5-C Semblance exhibits a gradual change from planar-parallel white to chaotic dark-blue black patterns toward the N-NW The white portion of high similarity indicates a homogeneous composition while the dark portion indicates abrupt structural variation Feature 4 in Fig 5-D The top of Unit D is marked by Horizon 4 in blue in Figs 4 and 5 This horizon ranges in depth from 2490 m to 6330 m with an average depth of 3550 m The thickness of this unit decreases towards the NW resulting in direct contact between units C and F Feature 5 in Fig 4-B The seismic response of this unit is highly heterogeneous displaying three main patterns without stratification Feature 6 in Fig 4-B with little marked stratification Feature 7 in Fig 4-B and with well-marked stratification Feature 8 in Fig 4-B The deepest domain lacks stratifi cation and has chaotic to absent reflectors The intermediate domain typically exhibits a chaotic to wavy seismic pattern with weak stratifi cation while the shallowest domain has well-marked stratification characterized by wavy to plane-parallel reflectors high amplitude high illumination and low lateral continuity Generally the stratification of this unit is parallel to the irregular surface of its top Instantaneous amplitude strongly emphasizes Horizon 4 revealing a well-marked dark surface indicating an abrupt lithologic variation Fig 5-A This attribute also confirms the existence of a stratified portion at the top of Unit D as shown by the alternation of wavy dark and light regions The domain without stratification is marked by a relatively homogeneous white pattern resulting in low amplitude en velope values The instantaneous phase attribute effectively highlights the domain without stratification due to its chaotic pattern and lack of continuity Fig 5-B The domain with well-marked stratification dis plays intermediate to good lateral continuity Instantaneous sweetness highlights a chaotic pattern with low to medium sweetness in the center of Unit D contoured by layers with high sweetness parallel to Horizon 4 Feature 9 in Fig 5-C Semblance provides visualization of stratified areas adjacent to the top highlighted by light-blue to white segments in the flanks of antiforms and black in the hinges Fig 5-D Horizon 5 dark blue in Figs 4 and 5 marks the top of Unit E which surface ranges in depth from 2910 m to 4290 m with an average depth of 3290 m This unit displays a heterogeneous seismic pattern charac terized by intermediate amplitude and illumination but high lateral continuity Fig 4-A and B Near the base the reflectors tend to follow the underlying unit topography and fill mini-basins between the Unit D domes Feature 10 in Fig 4-B In these regions the unit exhibits a wavy pattern with onlapping terminations where reflectors are thick at the depocentre and thinner as it moves away from the center On the steepest slopes Unit E has a chaotic pattern while towards the top the reflectors are plane-parallel Interweaved mound-like features with wavy to plane-parallel internal reflectors Fig 6 occur in the north portion of the study area The unit is generally intensely deformed and crossed by multiple sets of normal faults The instantaneous amplitude attribute reveals the existence of expressive surfaces marked by black color parallel to the unit stratifi cation and a mound-shaped feature in the north Feature 11 in Fig 5-A The instantaneous phase effectively enhances the wavy to plane-parallel pattern and the high lateral continuity of the reflectors Next to the base of the hanging walls this attribute shows a chaotic pattern Feature 12 in Fig 5-B Sweetness shows the intercalation of thick layers of high medium and low sweetness at the top and a heterogeneous pattern composed of medium to low sweetness where the mound-like features occur Fig 5-C Semblance also reveals the plane-parallel and wavy patterns but it highlights little disruption marked by dark patches into the medium to high semblance reflectors Feature 13 in Fig 5-D Seismic unit F is characterized by a parallel configuration with wellmarked flat reflectors that exhibit a plane-parallel configuration high illumination low amplitude and high lateral continuity Fig 4-A and B It differs from the underlying unit E by the intensity of deformation An important feature observed throughout the study area is an erosive surface at the top of Unit E at depths lower than 2500 m Feature 14 in Fig 4-A This surface is curved and locally undulated and is marked by an abrupt disruption of reflectors The instantaneous amplitude better discriminates between units E and F with the latter presenting a homogeneous plane-parallel pattern marked by alternating high black medium grey and low white reflectivity This attribute also reveals the great lateral continuity and relatively constant thickness of layers Feature 15 in Fig 5-A The instantaneous phase attribute highlights the great lateral continuity and distinguishes units E and F by the decrease of reflector thickness in the latter Fig 5-B Moreover sweetness shows a distinct intercalation of thin layers of high medium and low sweetness Fig 5-C Semblance outlines the plane-parallel pattern predominantly formed by white layers high similarity with dark areas around faults and structural highs of Unit D Feature 16 in Fig 5-D Fig 7 summarizes the six aforementioned seismic patterns where the main characteristics of each unit are presented with their respective instantaneous amplitude instantaneous phase sweetness and semblance attributes 4 2 Analysis of the identified structures The studied area can be divided into two structural domains deep and shallow ones separated by horizon 3 Figs 8 and 9 respectively Both domains consist of normal faults in which the deep structures display NE-SW azimuth roughly parallel to the Brazilian coastline and dip between 50 and 80 and the shallow structures have E-W to NW-SE azimuth and dip between 30 and 60 The deep structures consist of five main normal faults with curved surfaces which occur below 5000 m depth In the 3D model they are discriminated by different colors green pink red dark blue and yellow Fig 8 Two main faults are N S trending green and pink ones dipping about 50 60 to W and occurs in the central portion of the B zios Field In the NE region of the study area the pink fault is deflected towards NESW and its dip angle decrease The red fault trends to the NE-SW di rection and dips 60 80 to NW The fault represented in dark blue also 8 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Fig 6 A Non-interpreted and B

patterns showing instantaneous amplitude instantaneous phase sweetness and semblance attributes for units A to F Source the authors trends to NE-SW but it dips about 70 to SE The yellow fault is trending approximately W-E and dips 60 65 to the north All of these faults cross units A and B and only the yellow one crosses units A B and C reaching the base of Unit D The set of these structures forms grabens half-grabens and horsts When half-graben geometries occur the blocks are slightly tilted to NE The group formed by the shallow structures consists of nine major normal faults which occur above 5000 m depth The major faults are also discriminated by colors according to Fig 9 The fault colored in pink dips 40 -55 S and has a curved surface its direction is approximately EW with a deflection towards NW where occurs a thick dome from Unit D The group formed by the parallel normal faults marked in purple light blue and light green has the same E-W deflected to NW trend but the opposite dip direction 40 -55 N which may represent a conjugate pair with the pink fault Other conjugate pairs occur towards S-SE coinciding with the unit D highs In the central portion the conjugate pair formed by the yellow and dark red faults also contours the Unit D domes and has the same E-W deflection around the dome The dark red fault dips 30 50 to the north and exhibits the largest vertical slip up to 600 m Fig 10 and outlines the horizon 5 geometry consequently conditioning Unit E and the lower portion of Unit F thickness Fig 10 shows this great displacement and the tilting of blocks of units E and F to 9 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Fig 8 Set of deep structures The map on the left represents a depth slice of 6680 m within the

portion of the study area has the same direction and dip as the dark green and orange ones but a more constrained lateral expression Additionally transtractive features e g negative flower structures were observed at the top of the Unit D highs In general semblance is the seismic attribute that better highlights these faults by black lines which mark high dissimilarity Under the surface of erosion observed in Unit F it is possible to observe other associated structures such as drag folds that form a syn clinal right under the fault plane pink fault Fig 11 The synclinal configures a normal drag

tectonostratigraphic evolution of the B zios Field and contribute to the understanding of the evolution of the Santos Basin Starting from Unit A it is common to observe half-grabens grabens and horsts delimited by normal faults Towards N-NW this unit is deeper due to the presence of half-grabens constrained by faults dip ping to N-NW The opposite behavior is observed towards S-SE in which Unit A forms structural highs shaping the adjacent unit Fig 12 Unit B has a relatively heterogeneous geometry with variable thickness conditioned by the grabens and horsts formed by Unit A The isopach map Fig 13-A shows thickness varying from approximately 300 to 2900 m The lowest thickness 50 m is observed in the south portion of the study area where Unit A forms an expressive horst There is an expressive thickening towards N-NW following the topography created by the normal faults that cross units A B and the base of Unit C Unit C has a relatively constant thickness ranging from approxi mately 50 to 600 m with an average mean thickness of around 300 m From the isopach map Fig 13-B it is evident that there is a slight variation in thickness across the study area with a tendency to thicken towards the S-SE The top and base surfaces of the unit are mainly regular horizons with a slight downward flexure towards the NE in the 4 3 Threedimensional geological model After describing these six seismofacies with two-dimensional sec tions it is essential to analyze their three-dimensional arrangement to 10 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541

forming structural highs next to the base of the unit Unit D exhibits significant variation in thickness and morphologies Figs 12 and 13-C Its thickness ranges from 0 to approximately 3300 m In the northern part of the study area the unit is thin 0 300 m and lies between steep and thick domes and diapirs with thicknesses of approximately 2900 m that form complex ellipsoidal-like morphologies see Figs 12 and 13-C In the north region it is observed steep relief domes and walls with relatively flat tops with about 12 km of extension and associated small shallow depressions Feature 1 in Fig 14-B In NW of the B zios Field windows or scars occur in association with an expressive thinning of Unit D Feature 2 in Fig 14-B Pillows are also observed in the vicinity of these scars Feature 3 in Fig 14-B Towards SE the unit s topography gets more irregular with the alternation of thick anticlinals and synclinals features Feature 4 in Fig 14-B In the southeast gravitational collapse features are observed Shallow faults described in item 4 2 follow these thin and round-shaped portions This behavior is consistent across the unit s extensions although the thick ness is less variable towards the S-SE where domes are less steep and thickness ranges from approximately 800 to 2700 m Unit D is consid erably thicker in this area and the topography is slightly less irregular The isopach map of Unit E shows a counter mold to the thickness of Unit D Fig 13-D Where Unit D is thin in the north Unit E is thicker up to 3600 m In the central part of the study area Unit E exhibits an average thickness of approximately 700 m Remarkably thin regions of Unit E follow the trace of the shallow faults In the south Unit E has a relatively constant thickness of about 1000 m The top surface of the unit horizon 5 is predominantly flat but discontinuous due to the presence of dip-slip faults Unit F is characterized by a relatively constant thickness of approx imately 500 m Fig 13-E with minor variations in proximity to fault 11 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Fig 11 A Drag fold formed under the pink fault plane pointed by a red arrow B Detailed

lows which host mini-basins of Unit E When the Unit D lows overlap with fault zones the thickness of this package usually in creases significantly reaching up to 1800 m period of basin evolution characterized by mechanical extension It is also reflected in stratigraphic features that indicate syn-depositional fault movement The post-rift term denotes any strata that form after the active extensional tectonics Based on the evidence of the initial stages of the rifting process such as grabens and half-grabens Unit A was classified as Syn-Rift I phase It is important to note that volcanic rocks can also represent a pre-rift stage such as in the Southern Red Sea Yemen where an astheno spheric plume occurs cf Mitchell et al 1992 Unit B also displays seismic patterns consistent with syn-rift tec tonics as demonstrated by Prosser 1993 Fig 17 and we interpreted it as a Syn-Rift II stage In the study area these features take the form of wedge-shaped geometry created by divergent reflectors with an oblique parallel configuration Fig 18 Additionally the portions of Unit B that exhibit the divergent and oblique parallel pattern with the classic wedge-shaped configuration may represent the initiation of the rift The divergence of reflectors may be a consequence of syn-tectonic deposition Kuchle 2010 The chaotic pattern observed near the base of the footwall slope can be associated with the climax stage and suggests aggradation Unit C was interpreted as a Post-Rift I stage due to the change from the divergent to a plane-parallel pattern indicating the transition from syn-rift to post-rift phase according to Bosence 1998 In the post-rift phase the filling of the basin is characterized by aggradational and progradational geometries which surfaces dip in the direction of the increase of the accommodation space in the center of the basin The horizontal and plane parallel configuration of Unit C reflectors could represent a reflex of its deposition after intense tectonic activity Kuchle 2010 Although the base of Unit C is affected by some of the normal faults it was not interpreted as a part of the syn-rift section This feature was considered a posterior reactivation of the syn-rift faulting Macedo et al 2021 argue the faults that affect the top of the post-rift or sag section indicate the tectonic activity is at least locally controlling the post-rift sedimentation in the B zios Field area Unit D was interpreted as the saline section of the Santos Basin representing a Post-Rift II stage This unit was interpreted as post-rift once it was not affected by the normal faults associated with the rift phase Mitchell et al 1992 describe syn-rift evaporites Red Sea Yemen where the salt section is intensely controlled by the rift faults contrary to what we observed in the study area The domain without stratification of Unit D was interpreted as a halite-rich portion with predominantly massive composition without pervasive structures such as bedding or foliation Unit E and F represent the establishment of the passive margin of the 4 4 Well-log analysis and statistics The analyzed log intervals of units B C D E

deviation are pre sented in Table 1 5 Discussions 5 1 Interpreted units in the context of a marine rift basin and its tectonic components To incorporate the interpreted seismic units into the geological his tory of the Santos Basin it is necessary to correlate these units to the tectonic compartments of a marine rift basin Firstly it is important to comprehend some tectonostratigraphic

Basin Unit E is interpreted as synchronous with the beginning of continental drift representing a Drift I phase while Unit F is conceived as a posterior stage Drift II The major criterion for discriminating between units E and F is the amount of deformation since Unit E is intensely deformed by the upward movement of the underlying package Consequently Unit E is understood as syn-halokinesis while the unit F is interpreted as posterior mainly affected by predominantly extensional tensions in the continental drift process The instantaneous amplitude attribute reveals the existence of expressive surfaces marked by the black color parallel to the unit stratification which probably marks smaller cycles of stratification in the context of the basin opening opening begins with the deposition of the continental basalts of the Syn-Rift I stage related to the Cambori Formation between the end of Valanginian and Barremian Although this unit is not identified by any of the wells this correlation was made exclusively by the seismic expression of the unit chaotic to absent reflectors and what is regionally known as the economic basement of the Santos Basin The Syn-Rift II unit was deposited as the extensional stresses continued to act on the basin In this context the basin infill consists of alluvial fan sediments in the proximal portions and lacustrine lithologies in the distal portion deposited from the Barremian to the Eo-Aptian Analyzing the behavior of the logs in the interval of Syn-Rift II unit Unit B the major difference consists of the gamma-ray and resistivity curves There is an abrupt change in the pattern of these curves in the transition from Unit C and Unit B especially in 8-BUZ-21D-RJS and 8BUZ-26-RJS wells Horizon 2 is marked by a peak in GR values from 50 to 88 GAPI The peaks with higher values of gamma-ray can be associated with the presence of shales with Mg-clays described in the Itapema Formation In some wells significant increases in the GR values were identified during the transition from the Itapema Formation to the Barra Velha Formation Castro 2019 also associates these peaks with 5 2 Interpreted units in the stratigraphic context of the Santos Basin In the attempt to understand how the seismic expression of the interpreted unit is linked to the geological framework of the Santos Basin the analysis of the

package with a simple parallel infill Extracted from Prosser 1993 shales of the Itapema Formation in some wells while in others they are associated with organic-rich mudstones or carbonates of the Barra Velha Formation In this work the entire Syn-Rift II unit is correlated to the Itapema Pi arras interval Assuming the Syn-Rift II unit represents the Pi arras and Itapema formations the overlying package Post-Rift I unit corresponds to the Barra Velha Formation This moment represents the beginning of the transition from a continental to a shallow marine environment The Barra Velha carbonates are assumed to have been deposited in a shallow alkaline lake from the hyperextension of the lithosphere and increased geothermal gradients to levels favorable for the generation of alkali-rich brines Farias et al 2019 In the transition between the Post-Rift I unit Unit C and the other units Syn-Rift II and Post-Rift II all the analyzed curves exhibit an abrupt change in the pattern 18 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Fig 18 Detailed view of inline 4375 A Non-interpreted and B interpreted seismic profile The dotted polygon highlights a half-graben exhibiting a wedge-shaped geometry with oblique-parallel internal reflectors in Syn-Rift I unit and sub-parallel to plane-parallel reflectors in the Post-Rift I unit Letters A B C D E and F refer to units A B C D E and F respectively Source the authors The major difference between Post-Rift I and the overlying Post-Rift II unit is the great increase in density and decrease of slowness in the former The average mean of P-sonic calculated from the six selected wells yielded values from 57 to 64 us ft Vp 4750 m s to 5335 m s The controls on sonic velocity in carbonates presented in Anselmetti and Eberli 1993 depend on a series of parameters such as effective pres sure depositional environment diagenetic alterations and age of the sediment According to Anselmetti and Eberli 1993 the carbonate rocks show a broad interval of P-velocities from 2000 m s up to 6000 m s Velocities of carbonates that were deposited on the shallower water platform have higher velocities than the deeper water samples This relation can be explained by the higher diagenetic potential of shallow-water carbonates The explanation for these observed velocity patterns is that the platform is usually rich in coarse-grained carbonates and metastable minerals like beds of shrub-like crystals and diagenetic spherulites growing in the magnesium clay matrix described in the Santos Basin Farias et al 2019 Consequently the velocities of this section in the study area from 4750 m s to 5335 m s corroborate the hypothesis of a shallow-water origin Moreover 8-BUZ-26-RJS and 8-BUZ-28DA-RJS wells show an important decrease in resistivity at approximately 5800 m This behavior can be associated with the pres ence of a high-resistivity material in the upper portion of Unit C Once 19 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 the upper portion is covered by the base of the salt layer horizon 3 it is reasonable to suggest the presence of oil at the top of the Barra Velha Formation at the locations of 8-BUZ-26-RJS and 8-BUZ-28DA-RJS wells According to Tavares da Silva and Gordon 2021 these carbonates display variable amplitude and small-scale progradation are rarely affected by faults and exhibit common features such as carbonate ramps and mounds deposited preferentially onto preexisting basement highs These features are consistent with the ones observed in the study area such as sub-parallel to parallel reflectors with mound geometries at the top of Unit C The sub-parallel to the parallel pattern can be associated with the aggradational flat-topped carbonate platform described in Buckley et al 2015 while the mounds are associated with carbonate build-up facies see Ferreira et al 2021 Note that all the analyzed curves exhibit an abrupt change in the pattern when passing from Post-Rift I to Post-Rift II units Probably this is a consequence of a considerable change in the lithology This is related to an unconformity that separates the carbonate sequence from the evaporite one Buckley et al 2015 Therefore the Post-Rift II unit represents the transition between the sag and transitional environment deposited within a high evaporation rate lake associated with periodic marine transgressions in the Neo-Aptian Gambo a et al 2008 The argument of a transition from carbonate to evaporite composition is consistent once there is a considerable decrease in density and a slight increase of the P-sonic values This is an expected behavior since the mean P-wave velocity of halite the major component of the saline section in the B zios Field is 4549 m s and its density is 2 03 g cm3 Mohriak et al 2008 in Justen et al 2013 Well-logs from the Post-Rift II unit provided values of density average mean from 2 06 to 2 17 g cm3 and P-sonic average mean next to 68 us ft Vp 4504 m s Regarding the gamma-ray logs the Post-Rift II unit has the lowest values however it also exhibits some intercalated peaks of high signal The intercalation of high-value peaks in the upper part of the Post-Rift II unit is ascribed to the stratification of different types of salt similar to the Evident Strati fication Domain ESD proposed by Maul et al 2018 The extremely high GR values 200 GAPI are assigned to the presence of sylvite due to the potassium concentration Therefore Unit D is equivalent to the Ariri Formation At the base of the Drift I unit horizon 4 density is the highest and tends to decrease upwards at the same time P-slowness increases This abrupt change marks the implantation of a marine environment in the Santos Basin with the deposition of the post-breakup sediment packages from the Late Cretaceous to the Neogene Roughly the lower portion of the Drift I unit can be associated with the limestones from the Guaruja Formation This portion represents the installation of a carbonate plat form during the Albian The overlying package with lower density and higher slowness is assigned to a coarsening-up sequence once the coarser lithology tends to be more porous which explains the decrease in density and increase of slowness VP fluids VP rock Therefore the aforementioned upper portion of the Drift I unit is associated with the intercalation of diamictites from the Itaja -A u Formation deposited in the distal platform slope and basin environments This interval repre sents a regression phase where the limit of the platform advanced up to 200 km offshore The interweaved mound-shaped feature observed at the top of the Drift I unit Fig 5 was also interpreted as gravitational flow deposits At this depth 3200 m Moreira et al 2007 describe the presence of strongly channelized sandstones resulting from dense turbidity currents Ilhabela Member related to significant excavations on the slope and platform Drift I and II units have the highest average mean of gamma-ray and the lowest resistivity with the GR values being even higher for the Drift II unit The gamma-ray log highlights the intercalation of portions with high and medium GR values The high gamma-ray and low resistivity can be associated with the presence of the Marambaia Formation shales associated with marls once the presence of clay a highly radioactive material accommodates large amounts of interstitial water Gira o 2013 This also explains the low resistivity values once water is a conductive material and has very low resistance to electrical current Moreira et al 2007 describe the expressive occurrence of dark and radioactive shales throughout the drift mega-sequence The portions with medium gamma-ray values can be associated with the sandstone bodies intercalated with shales in the Marambaia Fm Interval In the context of the Santos Basin evolution the Drift II unit represents the moment when the carbonate platform reaches its greatest development in the Miocene From the Lower Miocene onwards lower-order se quences undergo transgressive development that reaches its peak in the Mid-Miocene Serravallian This interval marks the highest relative sea-level variation from the Miocene to the present resulting in the deposition of a substantial volume of sediments Moreira et al 2007 The interweaved mound-shaped feature Fig 6 observed at depths of about 2500 m was associated with gravitational deposits of the Maresias Member The surface of erosion depicted in Fig 11 possibly represents canyons infilled with mudstones or sandstones described to occur at slope portions in the Marambaia Fm shales and diamictites 5 3 The B zios Field in the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Santos Basin 5 3 1 Comparison with the Tupi Field The Tupi Field located approximately 50 km southwestward of the B zios Field is another giant petroleum field of the Santos Basin Fig 1 A series of comparisons can be placed between the Tupi and B zios fields based on recent works cf Adriano et al 2022 Fig 19 Compared to the B zios Field the Tupi Field exhibits an important NE-SW thinning of the Pi arras Itapema and Barra Velha formations constrained by the Cambori Formation high the Tupi High high lighted in Fig 19-B feature 1 Analyzing four seismic sections pre sented in Adriano et al 2022 the Barra Velha Formation is thicker than we interpreted in the study area Regarding the structures a remarkable difference is the rotation of the syn-rift blocks The blocks of the Tupi Field are tilted at a higher angle where the internal reflectors are more inclined than in the study area feature 2 in Fig 19-B According to Adriano et al 2022 there are three main sets of normal faults conditioning the rift phase NE-SW and N S trends faults control the Lower and Upper Rifts Cambori Pi arras Itapema and Lower Barra Velha formations while NW-SE trend conditions the Later Rift Upper Barra Velha Formation Our work mapped four main trends N S direction west-dipping NE-SW direction northwest-dipping NE-SW direction southeast-dipping and W-E trend dipping to north In this only the W-E trend yellow fault Fig 8 crosses the Barra Velha Formation Unit C while all the others are related to units A and B coherent with the NE-SW and N S trend faults described in Adriano et al 2022 5 3 2 Comparison with the Sapinhoa and Lapa fields The Sapinhoa and Lapa fields located ca 120 km southwestward of the B zios Field also have an important role in the pre-salt exploration Fig 1 Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 present the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Barra Velha Formation in the area of the Sapinhoa and Lapa fields According to interpreted sections shown in Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 Fig 20 there are remarkable differences from what was observed in our study The first and most prominent one is the geometry of the evaporite cover the Ariri Formation In the region of the Sapinhoa and Lapa the salt section is predominantly thick forming large salt walls feature 1 in Fig 20-B There is a widespread occurrence of this unit across the mapped area while in the northwest of the B zios Fied the salt section forms windows or scars due to the intense thinning or absence of this package Besides the salt in the area of Sapinhoa and Lapa fields is more stratified and the stratification is observed in vari able depths not restricted to the top of the unit as in the B zios Field In the interpreted NW-SE section from Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 tongues of the non-stratified salt are observed interfingered with 20 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Fig 19 Tupi Field seismic section presented in Adriano et al 2022 A Non-interpreted and B interpreted

Formations Light blue represents mounded features White double-arrowed lines represent the structural compartmentalization of the Tupi Field area Extracted from Adriano et al 2022 The red dotted circles represent the features f1 and f2 mentioned in the text stratified salt feature 2 in Fig 20-B model for this Early Cretaceous phase admits a small asthenospheric uplift Heilbron et al 2000 An important criterion that would support the distinction between pure and simple shear would be the presence of detachment surfaces associated with listric faults in the syn-rift stage suggestive of simple shear Although such structures were not observed it is not possible to determine their existence or absence The study scale up to 9000 m depth and the seismic survey resolution could have masked their detection Another important factor to consider is that both mechanisms can exist concomitantly and locally one or the other may predominate Therefore analyzing such a small area within an extensive regional context of the Santos Basin would not be sufficient to determine its opening mechanism i e the Santos Basin has features that suggest both pure and simple-shear mechanisms with some uplift caused by asthenospheric plumes However pure-shear or simple-shear strains likely occur at the same extensional zone Once the deformation is multiepisodic each one tends to be heterogeneously distributed rather than coincident Consequently the two concepts are not mutually exclusive Armstrong 1982 Although the rifting mechanism is not defined Rabinowitz and LaBrecque 1979 reconstructed the South Atlantic Ocean opening by a clockwise rotation around a pole in the northeast of Brazil Fig 21 presents a reconstruction of South Atlantic rifting by the late Aptian 107 M y modified from Rabinowitz and LaBrecque 1979 After this model Szatmari and Milani 2016 argue the rift was formed as a result of a southward increasing extension in the rear of South America s clockwise rotation This rotation occurred over an upper mantle kept anomalously hot before rifting by being continuously covered by west ern Gondwana s lithosphere for 350 400 Ma and heated by upwelling 5 3 3 Rifting evolution in the Santos Basin The next step of the research consists of investigating how the tec tonic evolution of the Santos Basin is expressed within the area of the B zios Field To do this it is crucial to understand how the Santos Basin was generated regarding the rifting mechanisms A brief review of the main types of rifting proposed by Bosence 1998 is presented in Appendix A Summarily there are four main types with specific re lationships with the observed stratigraphic patterns at the basin scale These mechanisms correspond to pure shear simple shear heteroge neous stretching and mantle plume-related McKenzie 1978 and Wernicke 1985 also discuss models of rifting and the development of rift basins see Appendix A Our research did not find sufficient evidence to determine which rifting mechanism was responsible for the opening of the Santos Basin In the small mapped area features suggestive of simple or pure shear were observed in the central portion of the basin such as expressive and laterally continuous syn- and post-rift layers red boxes in Appendix A Fig A1-A and B However the simple-shear model is predominantly characterized by differing distal and proximal regions This argument is consistent with what was observed in the comparison of the B zios proximal and Tupi Sapinhoa and Lapa distal fields In the B zios Field area the syn-rift section comprises the siliciclastic and carbonate rocks from Unit B Pi arras Itapema formations and also comprises the basaltic economic basement from Unit A Cambori Formation Since the plume-related model Fig A1-D Bosence 1998 suggests that the syn-rift section is entirely composed of a volcanic stratigraphy this model is not preferred here although the conceptual 21 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Fig 20 Sapinhoa and Lapa fields seismic section presented in Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 A Non-interpreted and B interpreted seismic profile The acronyms DIA and DPA stand for Intra-Alagoas Discordance and Pre-Alagoas Discordance respectively The seismic section location map displays the top map of the Barra Velha Formation Extracted from Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 The red dotted circles represent the features f1 and f2 mentioned in the text plumes The clockwise rotation of South America relative to Africa opened the wedge-shaped southward widening NNE-SSW to N S-trending South Atlantic rift while it compressed most of the ENE-WSW to E-W-trending Equatorial margin The rifting process both widened and deepened the South Atlantic basin towards the south Rift faulting migrated diachronically toward the future spreading center in South America from west to east The most widely accepted model regarding the evolution of the South Atlantic Ocean is summarized and explained by Heilbron et al 2000 after Cainelli and Mohriak 1998 1999b This model is based on the lithospheric stretching model proposed by McKenzie 1978 The first phase is characterized by the beginning of regional lithospheric extension which eventually led to the separation of the South American and African continents The next phase is marked by an increase in lithospheric stretching cf McKenzie 1978 coinciding with the development of large faults affecting the continental crust extrusion of continental flood basalts and formation of half-grabens After this early Cretaceous ttectonomagmatic episode tectonic stresses were directed toward the present-day continental margin These rifts which were fil led with Neocomian to Barremian volcanic and siliciclastic rocks evolved into the present-day passive margin sedimentary basins Towards the end of the rifting phase there was a further increase in lithospheric extension marked by large faults that rotated the rift blocks and the sedimentary layers previously deposited The inception of the oceanic crust probably involved the focus of the lithospheric stretching that was previously distributed in a wider region This phase is associ ated with volcanism reactivation of large faults and erosion of rift blocks by a regional unconformity that levels the topography separating continental from transitional to marine environments of deposition Above this unconformity and below the evaporite transitional sequence some sedimentary basins show a substantial thickness of Aptian silici clastic and carbonate rocks Following the deposition of salt in the Aptian sedimentation became predominantly carbonate An increase in bathymetry led to the deepening of the environment of deposition by the end of the Albian with the disappearance of the shallow-water carbonates 22 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Fig 21 Schematic figure of the reconstructed South Atlantic Rift by the late Aptian 107 M y modified from Rabinowitz and LaBrecque 1979 On the right the location of B zios Tupi Sapinhoa and Lapa fields within the Santos Basin The relative displacement of Africa and South America is represented by the black arrows Although Heilbron et al 2000 do not define the mechanism for the opening of the basins on the Brazilian east margin it can be concluded that it involves pure shear This is inferred because it is based on the model of constant and uniform stretching controlled by asthenospheric uplift proposed by McKenzie 1978 Furthermore the Brazilian passive margin and its African counterpart are portrayed as a large symmetrical basin in the schematic model presented in Heilbron et al 2000 Here we consider four main postulates of the South Atlantic Ocean opening and related salt tectonics after Heilbron et al 2000 Szatmari and Milani 2016 1 the clockwise rotation of South America relative to Africa about a pole located offshore NE Brazil 2 the rifting propa gation from south to north 3 rifting process widened and deepened the South Atlantic basin towards the south and 4 salt mobi lization maturity increases basinward Once the rifting spreading was N S the extension was approximately west to east by the time the continents started to separate Fig 21 With the clockwise rotation around a pole in NE Brazil the N S orientation was also rotated about the nowadays N S position In Fig 21 the direction of rifting high lighted in red corresponds to the N S orientation by the time the rifting was opening Fig 22 Block diagram showing the relationship between salt structures and maturity The relative position of B zios Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields within the increasing salt maturity is presented in red Modified from Jackson and Talbot 1991 in Gillhaus and Horvath 2008 23 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Based on these premises and the fact that the B zios Field occupies a position closer to the continental margin than Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa we suggest that the displacement caused by rifting was smaller in the B zios Field Fig 21 Therefore it is reasonable that the syn-rift blocks are more rotated in the area of the Tupi Field once it experimented with more displacement than the B zios area Once the displacement increased from west to east and the rifting process widened and deepened towards the south the same argument counts for the intensely mobilized and thicker salt layer in the Sapinhoa Lapa and Tupi fields area These areas are located at greater distances from the continental margin than B zios thus experimenting with more displacement A schematic diagram Fig 22 modified from Jackson and Talbot 1991 in Gillhaus and Horvath 2008 shows the relative positions of the B zios Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields in the context of salt maturity The thick package of the layer in Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa can be assigned to increased salt mobilization basinward due to the halokinesis Firstly it is essential to consider that the driving force for the rise of evaporite rocks through the non-saline cover rock is gravity combined with density differences between the less dense salt deep underground and its more dense cover rock The autonomous vertical movement of salt is predicated upon the progressive compaction and cementation of the overlying sand clay and carbonate layers in the cover rock as a result of basin subsidence until their density is as high or higher than the density of the salt layers Local uplift of the salt mainly begins in loca tions where there are already significant horizontal lithostatic pressure gradients above or within the salt Regional lithostatic pressure gradi ents exist in areas such as the transition zones between shelves and continental slopes where the bathymetry leads to a reduction in cover rock thickness towards the center of the basin Eisbacher 1996 Langer and Sch tte 2002 Gillhaus and Horvath 2008 Therefore it is ex pected that the proximal portion of the extensional basin experiments a less intense salt mobilization once the overburden package is thinner and consequently the lithostatic pressure is smaller Due to the basin ward deepening the opposite behavior occurs in the distal portion In this case the B zios Field is more proximal to the coastline and exhibits a thinner and less mobilized salt package than occurs in Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa areas Despite the continued efforts acting on the basin during continental drift in the study area the major factor influencing the deformation of the post-salt package is the salt tectonics This is concluded from the analysis of the observed structures and deformation patterns Fig 9 clearly shows the outline of salt domes and diapirs by post-salt faults Although halokinesis ceased during the Eo-Oligocene Corre a 2009 most of the deformation of the post-salt package was conditioned by salt tectonics even though there might be a component of deformation associated with the reactivation of syn-rift faults The major difference between units Drift I and II is the amount of deformation Once Drift I unit is greatly affected by the halokinesis Drift II unit is a predominantly regular package mostly affected by extensional efforts Horizon 5 which separates Drift I and II units may mark the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary tectonic reactivation which has resulted in increased salt tec tonics Meisling et al 2001 Cobbold et al 2001 This reactivation could explain the extensional faults in the throughout Drift II package since the halokinesis ceased during Eo-Oligocene in the Santos Basin Corre a 2009 Regarding the pre-salt section in the Sapinhoa Lapa fields the rifting faults intensely affect the Barra Velha Formation In the B zios Field region only one of the main mapped faults affects this unit while in the Sapinhoa Field a great part of the interpreted faults crosses the entire Barra Velha package reaching out to the base of the salt The higher angle tilting of the syn-rift blocks observed in the Tupi area is also explained by its position within the tectonic components of the Santos Basin The Tupi Field is located more distal from the continental margin than the B zios area Regarding the unit s thickness the thicker Barra Velha Formation package observed in the Tupi Field may be a consequence of the southward widening of the rift where great space of accommodation was generated by the time de post-rift sequence was deposited However it is important to highlight that besides de ac commodation space many parameters conditionate the carbonate pre cipitation such as climate Ph base level composition and solubility of the lake Besides that only a few sections were analyzed for this com parison thus the thickening of the Barra Velha Formation can be local and only a result of spots with a higher deposition rate By the same logic it is reasonable to infer that the Sapinhoa Lapa area also presents a thickening of the post-rift sequence once it is also located eastwards of the B zios Field In the sections shown in Ribeiro da Silva et al 2021 the salt package and the Barra Velha Formation are thicker than in the B zios Field area However it is important to high light that besides de accommodation space many parameters also conditionate the salt precipitation such as climate Ph base level composition and solubility among others of the evaporite lake In the study area four main sets of normal faults were mapped throughout the pre-salt section N S direction west-dipping NE-SW di rection northwest-dipping NE-SW direction southeast-dipping and W-E trend dipping to north The NE-SW faults are probably related to the main fracturing trend of the South Atlantic rift inherited from crystal line basement Ribeira Belt structures Stanton et al 2014 which generates the east-west displacement The W E fault yellow Fig 8 can be associated with a secondary and posterior trend caused by transfer zones Mohriak and Fainstein 2012 after Asmus and Ferrari 1978 and Meisling et al 2001 point out the W-E general trend suggests an oblique rift system marked by transfer zones some of which were reactivated during the formation of oceanic fracture zones At the eastern limit of continental crust transfer zones become aligned with ocean ridge transform faults which trend W-E across the South Atlantic Meisling et al 2001 Stanton et al 2014 describe the presence of structural W E trends predominant at the distal domain of the Santos Basin with orientation subparallel to the South Atlantic fracture zones This association is also made by Souza et al 2007 This argument supports the hypothesis of the W-E faults being posterior to the rifting fault since it affects the Post-Rift I Barra Velha Fm reaching out the base of salt One of the N S fault sets pink Fig 8 is deflected to NE This deflection can be associated with the ENE to NE-trending deflection of about 1000 km long described by Dehler et al 2016 and Szatmari and Milani 2016 The aforementioned feature is produced by left-lateral transtensional tectonics in the rift with a strong strike-slip component along NE-trending faults The occurrence of volcanic intrusions in the Santos Basin has been locally described Fornero et al 2019 describe the occurrence of approximately 400 m of basaltic subaerial flows in the SE deepwater portion of the Santos Basin at about 300 km from the coast These flows were deposited during the post-rift phase and were covered by the sequence of the Ariri Formation Moreover a thick and vertically ori ented intracrustal structure observed in the proximal portion of the Santos Basin is suggested as swarms of dikes with associated plugs controlled by the NE-SW structures of the rift Ferraz et al 2018 However these volcanic flows were not mapped in the study area At the research scale no features suggestive of volcanic intrusions were detected but this does not necessarily mean they are absent Zala n et al 2011 point out the Santos Campos and Esp rito Santo basins as a typical example of a magma-poor passive margin In sharp contrast the Pelotas Basin situated in the south of the Floriano polis High is the classic example of a volcanic margin with huge rifts filled mostly by volcanic material 5 3 4 Sismostratigraphy and tectonic implications In this research we used 3D seismic attributes and well-log data to characterize the B zios Field in three dimensions The major findings consist of the identification of six seismic units A B C D E and F which correspond to the tectonic stages Syn-Rift I Syn-Rift II Post-Rift I 24 F Moura Costa et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 131 2023 104541 Post-Rift II Drift I and Drift II respectively Based on well data units B C D E and F were correlated with the stratigraphy of the Santos Basin Unit B corresponds to the Pi arras Itapema interval while unit C is associated with the Barra Velha Formation Unit D represents the Ariri Fm and Unit E is related to the Guaruja and Itaja -A u formations as well as the turbidites of the Ilhabela Member Finally Unit F is associ ated with the Marambaia Formation shales and the turbidity flows of the Maresias Member To generate a 3D model we interpolated five horizons 1 2 3 4 and 5 and the main faults From this model important features were observed For instance the Syn-Rift I unit economic basement is deeper towards N-NW whereas it is shallower towards S-SE It occurs due to the presence of a half-grabens system of regional expression This half-graben system is responsible for conditioning the entire pre-salt geometry and thickness as the structural highs and lows generate more or less space for sediment accommodation Although the Post-Rift I unit has a predominantly regular geometry and constant thickness we noticed a tendency to thicken towards the S-SE and a slight downward flexure towards the NE in the southeast of the B zios Field in the 3D model An important observation from the 3D model is the complex morphology of the Post-Rift II unit The unit s thickness varies from zero in the NW part of the study area to 3300 m below the steep and thick domes and diapirs Moving towards the SE the unit s topography be comes more irregular where thick anticlinal and synclinal features alternate Towards the S-SE the salt layer is thicker and the domes are less steep The thickness of the Drift I unit is highly influenced by the salt morphology In areas where the salt package is thin in the north the Drift I unit is thicker reaching up to 3600 m The top surface of this unit horizon 5 is primarily flat but discontinuous due to the presence of dipslip faults Lastly the Drift II unit is characterized by a relatively con stant thickness of about 500 m with minor variations in proximity to fault zones The 3D modeling of these units allowed the observation of many features that researchers often disregarded in studies conducted in the Santos Basin Since most of these studies focus on characterizing the presalt reservoirs many morphological and structural aspects are not investigated within the rest of the basin Comparing our study area with the Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields three important differences were found the Post-Rift I layer Barra Velha Fm and the Post-Rift II package Ariri Fm are thicker and more mobilized than in the B zios Field In the Tupi Field the pre-salt blocks are more rotated and the internal reflectors have a higher inclination than in the study area The evaporite package seems less mobilized and thinner in the B zios Field area than in Sapinhoa Lapa and Tupi fields Four postulates were crucial to understanding the rifting mechanism responsible for the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean and the eastern Brazilian basins 1 the clockwise rotation of South America relative to Africa about a pole located offshore NE Brazil 2 the prop agation of rifting from south to north 3 the rifting process widened and deepened the South Atlantic basin towards the south and 4 salt mobilization maturity increases basinward Based on these premises we concluded that the increased mobilization of salt higher post-rift package thickness and increased syn-rift block rotation are associated with the relative distance from the continental margin and conse quently with the amount of displacement generated by the South Atlantic Rift Since this work modeled a unit that spatially corresponds to the Barra Velha Formation this opens up opportunities for future studies with greater detail focused on reservoir characterization With a detailed interpretation grid it is possible to model the carbonate mounds located right below the salt layer which are known to be important traps for oil accumulation Also future works can be implemented in investigating the African counterpart of the Santos Basin to search for clues that determine which rifting mechanism was responsible for the opening of the basin 6 Conclusions In this study we have characterized the B zios Field in three di mensions using 3D seismic data seismic attributes and well-log data The combined use of these tools enabled the understanding of important parameters within the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Santos Basin Specifically we examined how the relative position of the study area concerning the continental margin influences the amount of displacement observed in the region and how this positioning affects the mobilization and thickness of the salt package While most recent studies have focused on the reservoir character ization of the B zios Field our research aimed to understand how this area fits into the broader context of the evolution of the Santos Basin Through the 3D model we connected the observed features with the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the B zios Field area attempting to investigate how the opening of the rift and halokinesis impacted the current geometric and stratigraphic arrangement In an attempt to reconstruct the tectonic evolution of the Santos Basin in a regional approach the mapped units were compared to their analogs within other oil fields situated in different positions within the basin Comparing the study area with the Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields three significant features were crucial to comprehend the rifting evolution within the Santos Basin These features consist of thinner PostRift I Barra Velha Fm and Post-Rift II Ariri Fm layers and less mobilization in the B zios Field Additionally the pre-salt blocks display minor rotation and the internal reflectors demonstrate a smoother inclination in the study area when contrasted with these other fields Considering the rift mechanisms and the most widely accepted models for the opening of the South Atlantic Rift this research concludes that the reduced salt mobilization post-rift package thickness and rotation of the syn-rift blocks in the B zios Field are associated with the relative distance from the continental margin and thus the magnitude of displacement caused by the South Atlantic Rift In this context the B zios Field is positioned in closer proximity to the continental margin than the Tupi and Sapinhoa Lapa fields suggesting a lower level of displacement Declaration of generative AI in scientific

Presalt stratigraphy and depositional systems in the Kwanza Basin offshore Angola Arthur Saller Shawn Rushton Lino Buambua Kerry Inman Ross McNeil and J A D Tony Dickson ABSTRACT The Lower Cretaceous presalt section in the Kwanza Basin contains an excellent petroleum system that includes synrift strata Barremian overlain by a sag interval Aptian and capped by the Loeme Salt The upper synrift is generally limestone with widespread mollusk packstones and grainstones coquinas deposited in a fresh-to moderately saline alkaline lake The sag interval is characterized by carbonate platforms and silica-rich isolated buildups formed in highly evaporated highly alkaline lakes Shrubby dendritic microbially in uenced boundstones and intraclast spherulite grainstones accumulated in shallow water on platform tops Microbial cherts were deposited as organic buildups on large isolated structural highs basinward west of platforms and they apparently formed at low temperatures in very alkaline lake water Shrubby boundstones and microbial cherts have vuggy pores that are primary and result in high permeability Wackestones and packstones with calcitic grains mainly spherulites in dolomite or argillaceous dolomite were deposited in slightly deeper low-energy sag environments In addition clays especially stevensite precipitated out of the silica-rich highly alkaline lake waters During sag deposition calcite precipitated on the shallow lake oor with morphologies that ranged from spherulites to shrubs and included a continuum of intermediate forms Spherulites probably precipitated just below the sediment water interface Spherulites and shrubby calcites are commonly recrystallized Spherulites oating in stevensite probably formed in deeper lacustrine environments Organic-rich mudstones were deposited in even deeper lacustrine environments in synrift and sag intervals and they are likely the source of most hydrocarbons in this system These interpretations are supported by

Basins have been a focus of subsurface studies since the discovery in 2006 of large accumulations of hydrocarbons in the Early Cretaceous rift and post- rift strata below Aptian evaporites In this study regional 2D seismic lines a 3D seismic survey and well data were interpreted to reconstruct the tectono- stratigraphic evolution of the rift and post- rift stages in the northern sector of the Campos Basin Detailed 3D seismic interpretation and geological modelling were used to subdivide the pre- salt sedimentary record This revealed a diachronous strain distribution along the Guriri Fault System GFS a roughly NE- SW striking fault- bounded horst that was a focus of rift- related deformation The syn- rift succession is interpreted to be the product of two episodes of rifting RP1 and RP2 with contrasting fault activity patterns and lithostratigraphy Volcaniclastics and coarse siliciclastics of RP1 were deposited under WNW- ESE transtension that formed discontinuous half- grabens followed by extensive erosion and tectonic inversion Structurally controlled bioclastic rudstones and hybrid deposits characterize RP2 and were deposited in elongated half- grabens that delimit the GFS horst which developed under an NW- SE extension Deposition under increasingly less tectonically active transitional and post- rift stages dominated by thermal subsidence gradually led to the healing of the rift- related structural relief Selective reactivation of rift faults testifies active tectonic inversion through compression from immediate post- rift throughout evaporite deposition These interpretations are put into the context of recent geochronological data of onshore dyke emplacement and the new age constraints for the end of deposition of the pre- salt sequence Therefore we propose an earlier onset on rifting in the Campos Basin at the Berriasian KEYWORDS Campos Basin early cretaceous pre- salt rift basin sedimentation tectonics 1 I N T RO DU CT ION Several studies of

investigations on the tectono- stratigraphic evolution of the pre- salt succession and onset age of rifting To undertake the first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of tectono- stratigraphic evolution in the North of Campos Basin it is essential to 1 constrain in detail the strain distribution related to rift faults in the three- dimensional space and their influence on deposition of syn- rift sequences and 2 describe the depositional architecture and the deformation in the post- rift sequences Hence the seismic architecture of syn- rift horizons and successions is interpreted and compared with some classic publications on tectono- stratigraphy of rift basins Gawthorpe Leeder 2008 Lambiase 1990 Martins- Neto Catuneanu 2010 Morley 2002 Prosser 1993 Also studies on the Phanerozoic brittle reactivations and dyke emplacement in the adjacent onshore Precambrian basement Calegari et al 2016 Santiago et al 2020 and magmatism in the Campos Basin Almeida et al 2013 Matos 2021 are considered for a comprehensive understanding of the constraints of basin evolution Such a comprehensive approach is necessary due to the poor geochronological control for the onset of rifting The aims of this paper are to 1 Establish the geometry and kinematics of the rift- related fault framework and their later inversion 2 Describe the rift and post- rift tectono- stratigraphic framework and Highlights The tectono- stratigraphic framework of the presalt sequence is investigated The NE- SW Guriri fault system was the locus of the rift related deformation The structural and stratigraphic frameworks are the result of two phases of rifting The onset of rifting occurred during the Berriasian Inversion tectonics took place towards the end of the post- rift stage and during evaporite deposition 3 Discuss our interpretations in the face of the new time constraints for the deposition of the pre- salt succession and evaporites 2 GEOLOGICAL SETTING The Campos Basin is located in the Central Segment of the South Atlantic Ocean which includes the contiguous Esp rito Santo and Santos basins East Brazil Moulin et al 2010 These basins originated from rifting of West Gondwana during the Early Cretaceous Chang et al 1992 Rabinowitz LaBrecque 1979 and evolved as an initially magma- poor then magma- rich break- up stage Morgan et al 2020 The Central Segment exhibits some remarkable tectonic features as follows 1 southward widening of the basin margin and therefore a strong asymmetry of the necking zone and the continent ocean boundary 2 the role of the Santos and S o Paulo Plateau as a kinematic buffer between the Central and the Austral segments Moulin et al 2010 Araujo et al 2022 and 3 anomalous rifting without the expected magnitude of rift- related subsidence and which led to the development of a long- lived extensive shallow carbonate platform and the subsequent salt deposits Karner Gamb a 2007 Pietzsch et al 2018 The study area is located 70 km offshore on the continental slope of the northern part of Campos Basin The structural map of the shallow water domain of the Central Campos Basin shows major rift fault blocks bounded by alternating east- and west- dipping NNE striking normal faults which are laterally continuous for long distances up to 200 km and have throws of as much as 2500 m Guardado et al 1989a Figure 1 The rift system in the central and northern Campos Basin has its foundations in two distinctive basement units the Oriental Terrane of the Ribeira Belt and the Cabo Frio Tectonic Domain CFTD Schmitt et al 2008 STRUGALE and CARTWRIGHT Stanton et al 2019 The former is constituted by low- P high- T Neoproterozoic para- and ortho- derived gneisses intruded by several magmatic bodies with high- angle NE- SW fabrics generated under a right- lateral transpressional regime as a result of polyphase amalgamation from ca 650 500 Ma The CFTD mainly comprises Paleoproterozoic orthogneisses 2 0 1 94 Ga tectonically interleaved with medium to high T- P Neoproterozoic para- derived gneisses both migmatized The metamorphism and coeval ductile structures developed between 550 and 490 Ma due to a collisional event called the B zios Orogeny Schmitt et al 2004 The CFTD has a predominantly low- angle NW- SE to N- S structural grain orthogonal to the adjacent Oriental Terrane Schmitt et al 2004 2016 Two sets of fractures and dyke swarms striking NW to NNW transverse to the basement metamorphic grain in the onshore basement have their offshore projections close to the study area Almeida et al 2021 the NNW- SSE Vit ria- Colatina lineament Chang et al 1992 and the Pi ma Itaoca Castelo lineaments Louren o et al 2016 Santiago et al 2020 Figure 1 In common these structures demonstrate a polyphase evolution with alkaline dykes being emplaced during the Cambrian and tholeiitic dykes in the Early Cretaceous age see age compilation in Pessano et al 2021 The dykes are interpreted as the result of the orogenic collapse of the EAGE 1657 Ara ua Belt during the Cambrian and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean during Early Cretaceus respectively Therefore they show recurrent episodes of brittle deformation of which precise timing and kinematic relations remain unclear Calegari et al 2016 Louren o et al 2016 Santiago et al 2020 A relative tectonically quiescent period of more than 300 Myr followed the B zios Orogeny From the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous prior to the South Atlantic Ocean opening several magmatic events were recorded in the region of Western Gondwana in which the Campos Basin formed In the present- day onshore basement domain early Cretaceous dykes along the Vit ria- Colatina lineament yield Ar Ar ages ranging 136 128 Ma and were emplaced under slightly dextral oblique extension Almeida et al 2013 The Castelo dyke swarm reveals a U Pb Concordia age of 141 1 9 Ma Santiago et al 2020 Both dyke swarms have geochemical signatures and ages similar to other Upper Jurassic Lower Cretaceous dyke swarms of the Brazilian coast Almeida et al 2013 and to the basalt floods of the Paran - Etendeka Large Igneous Province LIP of which ages ranges

taking place to collect information about geology and the reservoirs characteristics to consequently improve production results Seismic interpretation is mandatory to understand the geology always thinking about reducing all the risks during exploration Seismic and well data are commonly used together as a way to comprehend geological history and provide a good reservoir characterization In this paper we performed the seismic interpretation on presalt carbonate reservoirs of B zios Field within the isopach maps strategy and TecVA attribute As results we achieved better definition of faults distribution and tectonics behavior determined the main interval thickness and the possibility of coquina banks occurrence Introduction Formation Both formations are important presalt exploration targets and have quite different sedimentarytectonic contexts The objective of this work is to understand the evolution of the rift and sag phases in the B zios Field area through the integration of well and seismic data This article intends to collaborate for a better understanding of the paleoenvironments of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations We interpreted four important unconformities in the presalt zone i Economic basement ii Jiqui -Buracica unconformity separates Pi arras from Itapema Formations iii Pr -Alagoas unconformity the top of coquina deposits and acts dividing the Itapema from Lower Barra Velha Formations and iv the Base of Salt Geological Setting The Santos Basin is located on the southeastern Brazilian margin bounded by the Campos Basin at the North and the Pelotas Basin at the South Santos Basin is one of the most extensive offshore Brazilian basins with an area of 352 000 km and a current water depth of up to 3 000 m The main structural features are the Cabo Frio High to the Northeast and the Florian polis Platform to the Southwest the Santos hinge line to the west which marks the external western limit of the salt Ariri Formation and the S o Paulo plateau to the East The B zios Field is located at the Santos Basin Figure 1 The Santos Basin represents the largest presalt exploration and production area in Brazil It currently accounts for more than 70 of the country s oil and gas production ANP 2021 In this context the B zios Field is considered a super-giant field with an estimated volume in place of 3 058 million bbl of oil equivalent and in January 2021 the outstanding result of 146 524 Bbl d was achieved by the platform with the highest oil production in the country located in B zios Field The carbonate sedimentation processes are extremely sensitive to climatic factors hydrodynamics basin tectonics and morphology These differences might cause vertical and lateral heterogeneity effects in seismic facies Porta 2015 In the Santos Basin the main reservoirs are found inner coquinas a type of sedimentary rock composed mainly by shells and their fragments of the Itapema Formation Castro 2019 and in the spherulitic laminate shrubs and reworked facies of the Barra Velha Formation Gomes et al 2020 Castro 2019 showed that the Itapema Formation in the B zios Field is less influenced by the presence of fines and has better permeabilities than the Barra Velha Figure 1 - B zios Field Location adapted from ANP 2016 According to Moreira et al 2007 the geological history of the Santos Basin can be divided into three phases Rift Post-rift and Drift The Rift phase presents extension efforts of separation between the South American and African plates which started from the Lower Cretaceous Muniz and Bosence 2015 describe that the sequence of tectonic events that caused the fragmentation of Gondwana would have started from the stretching and thinning process of the continental crust triggering a Seventeenth International Congress of the Brazilian Geophysical Society SEISMIC INTERPRETATION IN PRESALT RESERVOIRS 2 rifting process This fragmentation consisted of a mixed process controlled by lithospheric stretching and thermal anomalies The crystalline basement of the Santos Basin generated in the context of Gondwana s amalgamation is characterized by granites and gneisses of pre-Cambrian age of the Coastal Complex and metasediments of the Ribeira Strip Moreira et al 2007 During the main rifting process around 145 Ma the Northwest portion remained closed while a wedge was extended to the south along the east of South America Szatmari and Milani 2016 According to the authors volcanism would have been absent where the lithosphere was thick An important consequence during the Rift Phase was the space-forming mechanism for sedimentary accommodation in an extensional tectonic setting and widespread normal faults generation due to mechanical subsidence process besides causing reactivation of faults in the Precambrian basement Mohriak 2008 Strugale et al 2021 point out that the different basement compositions represent another determining factor for the way the rifting process takes place Where the basement is heterogeneous the pre-existing fabric was reactivated whenever its orientation was favorable producing faults as the extension direction rotates whereas low to very low angle basement fabric were cross-cut by rift faults Where the basement was homogeneous and more stable only the previous formed faults remain active throughout the rifting Another effect observed was the contribution and influence of thermal anomalies in the region of the Santos Basin which would have been responsible for inducing the strain softening process since the beginning of the rift leading to the development of uplifted areas ANP LEBAC 2003 The importance of understanding the different processes related to the rifting phase is the influence during the deposition of the overlying sedimentary layers The rift super-sequence is composed of continental siliciclastics talc-stevensite ooids with interbedded lacustrine coquinas and organic-rich shales of the Pi arras and Itapema formations consisting of essentially continental sediments Szatmari and Milani 2016 Furthermore during the Rift Phase the sediments from the bottom of the Barra Velha Formation were deposited Buckley et al 2015 These deposits show a prominent wedge geometry which may represent differences in the faults movement rate that consequently created space for accommodation Thus they state that this may represent an increase in the sedimentation rate at the top of the Barra Velha Formation when compared to the Pi arras and Itapema formations The post-rift sequence also known as the sag phase is represented by the Upper Barra Velha Formation which is characterized by shrubs spherulite laminate and reworked facies Gomes et al 2020 precipitated nonmarine carbonate successions Wright Barnett 2015 The absence of unambiguous palaeoecologically significant fossils together with the presence of the mineral stevensite rather than marine-derived evaporates sulphates and chlorides indicates an alkaline lacustrine setting with a volcanic source area Wright Barnett 2015 In short the presalt reservoir rocks are in the Itapema and Barra Velha formations The Itapema Formation is represented by grainstones to bivalves coquinas wackestones and bioclastic packstones carbonate shales and dark shales rich in organic matter which sometimes also work as source rocks The Barra Velha Formation is composed of carbonates deposited in lacustrine environment with a multiplicity of facies from boundstones and grainstones to mudstones The Itapema Formation is limited at the bottom by the Jiqui Buracica unconformity 126 4 Ma and at the top by the Pr -Alagoas unconformity while the Barra Velha Formation is limited at the bottom by the Pr Alagoas unconformity and at the top by the Base of Salt Moreira et al 2007 Seismic Interpretation The seismic data provides information about the regional context depositional system tectonic history and allows inferring geological features and heterogeneities favoring better understanding of sedimentary basins The interpretation of seismic reflection terminations such as onlap downlap toplap and erosive truncations are the main criteria for the recognition of stratigraphic units Figure 2 They are essential to better understand what happened allowing to foresee the current geological behavior Then the identification of seismic parameters was made to recognize information about the depositional environment source of sediments and the geological context in which the seismic facies were deposited For this study we used a PSDM volume post-stacked depth migration and applied a structural smoothing filter to remove part of migration smile noises Data from 15 wells Figure 3 helped in the seismic interpretation from the identification of the boundaries between the lithostratigraphic units Previous works were also fundamental for a better understanding of the sedimentary-tectonic history of the study area Seventeenth International

boundaries of stratigraphic units possible erosion especially in the region at east of the F1 fault which caused a strong slope in the strata We also visualized the amount of onlap markings in yellow present mainly in the region of a build-up to the east the horizontal strata that end in an inclined surface being in this case a possible build-up This onlap configuration is very present in places with faults that were generated during the rifting process which has influence on the formation of accommodation space and generation of wedges in the synrift interval red and light blue arrows Figure 2 Figure 3 - Grid of the Base of Salt - B zios Field Wells in black dots AA is the interpreted crossline In carbonate rocks due to the high heterogeneity of these rocks the integration of well and seismic data is essential for the reservoir characterization The steps used to develop this work are shown in Figure 4 Figure 4 - Workflow used in this work We recognize on Figure 2 the erosional truncations in blue as reflectors that end on an upper surface results of We interpreted the Economic Basement as a high amplitude reflector due to the high amplitude contrast of the basalts with the siliciclastic deposits of the Pi arras Fm The TecVA attribute Bulh es and Amorim 2005 helped during the interpretation of the basement This attribute was co-rendering with the seismic amplitude and allowed to improve the characterization of the seismic facies below the basement which is characterized as chaotic of low amplitude In addition TecVa also highlighted the faults of the presalt section Figure 5-b The typical pattern of the basement is the absence of internal reflections or the presence of chaotic reflections We noticed that the presalt interval in the B zios Field has horst-graben systems characteristic of extensional basins Figure 6 The faults are very consistent along the entire rift These two aspects have influence on geological sedimentation and the faults might act as fluid conductors throughout the sections In the study area the fault orientation is N-S and can reach up to 2 km of reject In the syn-rift segment we observed medium to low amplitude reflectors with subparallel and wavy configurations of medium continuity and low frequency representing deposits of clastic sediments of the Pi arras Formation The next unconformity interpreted was Jiqui Buracica to delimitate the lower Itapema Formation The coquinas have been interpreted as lacustrine deposits located at structural highs deposited under shallow and high-energy conditions Figure 6 The Itapema Formation presented progradational to chaotic seismic facies during Seventeenth International Congress of the Brazilian Geophysical Society SEISMIC INTERPRETATION IN PRESALT RESERVOIRS 4 seismic interpretation Debris flow were also identified according to seismic reflection terminations added to the amplitude information possible result of the fragmented configuration due to rifting process In the Pr -Alagoas unconformity interpretation it was possible to observe higher amplitudes within planeparallel seismic facies The Barra Velha Formation is also subdivided into upper and lower Barra Velha where the lower one is affected by a rifting characteristic tectonic regime and is described by reworked facies with rudstones and grainstones being the prevailing facies Silva et al 2014 The upper one beneath the salt shows a predominance of flat arrangement in situ facies portraying a sag phase tectonic quiescence Because of this aspect the layers are displayed stable We recognized the transition between lake bottom patterns of the upper rift phase passing upward to aggradational progradational carbonate platform during the sag phase indicating distal facies at the base of the sequence which can be attributed to the fault development in the region during the Barra Velha Formation It is possible to visualize in the Figure 6 that the coquina bank is limited by two normal faults F1 and F2 sectioning the coquina bank in the central part of a structural high As can be seen between faults F2 and F3 Figure 6 the thickness of the Barra Velha Formation was increased which was caused by the faulting and horst and graben configuration especially in high regions We point out this effect as accommodation space creation The Sag phase is assigned as a period of tectonic quiescence However we can notice faults that reach the Base of Salt Figure 6 leading to the discussion about the presence of some tectonic activity in this period Figure 5 - Original Seismic A and

Carbonate build-ups probably controlled by hydrothermal activity at the edge of high structural faults and isolated at high locations Facies of platform carbonate sedimentation controlled by topography and bathymetry presenting aggradational or progradational character Extensive carbonate parallel architecture Debris flow to the right of F3 correlated to the tectonics platforms with plane- The carbonate mounds are often recognized presenting an internal low-amplitude reflectors behavior with great possibility to be an excellent reservoir Jesus et al 2019 Ferreira et al 2021 The build-ups display aggradational geometries that are onlapped and overlain by evaporates Figure 2 Above the Barra Velha Formation during the Neoaptian the evaporites of the Ariri Formation were deposited The base of the salt has a high amplitude characteristic and acts as the hydrocarbon seal at the region Isopachs An isopach map provides information on a geological horizon while combined with other geological information enables the geologist to interpret the activity and the history of this layer and its time segment An isopach map focuses on a special horizon and allows thickness analysis Based on the isopach maps Figure 7 we analyzed the thickness of each reservoir interval Itapema and Barra Velha formations and thus better understand their deposition phases over time which is characterized as an important step for future modeling To the southeast we see a thickness increase of the Barra Velha Formation Figure 7a with mounds improving permoporous characteristics due to the large dip-slip faults At this location the creation of accommodation space was very high The Figure 7b displays a thickness increase at the central part of Itapema Formation at the same place where was possible to observe coquina bank restricted to the highs between the main faults Szatmari and Milani 2016 also point out that there is an increase in the occurrence of oil reserves at the south of Santos Basin According to the authors the main reasons for this are the increase of generator rocks amount to the south with the widening and deepening of the rift This increase was displayed in Figure 7 Conclusions i Evidence of faults affecting the upper rift and sag sections in the location of section AA indicates that tectonic activity is at least locally controlling the sag phase sedimentation in some segments of the B zios Field ii Coquinas with good permoporous properties towards the top of Itapema Formation are also associated with structural highs influenced by faults acting as controllers iii The thickness of the Barra Velha Formation increases along the section due to geological behavior and tectonic activity We observe that the greatest thickness of the reservoir interval is located on the structural highs of the rift phase indicating more favorable environmental conditions for the development of carbonate facies Figure 7- Isopachs showing the

Abstract Santos Basin is located in the southeast of the Brazilian continental margin and was created by rifting processes during the Gondwana break up and opening of the South Atlantic initiated in the Neocomian Cretaceous The area gained renewed attention from the oil industry due to recent Petrobras huge discoveries of carbonate reservoirs below the salt layer Pre-salt The discovery of this new play in deep and ultra-deep water opened a new exploratory frontier in Brazil generating excellent economic prospects for the country The case study of this work is the Lapa Field discovered in 2007 by Petrobras which is located in deep water and represents one of the largest producing fields of the Pre-salt This research aims to improve the actual model for the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the Pre-salt section on the Santos Basin Brazil The used database includes the public data provided by National Petroleum Agency ANP six post-stack 2D seismic lines migrated in time and four wells Main Pre-salt horizons and faults were mapped considering the Exxon Model to do the seismic-stratigraphy interpretation A velocity model was constructed for the Lapa field which enable the generation of isopach maps All these products allow a better visualization of the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the region and also show the salt thickness variation analyzing the reason of its behavior Keywords Pre-salt Lapa Field Santos Basin Seismicstratigraphy interpretation Velocity model 1 Introduction The discovery of large oil accumulations in deepwater offshore in the section below the salt opens a new exploratory frontier The presence of this new play has generated great economic prospects for Brazil which would mean reducing its energy dependence and make the country one of the world s largest producers of oil and gas Riccomini et al 2012 In order to know more about the huge sub-salt discoveries the interest in understanding the origin and evolution of the marginal basins with the purpose of improve the tectonostratigraphic evolution model of this section in the Field is increasing This involves not only sedimentation siliciclastic evaporite and carbonate but also tectonic movement accommodation space creation and climate changes The main objective of this work is to analyze the isopach maps generated for the Pre-salt section of the Lapa Field with the purpose of improve the tectonostratigraphic evolution model of this section and understand the salt behavior in this field 133 Journal of Sedimentary Environments Published by Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro 2 2 133-148 April-August 2017 doi 10 12957 jse 2017 30052 RESEARCH PAPER The Santos Basin located in the southern part of the Brazilian offshore continental margin is limited to the north by the Cabo Frio High separating it from Campos Basin and to the south by the Florian polis High and Florian polis Fracture Zone FFZ which separates it from Pelotas Basin Contreras et al 2010 It is a prolific area being one of the most exploratory basins In 2007 Petrobras discovered in the Santos Basin a new exploratory play in deep and ultradeep waters with a great economic accumulation of excellent quality oil Lula Sapinho and Lapa Fields and Libra Carcar and Jupiter discoveries The high exploratory success rate of this type of reservoir can be justified due to a competent petroleum system with excellent values of porosity and permeability of the carbonate reservoir It can be linked to the source rock and the efficient seal of the salt layer Chang et al 2008 According to information from the National Petroleum Agency at the Monthly Bulletin of May 2017 ANP 2017 the Pre-salt represents today 1 572 Mboe d and it means 47 5 of the total produced in Brazil The Lapa Field production describes 3 of this Pre-salt total with 52 906 boe d from 3-BRSA-861-SPS and 7-LPA-1D-SPS wells Because of this the studied of the Pre-salt in the Lapa Field are extremely relevant and have high scientific industrial and financial interest Along with this there are not many works published on the subject The Santos Basin is developed on a geological context of the breakup of Gondwana associated with the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean White and Mckenzie 1989 The start of the rupture occurred by the south of the Supercontinent and it is linked to lithospheric stretching and thermal anomalies hotspots phenomena Fig 1 In addition to this initial pole of rupture between South America and Africa there were other two well-known hotspots in the area The first one was located below the actual Santos Basin called Trist o da Cunha hotspot White and Mckenzie 1989 which allowed that part of the continental crust has become more ductile and less resistant to stretch Pereira and Macedo 1990 This led to the formation of a wider range of crustal thinning known as S o Paulo Plateau Trist o da Cunha thermal anomaly also allowed the initial formation of the Rio Grande and Walvis volcanic chains White and Mckenzie 1989 two prominent features that form the symmetrical axis of the seafloor spreading Vidal et al 2003 The second hot spot was developed later in northeast of Brazil St Helena hot spot and is related to the rifting processes and marine incursions in this region Wilson 1992 Fig 1 Gondwana breakup stages from rifting process until the completely ruptured forming the Mid Oceanic Ridge Red circles indicate the influence zone of Trist o da Cunha and St Helena hotspots Modified from Beasley et al 2010 The study basin is classified as a Passive Margin basin type and can be subdivided into three depositional supersequences including the rift post-rift and drift phases Moreira et al 2007 The Pre-salt section is formed by the rift and post-rift phases Rift supersequence is composed by Camboriu Pi arras and Itapema Formations with sedimentary records between the Hauterivian and Eoaptian Ages and Post-rift supersequence is composed by Barra Velha and Ariri Formations with a sedimentary record deposited during the Aptian Moreira et al 2007 The Camboriu Formation marks the beginning of the rifting process in the basin and represents the economic basement with basaltic dyke swarms The Pi arras Formation is formed by siliciclastic sediments with conglomerates and sandstones in the proximal portions and lamination of talc-stevensite composition and dark shales organic matter rich in the most 134 Journal of Sedimentary Environments Published by Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro 2 2 133-148 April-August 2017 doi 10 12957 jse 2017 30052 RESEARCH PAPER distal portions The Itapema Formation marks the end of the Rift stage in the basin and is characterized by calcirrudites with dolomitized Pelecypoda shells coquinas fragments and dark shales organic matter rich intercalations The Barra Velha Formation marks the beginning of the Post-rift phase in the basin with the first marine incursions and consists of microbial limestones and stromatolites talc and magnesium clays rich in the proximal portions and carbonate shales in the distal portions Moreira et al 2007 The Ariri Formation marks the end of the Post-rift phase and is characterized by evaporites composed essentially of halite and anhydrite and less commonly by tachydrite carnallite and sylvinite This salt layer can reach significant thicknesses of 2000m to 2500m Pereira and Macedo 1990 and is conditioned by two factors that provided the ideal conditions for this salt basins the alignment of the Florian polis High Dorsal de S o Paulo and Rio Grande Elevation seafloor structures that blocked the circulation of the Atlantic Ocean already existing in the south Pelotas Basin and the dry and hot climate prevailing in that time Demercian 1996 Regarding the geodynamic evolution of the salt basins Cainelli and Mohriak 1998 characterized five main stages Fig 2 The first phase is marked by the beginning of extentional process with the asthenospheric uplift and lithospheric underlining due a thermal anomaly Fig 2-I the second phase is marked by the increase of the lithospheric stretching with tectonic activity of faults that control the local depocenters blocks rotation of continental flood basalts and formation of half-grabens Fig 2-II The midAtlantic Ridge was and is still responsible for the creation of oceanic crust that probably began to be formed at the end of the rift episodes The third phase is associated with continental and oceanic volcanism the reactivation of principal faults and erosion of the rift blocks due a regional erosive discordance between the rift and post-rift sections breakup unconformity Fig 2-III The fourth phase is marked by the first localized marine incursion and corresponds to the Aptian carbonate deposition culminating with salt deposition at the top of the post-rift sequence Fig 2-IV The fifth phase represents the passive margin phase already in the free marine zone with the formation of a shallow Albian carbonaceous platform progressively replaced by siliciclastic sequences with the increase of accommodation space and the influx of sediments Fig 2-V 1 1 Study area The Santos Basin is located in the southeast of the Brazilian continental margin It is limited on north by the Cabo Frio High bordering with Campos Basin on south by Florian polis High bordering with Pelotas Basin and extends to east to the S o Paulo Plateau boundary Fig 3 This basin is exclusively offshore with approximately 350 000 km2 Fig 2 Geodynamic model of Passive Margin Basins according to Cainelli and Mohriak 1998 Lapa Field target of this work is located in the central portion of the Santos Basin Fig 4 This is the third Pre-salt field put into production in Santos Basin after Lula and Sapinho fields Fig 4 Initially when discovered by Petrobras in 2007 this field was named as Carioca area but with the commercial declaration submitted to ANP in December 2013 this name was changed to Lapa Field going into production on December 2016 The field s production potential was estimated at 28 000 boe d through a long- 135 Journal of Sedimentary Environments Published by Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro

recoverable volume estimated at 459 Mboe according to Petrobras Fig 3 Santos Basin location map Dotted and dashed lines represent important ocean floor structural features FFZ Florian polis Fracture Zone Modified from Contreras et al 2010 units A B C D and E were identified based on the seismic reflection configuration Severiano Ribeiro 2001 Fig 6 To aid map the main events attributes were used to facilitate the recognition of patterns and highlight the desired structures unconformities faults fractures Conceptually seismic attributes are transformations and or mathematical manipulations of the original data in order to improve geological characteristics that would not previously be detected It is possible change the phase frequency seismic trace or amplitude of the data depending on the objective The amplitude of attributes used in this work were the Technique Volume Amplitudes TecVA and Sweetness The phase-rotated TecVA is a volumetric attribute generated from the Hilbert inverse transform Bulh es and Amorim 2005 resulting of the compilation of three volume attributes RMS Amplitude Remove Bias and Phase Shift in the software Petrel 2015 It highlights the high impedance contrasts that are empirically given by differences in lithologies different velocities and was applied in this work to identify discontinuities and faults Sweetness is derived from a mathematical formula that divides the instantaneous amplitude intensity by the square root of the instantaneous frequency It is usually used to map channels or bodies of sand into shales when there is a significant difference in acoustic impedance In this work Sweetness was used to delimit the top of the basement and for well-defined faults 2 Materials and Methods In the present work six post-stack 2D seismic in time domain PSTM and four exploratory wells were supplied by the National Petroleum Agency ANP Fig 5 Although the four wells composite logs were analyzed looking at the lithology description and petrophysics curves only two wells could be tied due the greater proximity of the seismic lines The project was done in Petrel 2015 software The workflow for this project includes the seismic stratigraphy interpretation of the PSTM seismic lines with the proper well-tie and the velocity model build that allowed the generation of the isopach maps 2 1 Seismic-stratigraphy interpretation Horizons chosen to map during this work are the main ones of the Pre-salt section top salt Top of the Ariri Formation - Fm base salt top of the Barra Velha Fm top rift top of Itapema Fm top intra-rift top of Pi arras Fm and top basement They were identified considering the continuity amplitude and reflector termination when possible In addition major faults were mapped Five seismic

interpretation two wells with the respective seismic line 1-BRSA-491-SPS with the seismic line VB99-186 and 3-BRSA-1023-SPS with the seismic line VB99-188 were tied 136 Journal of Sedimentary Environments Published by Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro 2 2 133-148 April-August 2017 doi 10 12957 jse 2017 30052 RESEARCH PAPER The procedure to perform the well-tie consists of three steps White and Simm 2003 a edit and calibrate the sonic profile DT b construct the synthetic seismogram using well-calibrated well profiles with a wavelet and c tie the synthetic seismogram to the actual seismic section The calibration of the DT profile consists of analyzing and correcting the anomalous velocity values from the well checkshot With this it is possible to have a better stabilization of the time-depth values measured along the well The synthetic seismogram in this case considered the seismic response in the well was constructed from the convolution of the reflectivity coefficient with the Ricker wavelet seismic pulse with frequency of 25Hz Finally the synthetic seismogram is tied with seismic trace anchoring the corresponding events This generates the interval velocities that will be used in the velocity model build 2 2 Velocity Model The velocity modeling is responsible for enable seismic data migrated in time to be converted to the depth domain time-depth conversion To be considered a close representation of the subsurface a depth seismic section need to be converted from a velocity-depth model sufficiently accurate Yilmaz 2001 With depth seismic it is possible to analyze the thickness and depth of the layers having more geological interpretation of the area In this work the velocity model was made only for the south-central part of the Lapa Field due to greater amount of available data well-tie and horizons interpreted To build the velocity model surfaces in time extrapolation of the mapped horizons were created considering a polygon defined by the interpreter In this case a polygon was drawn close to the Lapa Field as the extension of the seismic lines is large and the well-tied well is inside the field If these surfaces were generated by connecting the seismic lines boundaries the coverage area would be very large and the reliability of the velocity model would be low For the velocity model build were used as inputs the surfaces in time and the well-tops defined and the velocities for the 1-BRSA-491-SPS well These velocities were defined based on the interval velocities obtained from points of the well-tie The velocity for the Pi arras Fm and basement were estimated based on literature since the well 1-BRSA-491-SPS did not reach these formations Fig 5 2D seismic lines and wells composing the database Zoom

Isopach maps The isopach maps represent sedimentary thicknesses and were constructed in Petrel 2015 software from the difference between two surfaces already converted to depth by the velocity model The products generated in this step are isopach maps of the Lower and Upper Rift Sequence and Lower and Upper Pos-rift Sequence From the seismic horizons mapped it was possible individualize five seismic units Tab 2 A B C D and E respectively interpreted as basement Lower Rift Sequence Upper Rift Sequence Lower Pos-rift Sequence and Upper Pos-rift Sequence During the seismic-stratigraphy interpretation faults were observed reaching the seismic horizon H4 interpreted as the base salt Fig 8 Through the composite logs available by ANP it is possible to observe that the base salt is basically composed by anhydrite This mineral has a brittle behavior due a high density around 2 9 g cm-3 compared to halite Tab 1 Interpreted horizons and their characterization Horizon H1 Characteristics Positive discontinuous reflector with varied amplitude Difficult mapping interface identified using Sweetness attribute As the seismic wave energy is absorbed as the depth increases there is not a great contrast between lithologies allowing generate a large variation of acoustic impedance and creating a well-marked reflector Positive discontinuous reflector with medium amplitude intensely failures Interpretation Top basement H3 Positive reflector with high amplitude Discontinuous in some parts due to the occurrence of faults Top Rift Top Itapema Fm H4 Well marked positive continuous reflector with high amplitude Presence of a basal layer of anhydrite that at some points is cut by reactivated faults Fig 8 The anhydrite has a higher seismic velocity and density than the overlapped halite characterizing a high contrast of acoustic impedance It loses resolution at the base of large salt diapirs impairing interpretation Very well marked positive continuous reflector with high amplitude Intensely deformed because of the halokinesis Base Salt Top Barra Velha Fm H2 Fig 6 Seismic reflection configuration pattern Modified from Mitchum et al 1977 3 Results and Discussion 3 1 Seismic Units In this study targeting the Pre-salt section the main five seismic horizons were mapped Fig 7 H1 H2 H3 H4 and H5 respectively interpreted as top basement top intra-rift top Pi arras Fm top rift top Itapema Fm base salt top Barra Velha Fm and top salt top Ariri Fm Tab 1 The seafloor was mapped only for control The top intra-rift horizon is considered a flood surface into the rift phase based on 1BRSA-491-SPS and 3-BRSA-861-SPS gamma ray pattern Among these Pre-salt horizons the base salt and top rift is the more reliable since they were tied with wells

the seismic unit D using the TecVA attribute it is possible to observe a restricted acoustic impedance contrast at the base of the sequence seismic signature characteristic of igneous rocks in relation to the sedimentary layers igneous rocks have high seismic velocities Vp 5-7 km s -1 This can be interpreted as saucer-shaped bodies or lopoliths Fig 9 With the 2D data available it was not possible to define the diameter and thickness of this igneous body only the record of it Tab 2 Characterization of the mapped seismic facies Seismic facies Characteristics Interpretation A Top H1 top basement Chaotic or transparent seismic facies with faults some reaching the base salt Fig 9 Basement B Base H1 top basement Top H2 top intra-rift Prograding or divergent seismic facies indicating creation of accommodation space Intense failures due to high tectonic activity Base H2 top intra-rift Top H3 top rift Even parallel to subparallel seismic facies at some points and divergent in others Growth failures mapped indicating deposition was syntectonic Lower Rift Sequence Pi arras Fm Base H3 top rift Top H4 base salt Even parallel seismic facies with plane-parallel reflectors indicating a agradational process Cut by a few faults reach the base salt due to the anhydrite reptile behavior Fig 8 Base H4 base salt Top H5 top salt Transparent seismic facies massive salt and in some parts even parallel seismic facies stratified salt Intensely deformed The presence of this distinct configuration regular parallel is consequence of the acoustic impedance contrasts variations generated by different evaporite deposition stages Fig 10 Lower Pos-rift Sequence Barra Velha Fm C D E Different seismic reflection configurations were observed in the seismic unit E Transparent seismic facies interpreted as massive salt are present in the salt diapirs while the parallel even seismic facies interpreted as stratified salt are present in the lower parts of the salt structures Fig 10 With the PSTM seismic lines analysis it is possible to notice that there is a lateral compartmentation of the stratified salt in relation to the massive salt it seems that there is an interdigitation of the layers In addition with halokinesis halite due to a plastic behavior cut the evaporate deposition layers forming thickness diapirs 3 2 Velocity Model The velocity model was well consistent with acceptable velocities for the sequences and the depth converted surfaces coincide with the well tops in the well area Fig 11 Despite this the velocities for above the salt Pi arras Fm and basement were estimated based on the literature because there are no points tied to the well 3 3 Basement map The basement surface map was generated as shown in figure 12 In this one we observe a depth structure to SW Upper Rift Sequence Itapema Fm Upper Pos-rift Sequence Ariri Fm apparently controlled by a WNW-ESE structure and it is also possible notice a higher zone in the center region of the map a basement high 3 4 Isopach Maps Based on the isopach maps it is possible to analyze the thickness of the mapped sequences in seismic and thus better understand their deposition phases over time Thickness maps were constructed for the south-center portion of the Lapa Field Fig 13 from the same polygon of the time surfaces used as input for the velocity model The main products generated as isopach maps are Lower Fig 14 and Upper Rift Sequence Fig 15 and Lower Fig 16 and Upper Pos-Rift Sequence Fig 17 3 5 Tectono-stratigraphic evolution From the generated maps it was possible to observe that the basement surface Fig 12 and the isopach map of the Lower Rift Sequence Fig 14 are similar In this first evolution stage the basement controls the sedimentary deposition through a WNW-ESE main structure causing a greater sedimentary thickness in the SW portion of the Lapa Field location of the main rift at that time 139 Journal of Sedimentary Environments Published by Universidade do Estado

sedimentation phase of the coquinas the tectonic is still active although with less intensity and there is a displacement of the main rift depocenter to SE with new structures controlling its deposition In the thickness map of the Lower Post-rift Sequence of Santos Basin Fig 16 there is a significant change in the unit thickness The thickness variation in the region as a whole is 200 m 50 m to 240 m indicating that the basin begins to get flat Finally in the isopach map of the Upper Pos-rift Sequence Fig 17 it is possible to notice the basin restructuring caused by the intense halokinesis The larger salt thicknesses are Fig 13 Isopach maps location in the south-central portion of the Lapa Field Upper Pos-rift Sequence represented in the map 144 Journal of Sedimentary

these faults propagate in the salt or effectively end at the base salt The Rift Sequences isopach maps show a displacement of the main rift depocenter in the region of the Lapa Field from SW to SE controlled by new structures This change of the depocenter during the rift stage may have caused by a perturbation in the petroleum system of the region more specifically in the migration process With the variation of the structural control of the area there were probably a change of direction in the faults that act as conduits for the oil transport Fig 14 Lower Rift Sequence isopach map The evaporites of Ariri Fm in the area are composed mainly by halite and anhydrite analyzing the wells composite logs available by ANP Anhydrite exhibits a more brittle behavior while the halite has a more ductile behavior As the salt deforms the halite can be more plastic flowing better and reaches larger thicknesses forming the huge salt diapirs Where there are cycles of anhydrite deposition stratified salt the behavior of the salt in the deformation front changes not being so intense With this the salt structures do not present such significant thicknesses Greater amount of anhydrite means smaller thickness of the salt The deformation of the salt is also controlled by external factors of differential burial gravitational instabilities de Melo Garcia et al 2012 and tectonics In figure 18 it is possible to observe the different salt behaviors justified by the mineralogical composition variation The tectono-stratigraphic evolution shown by isopach maps corroborates the current Pre-salt model described in the literature Papaterra 2010 Riccomini et al 2012 There is a first phase of sedimentation rift stage with intense tectonic activity and a second phase of sedimentation Post-rift stage with less tectonic activity because it is a transitional environment changing from a continental to shallow marine environment which allowed the deposition of the evaporites at the end As reported in seismic units A and D Tab 1 and 2 there were faults mapped reaching the base salt composed by anhydrite - more brittle and they disappear inside the salt Because of the characteristically transparent seismic signature Fig 15 Upper Rift Sequence isopach map 4 Conclusion From the seismic-stratigraphy interpretation and well tie it was possible to map six Pre-salt main seismic horizons H1 H2 H3 H4 and H5 respectively interpreted as the top basement top intra-rift top rift base salt and top salt They are positive regional reflectors that individualize the seismic units Five seismic units were identified based on the seismic reflection configuration A B C D and E Briefly seismic unit A interpreted as Basement presents chaotic sismofacies with some faults reaching the top of seismic unit D the seismic unit B interpreted as the Lower Rift Sequence shows prograding to divergent sismofacies due to the space creation during the rifting process the seismic unit C interpreted as Upper Rift Sequence shows parallel even and divergent sismofacies with the presence of growth faults indicating that the deposition was still syntectonic the seismic unit D interpreted as the 145 Journal of Sedimentary Environments Published by Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro 2 2 133-148 April-August 2017 doi 10 12957 jse 2017 30052 RESEARCH PAPER Lower Pos-rift Sequence presents parallel even sismofacies and represents an agradational process with little faults reactivation and the seismic unit E interpreted as Upper Posrift Sequence presents mainly transparent sismofacies massive salt with some parts individualizing a laminar parallel configuration justified by the presence of stratified salt in the salt structures Fig 17 Upper Pos-rift Sequence isopach map Fig 16 Lower Pos-rift Sequence isopach map Building the velocity model for the Lapa field region it was possible to generate the isopach maps of the Lower and Upper Rift Sequences and the Lower and Upper Pos-rift Sequences With these maps it was possible to analyze the tectonostratigraphic evolution of the Pre-salt section starting with a rift phase with greater sedimentary thickness to a time when it starts to get flat Barra Velha Fm finishing with the salt deposition Halokinesis made the framework for the drift section deposition on the basin Some aspects of the Pre-salt section evolution were differently detailed in relation to the current model identified faults that reach the proposed base salt displacement of depocenter during the rift phase and also the lateral variation of the salt layers composition from massive to stratified Due to the seismic quality and the plastic salt behavior it was not possible to identify the propagation of the faults that cut the base salt composed by basal anhydrite according to well data Thus the question is whether they reach only the base or propagate through the salt If these also cut the salt perhaps the evaporites do not behave as a perfect seal as it has been considered in the literature In this way the present work is based on the data interpretation for the south-central region of the Lapa Field in order to improve the understanding of the tectonostratigraphic evolution and salt behavior for the area Acknowledgment The authors are grateful to Ag ncia Nacional do Petr leo G s Natural e Biocombust veis - ANP for the

major research interest The huge extension and volume and unusual textural and compositional features are key elements for understanding the tectonic structural stratigraphic and sedimentological generation and early evolution of the region as well as potentially of other lacustrine carbonate systems A systematic petrographic and petrophysical study has been performed on the Lower Cretaceous lacustrine carbonate reservoirs from northern Campos Basin Offshore Brazil in order to unravel the main controls on the origin and evolution of pore systems The main lithologic types recognized in the rift section are bivalve gastropod grainstones and rudstones arenites constituted by ooids of syngenetic magnesian clay minerals mostly stevensite and dolostones while stevensitic claystones with calcite spherulites fascicular calcite crusts intraclastic rudstones and grainstones and dolostones are the main lithologic types in the sag section The eogenetic evolution of bioclastic reservoirs was controlled by the balance between dissolution and neomorphism of the aragonitic bivalve and gastropod bioclasts favoring either the generation of poorly connected moldic porosity or the preservation of well-connected interparticle porosity The stevensitic arenites were strongly affected by meteoric dissolution and replacement by dolomite and silica related to regional uplift and erosion after the rift phase which generated highly heterogeneous pore systems with moldic intercrystalline vugular and microcrystalline pores Stevensitic claystones that are replaced by calcite spherulites and dolomite normally show low porosity but locally constitute reservoirs where secondary porosity was generated by stevensite dissolution The precipitation of crystal shrubs of fascicular-optic calcite in coalescent crusts generated growth-framework primary porosity which was reduced mostly by dolomite cementation or enlarged by dissolution enhancing their permeability Non-coalescent calcite crusts contain abundant syngenetic magnesian clay minerals Their porosity is related to dissolution of these clays which generated poor permeability Intraclastic grainstones and rudstones are compacted and cemented or rich in clay matrix hybrid packstones Where they display preserved interparticle primary porosity or matrix dissolution they may have good porosity and permeability The heterogeneous dolomitization of both the rift and the sag deposits either destroyed their primary or early diagenetic porosity or generated high porosity and permeability values in the dolostones Relationships between replacement and compaction indicate that most of the diagenetic processes occurred during eodiagenesis controlled mostly by the instability of the aragonite in the bioclastic reservoirs and of the stevensite in the claystones ooidal arenites and fascicular calcite crusts This study characterizes the major primary and diagenetic aspects of the pre-salt reservoirs providing insights on the evolution of their porosity and permeability This is expected to contribute to the prediction of quality during exploration and to enhance hydrocarbon recovery from producing oil elds as well as to increase the understanding of the origin evolution and quality distribution in analogous lacustrine reservoirs INTRODUCTION In the last decade giant hydrocarbon accumulations were discovered in lacustrine carbonate reservoirs below Aptian evaporites along the South Atlantic conjugate margins Carminatti et al 2009 Sallet et al 2016 These reservoirs together with important discoveries in China have attracted significant interest in the exploration and scientific research of continental carbonates The genesis and evolution of pre-salt reservoirs represent a geologic enigma that has puzzled many major researchers by their huge extension and volume their unusual textural and compositional features and by what they will reveal about the South Atlantic tectonic structural stratigraphic and sedimentological generation and early evolution On the other hand knowledge of continental carbonates is relatively restricted when compared to that of marine carbonates which are much more voluminous and host giant reserves of hydrocarbons around the Published Online December 2017 Copyright 2017 SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology 1527-1404 17 087-1285 03 00 1286 R HERLINGER JR ET AL world In this sense the recent discoveries of huge hydrocarbon accumulations in lacustrine carbonates from Brazil Africa and China have attracted intense scientific interest for a better understanding of the formation and evolutionary processes of these reservoirs Modern and ancient lacustrine carbonates are characterized by a great variability of facies and mineral species having been studied for decades Lacustrine carbonates strongly contrast with marine carbonates While the main control on the environmental genetic conditions of marine carbonates is geological age Moore 2001 lacustrine carbonates have their genesis controlled by local geological settings such as tectonics climate fauna and specific geochemical conditions that can form very particular deposits Davis and Wilkinson 1983 De Wett et al 2002 Dunagan and Turner 2004 Gierlowski-Kordesch 2009 Fedorchuk 2014 The deposition of lacustrine carbonates is controlled by several factors including hydrological input and output of surface waters precipitation and groundwater flow sedimentary input and temperature variations Platt and Wright 1991 Tucker and Wright 1991 Water geochemistry plays a major role in lacustrine environments because it controls a number of processes including development of microbial communities Riding and Liang 2005 Vasconcelos et al 2006 Spadafora et al 2010 abiotic precipitation of carbonates Riding 2008 Wright and Barnett 2015 and clay minerals Calvo et al 1999 Pozo and Casas 1999 Furquim et al 2008 and the development of algae ostracodes and mollusks bivalves or gastropods Casanova 1986 Renaut et al 1986 Vincens et al 1986 Harris et al 1994 Frogley et al 2002 The pore systems of carbonate reservoirs both continental and marine show great diversity of pore types and wide heterogeneity Choquette and Pray 1970 Mazzullo and Harris 1991 Lucia 1995 Moore 2001 Mazzullo 2004 L n y 2006 Ahr 2008 Porosity is controlled by many factors including the interplay of physical chemical and biological depositional processes which are overprinted by intense diagenesis due to the chemical reactivity of carbonates as well as by fracturing and hydrothermal processes Ehrenberg et al 2006 Ehrenberg et al 2012 Chafetz 2013 Brigaud et al 2014 In most cases the porosity evolution patterns are controlled by a combination of mineral composition fabric and diagenetic conditions The carbonate permeability frequently correlates poorly with porosity due to heterogeneous porous framework where the original fabric can be intensely modified by diagenetic processes Du rrast and Siegesmund 1999 Weger et al 2009 van der Land et al 2013 Rezende and Pope 2015 The study of porosity geometry is important in characterization of carbonate reservoirs supporting petrophysical interpretation and improving predictability of reservoir quality and heterogeneity Basan et al 1997 Mountjoy and Marquez 1997 Eichenseer et al 1999 Machel 2005 The aim of this work is to discuss the impact of diagenesis on the evolution of porosity and permeability of pre-salt lacustrine carbonates from northern Campos Basin through the combination of petrographic and petrophysical analyses This work contributes to the prediction of quality during exploration and aims to enhance recovery from producing oilfields as well as to increase the understanding of the origin evolution and quality distribution in analogous lacustrine reservoirs worldwide GEOLOGICAL SETTING The Campos Basin is a passive-margin basin situated on the northern coast of the Rio de Janeiro State Brazil Fig 1A extending to the southern coast of the Esp rito Santo State being geographically located between parallels 218 and 238 S The basin is located between the Santos Basin to the south bounded by the Cabo Frio volcanic high and the Esp rito Santo Basin to the north bounded by the Vito ria High The Campos Basin was formed under an extensional tectonic regime during the breakup of the Gondwana Continent during Late Jurassic Early Cretaceous preceding the final separation of South America and Africa JSR and the formation of the South Atlantic Ocean Rabinowitz and LaBrecque 1979 Austin and Uchupi 1982 Nu rnberg and Mu ller 1991 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Guardado et al 2000 The formation of the Atlantic Ocean started with crustal thinning and breakup of Sa o Francisco Congo Rio de La Plata Kalahari cratons accreted during the Eoproterozoic orogeny South Atlantic formation began during the Jurassic with rifting between Argentina and southern Africa and through the Equatorial Margin Szatmari 2000 Meisling et al 2001 Mohriak et al 2008 The rupture of the central portion controlled by a resistant cratonic core Sa o Francisco Congo Craton occurred later in the Hauterivian Clemson et al 1997 Karner and Driscoll 1999 resulting in the development of a narrow rift zone in this region The Santos Esp rito Santo and Campos basins located on a Proterozoic fold belt developed wider basins Mohriak et al 2008 Rosendahl et al 2005 The Barremian to Aptian rift stage was characterized by increased lithospheric extension and asthenospheric uplift McKenzie 1978 White and McKenzie 1988 associated with extensive intracratonic tholeiitic volcanism Turner et al 1994 Mohriak et al 2008 Torsvik et al 2009 Elongated deep lakes formed parallel to basement lineaments and were filled with both volcanic and sedimentary rocks Dias et al 1988 Mizusaki et al 1988 The presence of transfer zones played an important role in the partitioning of the rifted margin in subbasins Meisling et al 2001 Muniz 2014 The Aptian sag stage is preceded by uplift and erosion of the rift section resulting in a regional unconformity Karner and Driscoll 1999 Dias 2005 Winter et al 2007 The initial sag sedimentation included carbonate Mg-clays and clastics which are overlain by evaporites formed in an arid climate under influx of incursions of marine seawater Abraha o and Warme 1990 Karner and Gambo a 2007 The last stage drift phase is characterized by the development of oceanic crust and a passive margin Chang et al 1988 Chang et al 1992 Aslanian et al 2009 The Lagoa Feia Group originally defined by Schaller 1973 as the Lagoa Feia Formation unconformably overlies pre-rift flood basalts from the Cabiu nas Formation comprising the nonmarine to transitional sequences from the Campos Basin Subsequently the Lagoa Feia Formation has been subdivided into four distinct depositional sequences bounded by unconformities including the Basal Clastic Sequence the Talc-Stevensitic Sequence the Coquinas Sequence and the Clastic Evaporitic Sequence Dias et al 1988 The last two sequences are separated by the pre-Alagoas unconformity More recently Winter et al 2007 subdivided the Lagoa Feia Formation into several formations elevating it to group status Fig 1B The rift phase Coqueiros Formation is composed mainly of bioclastic rudstones and grainstones informally known as coquinas interfingered with proximal clastic sediments of the Itabapoana Formation towards the western margin of the basin The Coqueiros Formation consists mainly of bioclasts of bivalve mollusks with subordinate amounts of gastropods and ostracods Some authors have proposed depositional and sedimentological models of bioclastic deposits Castro et al 1981 separated the bioclastic deposits into two types detrital coquinas consisting of bioclasts and noncarbonate grains talc-stevensite ooids and peloids and mud intraclasts and pure coquinas composed entirely of bioclasts Bertani and Carozzi 1985a recognized several microfacies separating sequences dominated by bivalves and by ostracods and according to variations on composition grain size matrix and cement content These authors related the distribution of microfacies to two distinct depositional models playalake settings dominated by ostracods and pluvial-lake settings dominated by bivalve mollusks Carvalho et al 2000 recognized seven main depositional environments based on facies associations including bioclastic beaches bioclastic sandy beaches and marginal lacustrine settings bioclastic sheet and bar fringes consisting of shell debris deposited by storm events bioaccumulation banks and deep lacustrine settings Recently Goldberg et al 2017 interpreted based on the integration of quantitative petrography sedimentology and

gamma ray logs and facies succession stratigraphy that the bioclastic rudstones correspond mostly to gravitational deposits resedimented from structural highs to deeper lacustrine settings throughout the rift section of the basin Sag phase deposits from the Macabu Formation were referred to by Dias et al 1988 as carbonate facies consisting of nodular diagenetic limestones and laminated limestones probably algal in origin stromatolites Later Dias 2005 interpreted laminites and microbial stromatolites as supratidal and upper-intertidal facies overlain by lower-intertidal clay-rich facies and subtidal mudstones deposited in an epicontinental context with extensive pre-evaporitic clastics located in shallow proximal regions Muniz and Bosence 2015 interpreted the absence of both marine biota and normal freshwater biota such as charophytes and the presence of nonmarine ostracods as evidence of a brackish-water lacustrine environment refuting the presence of tidal influence on microbial development However recent interpretation suggests that most deposits from the Macabu Formation are chemical precipitates controlled by the geochemistry of alkaline lacustrine waters Wright 2011 2012 2013 Tosca and Wright 2014 Wright and Barnett 2015 identified a typical cyclothem as composed of three main components mud-grade laminated carbonates accumulated in flooding phase calcite spherulites in a matrix of Mgsilicates and calcitic shrub-like growths trigged by evaporation controlled by pH and ionic activity METHODS This study is based on 780 samples from cores and sidewall plugs collected

microscopy SEM X-ray diffraction XRD and petrophysical JSR LACUSTRINE PRE-SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS FROM NORTHERN CAMPOS BASIN analysis In order to characterize the primary and diagenetic constituents the pore types and their relationships optical petrography was performed on thin sections impregnated with blue epoxy resin 139 thin sections were quantified and described in detail and 641 thin sections were classified according main constituents textures and pore types Pore types were classified according to Choquette and Pray 1970 Thin sections were stained for carbonate identification with an acid solution of alizarin red and potassium ferrocyanide Dickson 1965 A Zeiss Colibri fluorescence light-emitting-diode LED UV microscope was used to evaluate presence of organic matter and relations of replacement between fluorescent minerals In order to identify diagenetic carbonate phases cathodoluminescence CL microscopy was performed in a Cambridge Image Technology Ltd CITL luminoscope CL analyses were performed in CL8200 MK5-2 equipment coupled to Leica microscope under operating conditions of 300 mA and 17 kV Scanning electron microscopy SEM analyses using backscattered and secondary electrons were executed in ZEISS EVO LS15 or JEOL JSM 6490LV electron microscopes both equipped with OXFORD Inca Aztec energy-dispersed spectrometers EDS in order to investigate paragenetic relationships between primary and diagenetic constituents and to identify the elemental mineral composition in representative rock fragments and thin sections X-ray diffraction XRD analyses of the clay fraction including air-dried glycolsaturated and heated treatments were used to confirm the clay-mineral species Petrophysical analyses were performed on plugs cut from cores and on sidewall cores in order to determine porosity and permeability according to norm API RP 40 1998 Mercury injection capillary pressure MICP analyses were performed on a Micrometrics AutoPore IV 9500 equipment to determine the pore-throat size distribution of representative samples RESULTS Petrography The studied reservoirs in the rift section are composed of massive bioclastic rudstones and grainstones coquinas about 80 meters thick and by stevensitic arenites that occur at the top of the section described only in Well 4 Fig 2 Overlying these reservoirs there are crusts of calcite shrubs and stevensitic claystones that occur in millimetric to decimetric intercalations Additionally intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked spherulites and fragments of the crusts are found intercalated with the calcite crusts and stevensitic claystones Hybrid siltstones siliciclastic siltstones and claystones and microbial laminites are concentrated at the top of the sag section and at the bottom of Well 2 and are not considered reservoirs Bivalve Gastropod Rudstones and Grainstones Coquinas The bioclastic grainstones 9 of the samples and rudstones 91 of the samples are mostly massive poorly to well sorted with a chaotic or subparallel fabric The primary constituents are bioclasts of bivalves gastropods and ostracods Bivalves are the main component composing 100 of primary constituents in 64 of the samples Fig 3A Bivalves always occur disarticulated and their degree of reworking is widely variable Bivalve bioclasts are frequently broken or dissolved and have dimensions ranging from 0 07 to 25 mm average 2 3 mm in the thin sections Gastropods are observed in 36 of the samples and are typically whole and not abraded Fig 3B with preserved intraparticle porosity The ostracod bioclasts are whole sometimes articulated and occasionally recrystallized Ostracods occur in 8 of the samples and are the main primary component of grainstones Fig 3C in two samples Intraclasts of carbonate mud volcanic and siliciclastic grains occur in small amounts in the bioclastic rudstones and grainstones 1289 Calcite is the main cement of bioclastic rudstones and grainstones The bioclasts are covered by continuous rims of microcrystalline to prismatic calcite Fig 3D Drusy calcite frequently is the main interparticle cement Dissolution of bioclasts generates intraparticle and moldic pores which are filled by drusy Fig 3E and blocky calcite Subordinate cements that have filled interparticle pores include blocky coarse mosaic and microcrystalline calcite Recrystallization of the bivalve and gastropod bioclasts to blocky calcite is common masking the original fabric of the bioclastic rudstones and grainstones Bivalves are dull CL whilst intraparticle and interparticle cements are red in CL Fig 3F Bivalves and gastropods were either dissolved or neomorphosed calcitized commonly showing a heterogeneous range from total dissolution with variable intensity of calcite cementation of the intraparticle and moldic porosity to total neomorphism The distinction between neomorphism and moldic pores cementation is in many cases difficult without CL Calcitization of aragonitic bivalve and gastropod bioclasts often forms a mosaic of calcite crystals marked by fine lines of inclusions delineating the original structure of the shell Fig 3D In contrast the intraparticle and moldic pores were filled by drusiform Fig 3E and blocky calcite Dolomite occurs in 15 of the samples as a minor constituent 5 in the bioclastic rudstones and grainstones of Wells 3 and 5 and more rarely in Well 2 Blocky and saddle dolomite fill locally interparticle intraparticle moldic and vugular pores Dolostones up to 10 meters thick occur in Well 5 as a product of replacement of the bioclastic rocks These rocks are composed of small rhombohedral and rarely of saddle dolomite crystals Sucrosic dolostones preserve partially the shape of the bioclasts Fig 4A Silica occurs in 44 of the samples rarely making up more than 2 of the rock volume Chalcedony and quartz as blocky prismatic coarse mosaic and microcrystalline often occur in small amounts mainly replacing calcite and rarely filling interparticle intraparticle moldic and vugular porosity in bioclastic rudstones and grainstones Microcrystalline quartz rims locally cover bioclasts Drusy quartz locally fills moldic and vugular porosity Displacive pore-filling interparticle quartz cement was observed in 4 of the samples Fig 4B Bioclastic grainstones and rudstones have a poor diversity of diagenetic minerals Barite BaSO4 and celestine SrSO4 are rare filling interparticle porosity or replacing calcite cements and bivalves The aluminum-phosphate-sulfate APS minerals svanbergite SrAl3 PO4 SO4 OH 6 and goyazite SrHAl3 PO4 2 OH 6 locally replace mud intraclasts Fig 4C in bioclastic rudstones The main pore types in bioclastic rudstones are interparticle intraparticle moldic and vugular Figs 3A D E 4D E Bioclastic grainstones have predominantly intercrystalline and moldic porosity Figs 3C 4F Dolomitized rudstones and grainstones are both rich in intercrystalline porosity Fig 4A Well 2 shows a cyclical variation of predominant pore types along the studied interval from moldic to interparticle and to moldic again The samples of Well 3 display predominance of moldic porosity and those of Well 5 of interparticle porosity Well 1 was not sampled in the bioclastic succession and Well 4 was poorly sampled Stevensitic Arenites Massive well to moderately sorted arenites composed of stevensitic ooids and stevensite-coated carbonate particles occur at the top of the rift section only in Well 4 forming an interval about 50 meters thick Fig 2 The occurrence of these ooids is very common in the rift section of the Campos Basin Previous studies pointed to a composition of stevensite kerolite and talc for such ooids Bertani and Carozzi 1985a 1985b Rehim et al 1986 Abraha o and Warme 1990 Armelenti et al 2016 These clay ooids are commonly dissolved and replaced by dolomite and quartz and often are deformed The diagenetic patterns of the stevensitic arenites are very heterogeneous Frequently the ooids are cemented by dolomite or quartz and almost completely silicified 1290 R HERLINGER JR ET AL JSR FIG 3 Photomicrographs of primary bioclastic composition of

common in Well 1 locally together with other phosphatic grains Ostracods are frequently concentrated in the laminations Fig 6F and occur articulated with limited reworking Their partial to total replacement by quartz or dolomite is common in 34 of samples Calcite spherulites are the most common diagenetic constituent in the stevensite deposits occurring as an important component in all studied wells Figs 6A 7A B Spherulites 0 15 to 2 5 mm in diameter average 0 8 mm frequently replaced the stevensitic claystones and hybrid siltstones displacing and deforming the unconsolidated sediments Figs 6A 7B Few spherulites have recognizable nuclei made of clay peloids ostracods intraclasts and lumps of microcrystalline calcite Spherulites are abundant coalescing as irregular levels

showing fascicular-optic and or radialfibrous texture similar to crusts but with concentric growth Fig 7D Some pisoliths are formed by thin concentric laminae 0 5 mm while others are formed by divergent coalescence of fascicular-optic calcite aggregates reaching up to 2 mm in diameter The pisoliths are deformed and recrystallized Pisolithic aggregates are not fluorescent and seem to replace stevensite like spherulites inside unconsolidated sediments Dolomite replaces stevensite in nearly all the samples Figs 6B E F 7A B Stevensite laminae are replaced and deformed by blocky dolomite Figs

authigenic illite smectite clays are identified in XRD Intercalations of millimetric to centimetric levels of cherts and dolostones along stylolitic contacts are formed by replacement of laminated clay deposits Dolomite fluoresces blue green yellow or brown under UVF Fig 6E while silica is brown to green under UVF when replacing stevensite Cubic blocky and microcrystalline pyrite although

aggregates sensu Kendall 1977 i e plumose or increasingly divergent constitute the main reservoirs of the sag section These calcite aggregates grew predominantly in a vertical to near vertical orientation Fig 8A B with an average individual length of 1 55 mm up to 12 mm encrusting various deposits The fascicular aggregates commonly display a shrub shape that coalesces both vertically and horizontally forming calcite crusts of variable thickness up to 80 cm thick In some cases fibrous calcite aggregates form millimetric continuous and isopachous palisade crusts Fig 8C intercalated with microcrystalline calcite or dolomite siliciclastic mud or stevensite laminae Recrystallization is frequent generating apparently massive forms although with remnants of the original fibrous crystal fabric recognizable in polarized light and in SEM images Fig 8D The engulfment and replacement of siliciclastic grains stevensite peloids and ostracod bioclasts by fascicular-optic calcite aggregates

and Grainstones Most of the diagenesis of the bioclastic rocks occurred before compaction Fig 12 as evidenced by the distribution of the blocky and drusiform interparticle pore-filling cements The bioclastic rocks followed three main evolution pathways controlled by distinct eogenetic conditions Fig 13 Pathway 1 was probably connected to active circulation of interstitial fluids undersaturated with respect to aragonite most likely lacustrine freshwaters during more humid periods which promoted intense dissolution of the aragonitic bivalves cf Morse and Mackenzie 1990 Moore and Wade 2013 and the precipitation of calcite prismatic rims in interparticle and intraparticle pores Fig 3E Pathway 2 was promoted probably where less dilute fluids initially allowed preservation of the bioclasts cf James and Choquette 1984 Caron and Nelson 2009 and precipitation of calcite prismatic rims and drusiform cement followed by extensive dissolution of bioclasts and generation of moldic porosity Fig 4F Pathway 3 developed where limited circulation of fluids slightly supersaturated with respect to aragonite favored the precipitation of thin calcite rims the neomorphism of the bioclasts Fig 3D and the preservation of interparticle porosity The common alternation of intervals with predominance of neomorphism and of dissolution indicates frequent oscillation between these interpreted environmental conditions Such diagenetic variations may be related to climatic control of the composition and level of lacustrine waters or to tectonically driven hydraulic gradients probably related to faulting along the rift margins generating patterns that cannot be correlated among the studied wells This paragenetic evolution of the bioclastic rudstones and grainstones Fig 12 differs from that of equivalent rocks from the central and southern parts of the basin where there is a predominance of aragonite neomorphism in relation to dissolution Bertani and Carozzi 1985b Altenhofen 2013 Muniz 2014 Goldberg et al 2017 Typical vadose features such as pendant or meniscus cements cf James and Choquette 1984 infiltration of clay and or silt and development of soils and calcretes were not observed in the bioclastic rocks indicating that exposure was not significant in the succession The locally observed displacive silica cementation of bioclastic rocks was therefore not related to the formation of silcretes under subaerial arid conditions Ross and Chiarenzelli 1985 Khalaf 1988 Hesse 1989 Murray 1990 Since the bioclastic deposits are poor in siliciclastic grains such early silica precipitation was probably derived from dissolution of the stevensitic ooids Origin and Diagenesis of Stevensite Recent studies indicate that Mg-clays are formed from Si-Mg hydrated gel precursors Tosca and Wright 2014 Wright and Barnett 2015 which evolve to stevensite kerolite talc and other Mg-clay mineral phases in highly alkaline lacustrine and palustrine environments Rehim et al 1986 Pozo and Casas 1999 Experimental studies show that this evolution depends on a number of environmental factors including pH salinity temperature and ionic content Jones 1986 Tosca and Masterson 2014 The alkaline conditions needed for stevensite precipitation ph 10 were recurrent during the rift evolution as stevensite arenites occur in different stages and areas of the Campos rift Bertani and Carozzi 1985a 1985b Armelenti et al 2016 Goldberg et al 2017 These conditions were very different from the fresh-water environments colonized by bivalves and gastropods The common mixture of stevensite ooids and peloids with bivalve bioclasts in the Campos Basin rift section indicates their extensive gravitational resedimentation in deeper lacustrine environments throughout the evolution of the rift Goldberg et al 2017 Pozo and Casas 1999 suggested that gel coagulation would result in granular clay particles which could explain the common peloidal habit of 1301 stevensite The habit of stevensite could be related to the energy of its depositional environment as observed for glauconite berthierine and other syngenetic clay minerals e g Van Houten and Purucker 1984 Odin 1988 As for these clays the stevensitic ooids were probably formed in environments with some agitation by waves or currents while the laminated stevensitic claystones were certainly deposited in low-energy environments The peloids were probably formed in environments of an energy level between that for the formation of the ooids and that for the laminated claystones According to Tosca and Wright 2015 the high sensitivity to pCO2 pH and the fast dissolution kinetics due to the high specific surface area favors the eogenetic dissolution of Mg-clays The common dissolution and replacement of stevensite by silica and dolomite probably occurred mostly during eodiagenesis Fig 12 controlled by variations in the chemistry of the lacustrine waters As observed in other rift lakes e g Renaut et al 1986 De Wet et al 2002 dilution of lake waters during more humid periods or input of CO2 by magmatic and hydrothermal activity may have promoted the dissolution of Mg-clays liberating silica and magnesium and favoring the precipitation of silica and dolomite Further dissolution of stevensite ooids and peloids after cementation generated abundant moldic and intraparticle porosity Fig 5 Intense dissolution silicification and dolomitization are observed in stevensitic arenites just below the pre-Alagoas regional unconformity suggesting alteration in a subaerial environment during post-rift uplift and exposure Genesis of Calcite Spherulites The most abundant eogenetic constituent replacing stevensite are spherulites of calcite which occur throughout the sag succession Figs 6A 7A B The formation of spherulites has been interpreted to be favored in the interior of inorganic gels although the viscous medium is not a prerequisite for spherulite growth Beck and Andreassen 2010 Shtukenberg et al 2012 Our petrographic evidence shows that the development of spherulites occurred inside the stevensite laminations or the hybrid siltstones displacing and replacing the original unconsolidated sediment suggesting early diagenetic conditions Laboratory studies have reported that the development of calcite spherulites is favored in alkaline conditions with high concentrations of silica and magnesium Garc a-Ruiz 2000 Meister et al 2011 which agrees with the interpreted alkaline lacustrine environment Most of the spherulites show no visible nuclei and some display stevensite peloids siliciclastic grains and ostracod bioclasts as nuclei Natural and synthetic spherulites interpreted as formed by direct microbial activity Braissant et al 2003 Spadafora et al 2010 have submicrometric dimensions differing significantly from those found in the pre-salt rocks Formation and Evolution of Fascicular Calcite Crusts Fascicular calcite crusts are interpreted as syngenetic or synsedimentary precipitates encrusting many different deposits The absence of clotted and cryptocrystalline textures as well as of irregular branching structures characteristic of the mineralization of benthic microbial communities cf Burne and Moore 1987 Riding 2000 and the continuous fibrous crystal fabric of the fascicular crusts indicate that they are not microbialites sensu Burne and Moore 1987 but rather a product of abiotic precipitation A chemical abiotic precipitation has been interpreted for texturally equivalent deposits in travertines cf Chafetz and Guidry 1999 Fouke 2011 stromatolites cf Grotzinger and Knoll 1995 1999 Riding 2008 Pope et al 2000 alkaline-saline lakes cf Jones and Renaut 1994 Warren 2006 and more recently for the pre-salt reservoirs themselves Wright and Barnett 2015 Additionally the absence of luminescence of the fascicular calcite suggests a low content of organic matter inclusions in the aggregates The fascicular calcite aggregates precipitated not only 1302 R

particularly the background stevensitic deposits but also partially replacing them This is indicated by the common occurrence of clay laminations peloids and other particles in the interstitial spaces and as inclusions in the aggregates The truncation of clay laminations by fascicular calcite aggregates is common indicating that they grew as early diagenetic replacement The combined evidence indicates that the precipitation of syngenetic calcite crusts and of stevensite was chemically controlled by the dynamic evolution of the lacustrine environmental conditions Stevensite precipitated under high concentrations of silica and magnesium and low pCO2 while calcite precipitation was favored by less concentrated fluids related to less arid periods and or by degassing after pCO2 input from magmatic and or hydrothermal activity The paragenetic relationships of calcite crusts with stevensite and the main evolution pathways are illustrated in Figure 14 Where calcite precipitation predominated the development of coalesced fascicular shrubs formed interstitial growth-framework porosity with variable amounts of trapped clastic and stevensitic particles The dissolution of stevensite released magnesium and silica which resulted in replacement of calcite shrubs by silica and dolomite cement partially or totally filling the growthframework porosity In other cases the growth-framework pores were enlarged by dissolution of the fascicular aggregates Where calcite precipitation was less extensive discontinuous non-coalesced calcite crusts were formed intercalated laterally and vertically by stevensite Stevensite deposits were heterogeneously replaced by calcite spherulites and by dolomite The dissolution of stevensite among spherulites locally generated porosity but seldom reservoirs as dolomite commonly cemented the secondary porosity generated by stevensite dissolution Diagenesis of the Intraclastic Grainstones and Rudstones Two main patterns of eogenetic evolution defined by the relationship between compaction and cementation were recognized in the intraclastic grainstones and rudstones formed by fragmentation of the calcite crusts and reworking of spherulites and stevensitic particles Fig 15 1 Rocks with limited eogenetic cementation were affected by mechanical and chemical compaction followed by mesogenetic calcite cementation Fig 10C 2 Partial heterogeneous eogenetic cementation by calcite or dolomite promoted the preservation of interparticle primary porosity inhibiting pressure dissolution The porosity was heterogeneously enlarged by dissolution of the intraclasts Fig 10D Some samples display abundant eogenetic precipitation of displacive silica which filled the porosity and inhibited the mesogenetic processes Clay-rich packstones formed by intraclasts and clay matrix Fig 10B locally show early dissolution of the matrix enabling a diagenetic evolution similar to that observed in the grainstones and rudstones Fig 15 Figure 12 shows the paragenesis of the intraclastic grainstones and rudstones Dolomite Dolomite occurs very frequently in the studied pre-salt rocks especially in the sag section with various morphologies and timings At least five major phases of dolomite precipitation were identified Early dolomite grew inside unconsolidated stevensite laminae visibly displacing the sediment Fig 6E A microbial origin for these early dolomites is unlikely since the mechanism of dolomite precipitation by sulfate-reducing bacteria proposed by McKenzie and Vasconcelos 2009 would not be effective in lacustrine environments with low sulfate as evidenced by the absence of pyrite framboids or of primary and or eogenetic sulfates The formation of early dolomite was probably directly related to the dissolution of stevensite although it may have been favored also by the dehydration of magnesium complexes promoted by the carboxylated surfaces of the organic matter present in the stevensite Roberts et al 2013 A second type of dolomite occurrence corresponds to a mimetic replacement of stevensite laminations Fig 7B which is normally not associated with porosity generation A third type of dolomite occurs as pore filling on sag deposits cementing calcite crusts and intraclastic rocks Pre-compaction dolomite cementation on intraclastic grainstones and rudstones suggests an early eogenetic origin for dolomite pore filling A fourth pattern of dolomitization corresponds to the pervasive replacement of the rock Fig 4A common in both the rift bioclastic rocks and in the deposits of the sag stage This dolomitization pattern frequently occurs associated with silicification and fracturing and with the generation of porosity which may be related to circulation of hydrothermal fluids The fifth type corresponds to the saddle dolomite Fig 11C which occurs frequently associated with fracturing Saddle dolomite is a common mesogenetic constituent in carbonate and clastic rocks Spo tl and Pitman 1998 and is not by itself indicative of hydrothermal alteration However its association with intense fracturing in some of the studied rocks suggests hydrothermal influence Hydrothermal and Mesogenetic Alterations The term hydrothermal has been defined in different ways generally to characterize changes related to hot-water circulation Machel 2002 suggests that the term should be used only to identify minerals that are formed at temperatures higher than those of the host rocks regardless of the origin and composition of the fluids In this sense the identification of hydrothermal alteration would require isotopic and fluid-inclusion analyses or the presence of exotic mineralogy formed at high temperatures The presence of saddle dolomite does not define hydrothermal alteration since it can be formed at common burial temperatures and conditions as previously discussed However there are occurrences in the studied succession that are characterized by intense fracturing dissolution silicification dolomitization as well as concentration of barite fluorite kaolinite or dickite pyrite and other sulfides These alterations could be promoted by the focused circulation of deep-sourced fluids which generated distinct hydrothermal alterations Recently Alvarenga et al 2016 recognized multiple hydrothermal vents in the rift section of central Campos Basin Although lacking sampling of the most affected intervals areas with intense dissolution were interpreted in the well logs and formation tests as probably related to hypogenic hydrothermal karst cf Dublyansky 1995 Heward et al 2000 Such areas may be extremely important for fluid flow and hydrocarbon production Mesogenetic dissolution has not created a significant volume of porosity in the studied reservoirs Vuggy porosity occurs erratically along the studied reservoirs in several facies These vugs are interpreted to have been formed during mesodiagenesis by dissolution of primary and eogenetic constituents since typical eogenetic cements are not observed filling these pore types Such dissolution may have been generated by acidic pore waters derived from the rift shales Racey et al 2001 Beavington-Penney et al 2008 Although exotic minerals such as epidotes prehnite amphiboles and metallic sulfides were not observed in channel and vugular porosity the influence of hydrothermal fluids on mesogenetic dissolution at pore scale cannot be ruled out Celestine barite and anhydrite occasionally occur as late cements filling primary and secondary porosity and or replacing primary and diagenetic constituents As these minerals are commonly related to fractured intervals their precipitation was probably connected with the circulation of deep fluids although they could be locally influenced by the dissolution of overlying evaporites The occurrence of aluminum phosphate-sulfate APS minerals is not indicative of any specific genetic environment occurring in a wide diversity of geological settings including sedimentary carbonates and siliciclastics igneous and metamorphic rocks Dill 2001 Traces of svanbergite goyazite occur replacing mud intraclasts in the bioclastic

by large pore throats MICP analyses indicate that the pore throats are significantly larger than in other petrofacies Fig 17A In some cases however continued cementation has narrowed the pore throats decreasing permeability Subordinate moldic pores increased the porosity but with little effect on permeability Nevertheless the local development of vugular pores has enlarged the primary pores enhancing permeability Bivalve Gastropod Rudstones with Moldic Porosity Bioclastic rocks with predominantly moldic or intraparticle porosity combined with some interparticle porosity are common These rocks have good porosity but low permeability Table 1 Fig 16A The cementation of the moldic and intraparticle pores is common occasionally totally occluding the secondary porosity The remaining interparticle pores contribute to the permeability but because pore throats are controlled by microcrystalline and intercrystalline pores Fig 17A permeabilities are generally low Locally vugular porosity was formed by enlargement and connection of molds increasing pore throats and generating fair permeability conditions Bivalve Gastropod Rudstones with Vugular Porosity Vugular porosity is

presence of remnants of interparticle porosity contributes to some permeability though generally low However because core samples with high vugular porosity were poorly recovered and not suitable for petrophysical analyses it is possible that the amount of vugular porosity was underestimated in the reservoirs due to these sampling limitations Bivalve Gastropod Grainstones with Moldic Porosity These grainstones have a high content of moldic porosity and a total porosity higher than all the bioclastic petrofacies Table 1 Fig 16A These rocks generally present remaining interparticle porosity which gives them some permeability Vugular porosity was generated from enlargement of moldic porosity producing widened pore throats which increases permeability The grainstones often present recrystallization which has generated intercrystalline porosity but with narrow pore throats Fig 17B and low permeability Stevensitic Arenites The high instability of Mg-clays cf Tosca and Wright 2014 has favored the dissolution of ooids and the precipitation of silica and dolomite Fig 5 redistributing the original porosity The pore system of stevensitic arenites is extremely heterogeneous generally presenting high porosities and highly variable permeabilities Table 1 Fig 16E The dissolution of ooids resulting in moldic and intraparticle porosity was important generating a significant increase in porosity Microporosity in authigenic silica is observed Remnants of primary 1307 interparticle porosity are occasionally preserved although the original interstitial porosity of most of the samples was completely filled by dolomite and quartz Dolomitization has generated abundant intercrystalline porosity occasionally connecting moldic and intracrystalline pores and supplying permeability to the stevensitic arenites Coalescent Calcite Crusts Coalescent calcite crusts are composed of well-developed shrubs of fascicular calcite aggregates which coalesced vertically and or horizontally Fig 8A The growth of these precipitates generated a growth-framework primary pore system with moderate porosity and good permeability controlled by large pore throats Table 1 Fig 16B Rezende and Pope 2015 properly related aspects of the depositional texture including shrub size sorting and packing to the porosity and permeability of analogous calcite crust reservoirs from the Santos Basin According to those authors the size of individual shrubs exerts a primary control on pore size affecting both porosity and permeability Although depositional texture probably exerted a major control on the primary petrophysical properties of the crusts their primary fabric was strongly modified during diagenesis by cementation and or dissolution The dissolution of stevensite laminae or peloids filling interstices among the fascicular aggregates or in adjacent layers favored the precipitation of dolomite partially or totally cementing the interstitial porosity which represented the main reducer of primary porosity Commonly coalescent crusts present porosity enhancement through partial dissolution of shrubs and cements Fig 8A which has increased their porosity and has led to an enlargement of pore throats with a consequent increase of permeability Fig 17D Intracrystalline porosity related to dissolution of dolomite crystals Fig 9B C or shrubs is very common Porosity is present even in rocks without petrographic porosity due to intracrystalline porosity generated from dissolution of shrubs as observed in SEM analyses Fig 9E Non-Coalescent Calcite Crusts Poorly developed calcite crusts with non-coalescent shrubs of fascicular calcite display interstices occupied by stevensite laminae and peloids or even by siliciclastic matrix resulting in limited growth-framework primary porosity Fig 14 Consequently these rocks show low primary porosity and permeability Commonly associated stevensite laminae and peloids were partially replaced mainly by calcite spherulites and dolomite crystals Later dissolution has generated intercrystalline porosity Fig 7E The dominance of discontinuous intercrystalline porosity plus minor growth-framework porosity has generated poor reservoirs with mostly narrow pore throats Figs 16B 17E Most non-coalescent crusts have low porosity and permeability Even though these reservoirs present poor quality Table 2 they can store oil and probably contribute to the production of the wells Intraclastic Grainstones and Rudstones Few intraclastic rocks exhibit good reservoir quality owing to partially preserved primary porosity representing good quality reservoirs Table 2 Fig 16D At least part of the intraclastic grainstones and rudstones composed of reworked calcite crusts and spherulites had good primary interparticle porosity which was destroyed by compaction and cementation Fig 10C Heterogeneous cementation preserved part of the primary porosity which was enhanced by particle dissolution while the porosity of uncemented rocks was completely obliterated during mesodiagenesis by interparticle pressure dissolution and calcite cementation Fig 15 No clear particle size control is observed on porosity and permeability suggesting that diagenesis is the major control Secondary intraparticle porosity in partly dissolved intraclasts is occasionally seen in rocks with some preserved interparticle porosity Fig 10D When moldic or vugular porosity occur associated with interparticle porosity permeability is higher generating the best reservoir conditions among the intraclastic rocks

diagenesis on pore type and permeability in studied reservoir petrofacies A pore type of bioclastic bivalve gastropod rudstones and grainstones ranges between totally moldic to interparticle The interpretive axis Interparticle Porosity represents 100 of interparticle pores which may be preserved or reduced by compaction and cementation The other extreme axis would represent 100 moldic porosity which increases by dissolution of bioclasts or decreases by cementation of molds In addition intercrystalline porosity often generated by dolomitization increases both total porosity and permeability Samples show the association of more than one type of pore ranging between the interpreted axes B Coalescent calcite crusts have primary growthframework porosity that can be reduced by cementation or preserved and increased by pore enlargement Alternatively the interstices may have been early filled by stevensite which may have been preserved or dissolved Porosity of non-coalescent crusts is related to the dissolution of stevensite generating intercrystalline porosity among dolomite crystals and spherulites Abundant intracrystalline dissolution is observed within calcite crusts and dolomite cements which generates some porosity with minor effect on permeability C Dolostones have a well-defined trend of porosity and permeability controlled by the amount of intercrystalline porosity D Intraclastic rudstones and grainstones are intensely affected by compaction and cementation Partial preservation of interparticle porosity promotes preservation of permeability both porosity and permeability may be increased by particle dissolution E Stevensitic arenites pore types range between moldic microcrystalline porosity related to silicification low permeability and moldic intercrystalline porosity related to dolomitization high permeability Clay-Rich Packstones Intraclastic rocks with clay matrix are usually not reservoirs In some cases however early dissolution of matrix occurred leaving residual dolomite and or silica Some of such petrofacies evolved similarly to grainstones with secondary porosity partially preserved by heterogeneous cementation Fig 15 Another possibility for the occurrence of secondary porosity in clay-rich packstones is through early heterogeneous dolomitization or silicification followed by dissolution Dolostones Dolomitization is a very important process generating rocks with the best porosity and permeability of the studied reservoirs Table 1 Fig 16C In many cases sucrosic dolomitization has added intercrystalline porosity leaving relicts of primary interparticle or moldic and or vugular secondary porosity Dolomitized rudstones with moldic and or vugular porosity have developed higher porosities and permeabilities after dolomitization through the connection of vugs and molds by intercrystalline porosity which have controlled pore throat diameters Fig 17C However the vugular porosity can be directly related to dolomitization processes Late processes were limited to the precipitation of minor amounts of saddle dolomite preserving most of the intercrystalline porosity generated during dolomitization The frequent total dolomitization of sag rocks generated significant decrease of pore throat size Fig 17F Apparently early dolomitization caused severe porosity reduction while dolomitization associated with fracturing has generated higher porosities and permeabilities 1999 Claes et al 2017 Travertines however exhibit steep facies diversity and distribution restricted to the immediate proximity of their source springs These features are not observed in the pre-salt calcite crusts indicating that these carbonates were precipitated in subaqueous environments Continuous subsidence during the sag stage with a constant supply of magnesium calcium and silica allowed the accumulation of more than 200 meters of precipitated carbonates and clays which allowed the development of reservoirs with impressive thicknesses The geometry of the fascicular calcite crusts inhibited the compaction of the reservoirs preserving good permeability associated with large pores and wide pore throats The dissolution of stevensite after the precipitation of spherulites and dolomite developed significant secondary porosity in originally argillaceous deposits Tosca and Wright 2015 The distribution of calcite stevensite and porosity in the sag section follows complex patterns which were fundamentally controlled not by lacustrine base level but by the chemistry of the lake waters Wright and Barnett 2015 These observations have significant implications for the construction of predictive and conceptual models for the exploration of the sag pre-salt reservoirs in the Campos and Santos basins and for planning the development and optimizing oil recovery from the producing oilfields CONCLUSIONS 1 Implications for Exploration of Lacustrine Carbonates The absence of features characteristic of vadose diagenesis i e pendular or meniscus cements geopetal features etc and of exposure surfaces in massive bioclastic reservoirs about 100 meters thick suggests that they were accumulated in relatively deep lacustrine environments The extensive resedimentation of the bioclastic deposits by gravitational mass movements was probably triggered by tectonism as also observed in the central area of the basin Goldberg et al 2017 These factors allowed the accumulation of thick bioclastic deposits which were probably remobilized from shoreface and related shallow-water environments The limited fragmentation and abrasion of bivalve shells suggests little reworking and short residence time in moderate energy shallow environments before redeposition The good preservation of the bioclasts contributes to the common occurrence of reservoirs with good permeability owing to large pores connected by wide pore throats Redeposition to deep lacustrine settings allowed impressive accumulation of the bioclastic deposits and inhibited extensive dissolution of the bioclasts and interparticle cementation Thus bioclastic deposits redeposited in relatively deep lacustrine settings may constitute attractive exploratory targets in other areas of the Campos Basin and in other rift basins with similar geologic context The crusts of fascicular-optic calcite present significant similarity with crystalline shrub facies and pore types of travertines Chafetz and Guidry 2 3 4 A study integrating systematic petrographic characterization and petrophysical analysis reveals that the pre-salt lacustrine reservoirs of northern Campos Basin have complex pore systems which result in highly heterogeneous permeability patterns The primary composition and porosity have a strong influence on the evolution quality of the reservoirs The compositional and porosity evolution of the bioclastic rudstone and grainstone rift reservoirs is controlled by the balance between dissolution and neomorphism of the aragonitic bivalves and gastropods When the circulation and geochemistry of eogenetic interstitial fluids favored the dissolution of aragonite and precipitation of low magnesium calcite moldic porosity was generated and primary interparticle porosity was reduced resulting in low permeability The predominance of neomorphism over dissolution resulted in higher permeability due to the preservation of primary interparticle porosity The redeposition of the bioclasts into relatively deep lacustrine settings is a crucial factor for the accumulation of thick deposits with partially preserved interparticle porosity which constitute good quality reservoirs Sag stage stevensitic deposits were replaced mainly by calcite spherulites and dolomite These rocks locally constitute reservoirs where secondary porosity was generated by stevensite dissolution Dissolution of stevensite provided magnesium and silica favoring the dolomitization and silicification commonly observed in the studied succession 1310 R HERLINGER JR ET AL JSR FIG 17 Distribution of pore throats of studied samples and their interpreted relationship with the pore type each color represents one

fascicular-optic calcite crusts with growth-framework primary porosity or interstitial porosity generated by the dissolution of stevensite constitute the main sag phase reservoirs The patterns of preservation dissolution and replacement of stevensite exerted an important control on the quality of these reservoirs Petrographic evidence indicates that most of the mineralogical and porosity evolution of these rocks occurred during eodiagenesis mainly in response to the high reactivity of the stevensite 6 Syngenetic sag precipitates were controlled by the geochemistry of lacustrine waters through changes on pH Mg and Ca activities temperature and pCO2 promoting the alternation of periods of calcite or stevensite precipitation The syngenetic precipitation of fascicular calcite crusts took place mostly covering stevensitic deposits although in some cases they clearly replaced stevensite suggesting that at least part of the fascicular calcite is diagenetic JSR LACUSTRINE PRE-SALT

when the interparticle porosity is preserved and or the clays are dissolved Stevensitic arenites were strongly affected by meteoric dissolution and replacement by dolomite and silica related to regional uplift and erosion after the rift phase The resulting rocks composed almost exclusively by silica and or dolomite have a complex porous system with moldic microcrystalline and intergranular porosity and highly heterogeneous permeability patterns Dolomitization is an important process of porosity modification of both rift and sag deposits showing a great diversity of origins and fabrics Early dolomitization related mainly to stevensite dissolution and replacement has usually not enhanced reservoir quality However dolomitization related to late fracturing and silicification has

SPECIAL TOPIC MODELLING INTERPRETATION Reinterpreting the South Atlantic Pre-Salt Microbialite reservoirs petrographic isotopic and seismic evidence for a shallow evaporitic lake depositional model Paul Wright1 and Karyna Rodriguez 2 review the current controversy over the South Atlantic PreSalt Microbialite reservoirs and how the initial interpretations based on seismic data have been shown to be incorrect opening up new possibilities for exploration Introduction The first encounter of the Pre-Salt Aptian Microbialite carbonate reservoirs the Barra Velha Fm in 2005 in the Parati field Santos Basin was followed by additional discoveries such as the multi-billion barrel Lula Tupi field Now nearly 30 more discoveries have been made in the basin such as Libra and Sapinhoa with recoverable reserves estimated as 30 BBOE Figure 1 Santos Campos key discoveries and 2D seismic database used in this analysis according to ANP In addition discoveries have been made in the adjacent Campos Basin including the P o de A car field Viera de Luca et al 2017 where the same unit is known as the Macabu Fm and also in the Kwanza Basin West Africa Saller et al 2016 After deposition in a late rift setting the Barra Velha Fm and its equivalents were buried by more than 1 km of marine origin evaporites of the Ariri Fm and its equivalents as the Albian Ocean seeped and poured into the basin Depositional model understanding evolution From the initial discoveries the thick up to 550 m carbonate unit has been widely considered as representing lacustrine microbialite platforms Carminatti et al 2009 Kattah 2017 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 based on seismic geometries and naked eye similarities between well cores and outcrop samples Microbialites are organosedimentary deposits that have accreted as a result of a benthic microbial community trapping and binding detrital sediment and or forming the locus of mineral precipitation Burne and Moore 1987 Stromatolites are among the most common examples of this type of carbonate Seismic geometries indicating high relief structures with relief of hundreds of metres with progradational and mounded geometries have been assumed to represent large-scale build-ups Buckley et al 2015 comparable to both Precambrian and later marine platforms Marine microbialite platforms with growth relief of 600 m are known such as those hosting the supergiant oil and gas fields of the Pre-Caspian of Kazakhstan However extensive core recovery from the Santos Basin has shown that under the microscope microbial textures are in fact rare in the Barra Velha Fm Wright and Barnett 2015 and no examples of lacustrine build-ups of such scale are known from the geological record The alternative model for the depositional setting of the Barra Velha Fm is that of extensive hyper-alkaline shallow evaporitic lakes Wright and Barnett 2015 To add to the complexity of understanding the reservoir much of the porosity is interpreted as owing to the dissolution of former Mg-silicate clays Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2017a 1 PW Carbonate Geoscience 2 Spectrum Corresponding author E-mail vpw pwcarbonategeoscience com FIRST

carbonate factory producing the sediment Williams et al 2011 and climate Lake deposystems are controlled by often highly complex hydrological factors reflecting the interaction of local climate tectonics and the composition of the catchment geology Many lakes are highly sensitive to even small-scale climate changes whereas oceans are highly buffered from such effects Lakes are effectively tideless being strongly influenced by wave action yet owing to the limited size of most lakes limiting fetch wave base is relatively shallow resulting in thinner clean sands whether carbonate or siliciclastic in composition One especially relevant difference for the pre-salt is the fact that evaporitic lakes in particular are associated with highly diverse and complex varieties of authigenic clays in contrast to the relatively small range of clays found in marine sediments The presence of Mg-rich clays as evaporite products while lacking more typical marine evaporites such as halite and gypsum is a characteristic of lakes draining basic igneous terrains such as those surrounding the Barra Velha Fm lakes The formation and subsequent dissolution of the Mg clay stevensite in the Aptian lakes was a crucial factor in producing excellent reservoir quality as such clays undergo congruent dissolution to leave porosity Tosca and Wright 2015 With these and many other differences between lacustrine and marine carbonate systems extrapolating models and concepts from marine reservoirs to the non-marine Pre-Salt has been a contributory factor to the continued misinterpretation of critical seismic and lithological characteristics Figure 3 What is the Barra Velha Fm made of The Barra Velha reservoirs are remarkably uniform in terms of their composition comprising just two main grain types which SPECIAL TOPIC MODELLING INTERPRETATION cylcothems which unusually for the Barra Velha Fm do contain some microbial textures These cyclothems are of very shallow water origin yet are now separated in some wells by hundreds of metres of vertical relief and as much as 1 km in some cases prior to salt deposition Wright and Barnett 2107b Thus there is a problem Was the Santos Basin littered with lacustrine platforms with hundreds of metres of relief or more Was the formation deposited in very shallow lakes and and did it then undergo significant uplift prior during and or after to salt deposition Figure 5 Calcite spherulites here showing porosity after the dissolution of Mg silicate clays are either in-situ or reworked Wright and Barnett 2015 2017a The best reservoir facies consist of in-situ cm-sized crystal shrubs Figure 4 made of radiating fibrous calcites and resembling abiotic travertines The other key components are mm-sized spherulites made of radially arranged fibrous calcite but not laminated as in ooids These spherulites appear to have at least in part grown within silicate gels later transformed into stevensite clay and subsequently dissolved producing excellent porosity Figure 5 The shrubs and spherulites can be reworked into a range of different textures indicating frequent erosion of which the finest products are thin 0 3 m laminated carbonate muds containing fish and invertebrate remains indicating periods of fresher waters The coarsest reworked facies consist of well-sorted grainstones which can have excellent reservoir quality The association of grain types and their diagenesis and porosity formation are unique to the Barra Velha-type facies Wright and Barnett 2017a and its equivalent in the Campos Basin Herlinger et al 2017 and Kwanza Basins Saller et al 2016 Despite the seemingly indiscriminate use of the name Microbialite demonstrable microbial macro- and microstructures are very rare in the formation as a whole comprising 1 of its thickness Wright and Barnett 2015 Although these unusual lithologies are commonly interbedded on a decimetre-to-metre scale they do occur in cyclothems up to nearly 6 m thick consisting of a basal unit of laminated mudstones overlain by in situ spherulites and then by in-situ shrub units Wright and Barnett 2015 interpreted these as likely evaporite cycles a view supported by thermodynamic geochemical modelling Wright and Tosca 2016 Although uncertainties exist over the exact chemical conditions producing these exotic carbonates and clays what can be inferred is that the Aptian lakes were hyper alkaline and prone to evaporation Wright and Barnett 2017b identified possible trends in carbon and oxygen isotopic data from the Barra Velha Fm comparable to those from Quaternary lakes in the East African rift to further support the Barra Velha lakes as having been shallow and evaporitic In the uppermost few 10 metres of the formation across Santos Basin there are a series of distinctive gamma log spikes called the Lula s Fingers that represent shallowing-upwards Seismic database and quality issues High-quality seismic data is essential for both detailed and more regional evaluations of the proven pre-salt plays Seismic data available for this analysis consists of more than 13 000 km Phase 1 acquired in 2012 with 10 2 km of offsets a 10 m source and a 15 m-deep cable tow and 17 000 km Phase 2 acquired in late 2016 with 12 km of offsets 8 m source and a 15m-deep cable tow Figure 1 For salt interpretation low-frequency RTM imaging was used In salt basins 2D data has inherent limitations where a significant amount of energy can be considered to be out-of-plane With its ability to image overturned beds the RTM gives a better and cleaner image than the Kirchhoff but there will still be salt bodies where imaging uncertainty is great However with 2D data it is relatively fast to run salt scenario testing and derive a salt model that will optimally image both the base and pre-salt in both acquisition directions nominal strike and dip With low-frequency optimized RTM and multi-directional Figure 6 2012 RTM PSDM data compared to public

importance of data quality in evaluating the pre-salt section Potential pre-salt structures analogous to discoveries are clearly indicated in the 2012 RTM PSDM dataset whereas there is negligible imaging at pre-salt level in the public data Seismic characteristics of lacustrine carbonates If lacustrine carbonate platforms had developed and grown as have marine equivalents instead of forming a cover on existing structural highs as was the case in the Cretaceous Toca platforms of West Africa a specific localized carbonate source factory would be needed and one with limited diffusivity Williams et al 2011 In marine systems this is achieved by high levels of production by light-dependent groups associated with sediments Figure 7 Sub-lacustrine carbonate mound now exhumed by lake level fall in Pyramid Lake Nevada This structure some 105 m high was produced by carbonate precipitated around vents where calcium-rich waters mixed with alkaline lake waters Such structures are likely to have highly complex internal geometries and might not produce any internal seismic geometries of low transportability and extensive early cementation or by microbial factories However such organisms are not present in the Pre-Salt carbonate successions and neither shows evidence of any microbial factory An alternative view held in some companies is that the platforms represent subaerial travertine or tufa deposits where carbonate-charged fluids either as a point or linear source promote rapid precipitation of carbonates with a rapid decrease in carbonate production away from the source Studies of a wide range of travertine build-ups show their limited size because their feeder vents are intermittent and shift positions The relief on these build-ups is typically decametre-scale and rarely up to 40-50 m but progradation lengths are relatively short a few to several hundred metres at most The range of stacking geometries commonly seen in marine carbonate build-ups and a useful discriminator for identifying carbonate build-ups Burgess et al 2013 are apparently absent in travertines although down-stepping relationships are seen Thick 200 m and extensive travertine accumulations are known e g Turkey but these are likely to be composed of multiple decametre wedge-shaped units consisting of individual travertine cone mound or ridges systems of limited volumes and extent Seismic-scale differentiated platforms with topsets margins and slopes are unlikely to form in travertine systems Evidence for feeder systems such as faults would support a possible travertine origin but many vent fractures are sub-seismic-scale While possible hydrothermal vent complexes have been identified from the rift stage successions in the Campos Basin Alvarenga et al 2016 none have been described in detail from the Barra Velha Fm or its equivalents However isolated carbonate mounds could be produced both by subaerial and sub-lacustrine vent-related systems Mound-like features with relief of 400 m have been reported from the Barra Velha Fm Buckley et al 2015 Sub-lacustrine build-ups related again to vent activity are known to reach heights of 100 m in extant lakes Figure 7 but any such large build-ups would require growth in lakes of similar water depths Geochemical models for the Bara Velha Fm carbonates suggest formation in shallow lakes rather than deep ones A more likely explanation for these cone-like features on seismic data is that they are volcanic cones or even inversion features Figure 8 Seismic features responses and effects associated with marine carbonate platforms 74 FIRST BREAK I VOLUME 36 I MAY 2018 SPECIAL TOPIC MODELLING INTERPRETATION Figure 9 None of the discoveries analysed on the 2D dataset meet the Burgess et al seismic criteria for

Basin like those of marine systems Regardless of the likelihood that lacustrine build-ups would be different to marine forms discriminating carbonate build-ups from other features such as fault blocks or buried hills has been facilitated by a workflow from Burgess et al 2013 These authors identify a range of criteria that can be used for assessing the likelihood of a feature being a carbonate build-up and also rank those criteria most useful When trying to identify whether a bump could be a carbonate build-up marine or otherwise these categories of criteria can be assessed Figure 8

the illustrations provided by Liechoski et al 2017 Similarly none of the discoveries analysed using the 2D datasets available meet the criteria for a carbonate platform Figure 9 Barra Velha depositional environment evidence from seismic data Layered seismic geometries Figure 9 suggest a low relief depositional setting However the main challenge is explaining the significant seismic relief In order to investigate the discrepancy Figure 10 Dip and strike line through a major discovery in Santos Basin with interpretation of the Barra Velha Formation between base salt pink horizon and base of carbonate sequence blue horizon Note the truncational geometry of blue horizon implying an erosional episode at the start of the deposition of the carbonate sequence between observations at micro and macro scales a seismic facies analysis was carried out using the regional 2D seismic dataset covering the Santos Basin The seismic sequence associated with the Barra Velha Fm was found to have a distinctive low frequency relatively uniform varying from high amplitude to semi acoustically opaque character It was seen thinning on to structurally high areas and potentially missing at various structural culminations It lies directly beneath the base of a thick evaporite sequence and at its base is usually marked by an unconformity which seems to truncate the sequence below Figure 10 All these are important observations in trying to understand the depositional model of the Barra Velha and trying to relate it to the evaporitic shallow lake model However the major revelation came from flattening at the base of the evaporite sequence Figure 11 The Barra Velha s distinctive character is then seen to be extensive and relatively uniform across both present-day highs and lows This together with other observations made using this flattened display is surprisingly in agreement with and largely supports the shallow water lake model There is also evidence of internal onlap suggesting local tectonism which could also explain the extensive reworking of the carbonates and possible fan-delta facies and porous grainstones FIRST BREAK I VOLUME 36 I MAY 2018 75 SPECIAL TOPIC MODELLING INTERPRETATION Figure 11 Barra Velha sequence is observed to be extensive and relatively uniform below base salt consistent with extensive log correlation of Barra Velha facies across Santos Basin This supports the extensive shallow water lake model Some thickening implying syn-depositional subsidence with factory keeping up and some indication of post-depositional faulting Figure 12 Barra Velha seismic character extending into the present-day low areas Unexplored structural closures have been mapped off the structural high blocks Small scale faulting could indicate syn-Barra Velha deformation which could also indicate presence of the fan delta facies tionally as the same facies are found in the West African basins the Barra Velha may extend well beyond into the unexplored areas to the east So while reservoir facies presence is likely reservoir quality is dependent in part on either identifying likely fan delta facies or where the clays have dissolved Figure 13 Barra Velha seismic character extending into the present-day low areas Unexplored structural closures have been mapped off the structural high blocks Small scale faulting could indicate syn-Barra Velha deformation which could also indicate presence of the fan delta facies There are models which can explain post-Barra Velha deformation Deposition of salt causes rapid loading of the basin so that further basin subsidence can occur and mobile salt can be drained from structurally higher zones into the subsiding basins Seismic evidence indicates that downslope salt drainage occurred before any sediment overburden accumulated Davison et al 2012 This is a feedback process that can result in significant subsidence where salt bodies are thicker Figure 12 Conclusion With increased competition from oil companies in these basins access to one of the most prolific play types in the world will come from a good understanding and integration of the micro and macro scale characteristics which clearly indicate a shallow water lake depositional model This together with access to a good-quality regional dataset should allow for identification of the more subtle traps that have not been targeted and which may be ignored by companies aiming to only explore the clear analogues to discoveries so far Huge additional potential is indicated by this model painting a very exciting future for a well-informed exploration campaign

well-log domains are available in the literature being the flow zone indicator FZI method the most common used in both clastic and carbonate reservoirs Extrapolating the flow units rock typing from the core and well-log scales into the whole reservoir is a major challenge due to the lack of correlation with sedimentological facies and available data scale differences Most 3D generations of flow

re covery production For any asset team working in complex geology settings as Brazilian presalt carbonates an assertive description of reservoir heterogeneity and flow behavior in terms of fluid movement is crucial In that sense working with flow units in carbonate settings can present an advantage over sedimentary or lithological facies as it pro vides better estimation of reservoir petrophysical characteristics In the presence of complex geological settings with differential diagenesis the estimation of porosity and permeability k performed on a flow unit FU basis should be more accurate than lithological or sedimentary facies as discussed by Aggoun et al 2006 Daraei et al 2017 Hatampour et al 2018 Ghanbarian et al 2019 Because flow units do not have any correlation with lithological facies their incorporation into 3D static models that are essentially built on sedimentological premises can be very disappointing Depending on the diagenetic history same lithological facies deposited at a given highenergy setting for example can present distinct flow behavior These rocks would group at the same sedimentological facies but at different reservoir rock typing RRT and flow units because of the distinct porosity generation obliteration processes In addition the difference in scales and the lack of correlation between well logs and seismic data makes the propagation of the petrophysical properties into 3D geolog ical model problematic and purely a geostatistical approach often resulting in non-realistic flow models Examples of lateral extrapolations of flow units and petrophysical properties considering only well data are found in Testerman 1962 Svirsky et al 2004 and Li et al 2018 Flow units are rarely a considered technique for geophysicists Corresponding

High-resolution stratigraphy and characterization of reservoir-critical heterogeneities in the giant Tupi Field pre-salt Santos Basin Brazil Saulo Pedrinha and Victor de Mello Artag o Petrobras S A Reservoir Team Centro Empresarial Senado Av Henrique Valadares 28 Centro Rio de Janeiro RJ CEP 20231-030 Brazil SP 0000-0003-3325-2020 Correspondence saulo pedrinha petrobras com br Abstract The large oil discoveries that have occurred in recent decades in the pre-salt section of the South Atlantic sedimentary basins have promoted a signi cant volume of scienti c research regarding the origin of these deposits Most of the current studies of this stratigraphic interval focus on regional aspects or sedimentological and diagenetic processes However few studies encompass the geological characteristics of the pre-salt deposits from a reservoir-scale perspective This work addresses the construction of a detailed reservoir-oriented stratigraphic framework for the giant Tupi Field Discovered in 2006 following a successful exploratory campaign in the southeastern Brazilian deep-water the Tupi Field s main reservoirs are sag-phase carbonates from the Aptian-aged Barra Velha Formation These rocks accumulated in alkaline to highly alkaline lacustrine settings which allowed the development of unusual syngenetic elements such as magnesian clays calcitic spherulites and calcitic shrubs The reservoirs depositional organization was essentially conditioned by climatic oscillations and tectonic activity which controlled sedimentation rates and accommodation styles through space and time The high-resolution stratigraphic framework established in this article supports a detailed understanding at different scales of the Tupi Field s sedimentological evolution and its main vertical and lateral facies distribution These aspects have in turn provided essential inputs for reservoir characterization and constrained critical heterogeneities of the 3D geocellular model even in reservoirs affected by diagenetic processes Scienti c and technological advances in the early 2000s regarding seismic data quality geological knowledge and the capability to drill in deeper waters allowed exploration of the Aptian lacustrine carbonate reservoirs underlying the thick over 2000 m evaporites offshore of southeastern Brazil In this context the successful Santos Basin pre-salt play exploratory campaign discovered the giant Tupi accumulation in 2006 The economic importance of this world-class discovery can be understood by its estimated recoverable volumes between 5 and 8 billion barrels of oil equivalent which would be c 50 of the total hydrocarbon reserves of Brazil at that time In recent decades there have been several other discoveries in the pre-salt play in the Brazilian Santos and Campos basins as well as in the western African basins Driven by the economic signi cance of these discoveries progress has been made in understanding the geological aspects at the exploration scale However few studies have discussed the geological characteristics of pre-salt reservoirs at an adequate scale to guide oil production In this sense high-resolution stratigraphic analysis at an oil eld scale is fundamental to understanding the reservoirs main depositional controls and how these rocks are three-dimensionally distributed which ultimately allows for a better understanding of how petrophysical property variations affect the reservoir s uid dynamics and thus supports a more robust development production and management plan This work aims to address the reservoir aspects of the Barra Velha Formation deposits in the Tupi Field at an oil eld scale in order to construct a highresolution stratigraphic framework This framework will support a detailed understanding of the depositional evolution of the studied area and provide essential inputs for the characterization and geocellular 3D modelling of the reservoirs including their critical heterogeneities Geological setting The Santos Basin located in the SE region of the Brazilian continental margin Fig 1 encompasses c 350 000 km2 It is separated in the north from the Campos Basin by

gradual thickening basinwards suggesting minor fault activity during their sedimentation Fig 1d Barra Velha Formation depositional controls and dynamics Recent studies characterized the pre-salt section of the eastern Brazilian and western African basins and have allowed for a better understanding of these exotic and unique deposits Terra et al 2010 Dorobek et al 2012 Wright and Barnett 2015 Herlinger 2016 Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Some authors interpret a signi cant marine in uence during the Barra Velha Formation sedimentation especially because it is immediately underlying a thick evaporite section characteristic of a protooceanic environment Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2008 Nevertheless the geochemical analysis carried out by Pietzsch et al 2018 and supported by radiogenic strontium data indicates that the deposition of the carbonates in the Barra Velha Formation is associated with a lacustrine environment Wright and S Pedrinha and V M Artag o Barnett 2015 also suggested that these deposits have a dominantly lacustrine origin This interpretation according to the authors is based on an extensive analysis of cores and thin-sections where they found 1 scarce fossiliferous content with the presence of non-marine ostracods and phosphatic fragments 2 the absence of marine fossils including those typical of a restricted marine environment such as miliolid foraminifera 3 an abundant presence of magnesian clay minerals common in alkaline lakes under the in uence of volcanic terrains and 4 the absence of sulfates such as anhydrite or gypsum that would be expected in a restricted environment under a marine in uence Other works such as those by Saller et al 2016 Herlinger 2016 and Ceraldi and Green 2017 analysed the rocks of the sag section of the Kwanza and Campos basins which are chronologically correlated with the deposits of the Barra Velha Formation The lithotypes identi ed there are very similar to those described by Wright and Barnett 2015 which also supports the interpretation of these deposits as having been dominantly accumulated in a lacustrine setting The rock samples studied in the present work have similar characteristics to those cited by the authors mentioned above which supports a lacustrine interpretation for the Barra Velha Formation deposits Therefore lake dynamics had a strong in uence on the deposition of these rocks Compared to marine environments lakes are systems with lower volumes of water and consequently are much more sensitive to climate Bohacs et al 2000 Wet and dry periods directly in uence a lake s level sedimentation rate and the available space for sediment accumulation i e accommodation Fig 3 When the precipitation rates exceed the evaporation rates in wet periods the volume of water brought in by rivers increases which is directly proportional to the external in ux of sediments the water volume that raises the lake level is responsible for an increase in accommodation and the expansion of its margins When evaporation rates exceed precipitation rates in dry periods external sediment input decreases as rivers become less vigorous or even dry During these periods the lake tends to retract exposing previously subaqueous areas and its water depth tends to decrease restricting accommodation Owing to the decrease in the lake s water volume dry periods promote an increase in alkalinity and salinity and develop chemical and biogenic carbonate facies Facies analysis The Tupi Field currently has more than 100 drilled wells Fig 1 making it the largest reservoir Fig 3 Main lacustrine sedimentation variables and controls over a full climatic cycle There is a direct link between external

enhanced the comprehension of the main depositional processes and factors in uencing the distribution of facies in this speci c interval of the eld Main facies components The Barra Velha Formation rocks were deposited in a stressed lacustrine setting during the South Atlantic Ocean opening and are commonly composed of calcitic shrubs Chafetz and Folk 1984 calcitic spherulites magnesian clay minerals and intraclasts generated by the physical reworking of these elements Other observed components are transitional types between calcitic spherulites and calcitic shrubs microcrystalline calcite ostracod bioclasts and various detrital siliciclastic constituents with different compositions and grain sizes and show vertical to subvertical growth varying in size from 1 to 20 mm They sometimes have wellmarked internal laminations Fig 4 Calcitic spherulites Calcitic spherulites have spherical to sub-spherical forms and usually a well-preserved bro-radial texture They range in size from 0 1 to 2 mm commonly having a micritic nucleus or more rarely a bioclastic nucleus These components primarily occur by displacing and deforming magnesian clay aggregates suggesting that calcitic spherulites grow after clay deposition and are thus of diagenetic origin Fig 5 Transitional types between calcitic spherulites and calcitic shrubs Transitional types including asymmetric spherulites and incipient shrubs that grow from spherulitic forms also occur in the Barra Velha Formation Fig 6 These elements are commonly laterally amalgamated and coalesced forming crustiform textures Calcitic shrubs Magnesian clay minerals The term shrub describes an external calcitic morphology similar to the branching of woody plants without any genetic consideration Chafetz and Folk 1984 The observed shrubs are formed by fascicular-optical calcite aggregates Kendall 1977 Magnesian clays occur mainly as massive or laminated aggregates often dolomitized silici ed or dissolved and are predominantly associated with calcitic spherulites which displace and deform their laminations These aggregates occur commonly Fig 4 a Shrubs formed by fascicular calcite aggregates showing vertical growth porosity

components discussion The observed calcitic shrubs in this study are like those classi ed by Chafetz and Guidry 1999 as ray crystal shrubs and interpreted as being a product of abiotic processes The authors associate these elements with high rates of CO2 loss and high saturation environments providing very high rates of calcium carbonate precipitation Moreira et al 2007 interpreted these constituents as being a product of biological activity and related calcitic shrubs to microbial stromatolite deposition The occurrence of calcitic spherulites is observed in several recent carbonate environments Buczynski and Chafetz 1993 Verrecchia et al 1995 Spadafora et al 2010 Bahniuk et al 2015 However their origin has been widely debated over recent years Dupraz et al 2009 emphasized the role of organic matrices in calcium carbonate mineralization controlling the crystals morphology and their mineralogy According to the authors biological processes in uence the calcitic spherulite genesis where metabolic activity of bacteria creates a favourable environment for precipitation The results from Tutulo and Tosca s 2018 studies also provided a robust constraint on the geochemistry of Mg-silicate carbonate interactions during alkaline lake sedimentation leaving open the potential for biological contributions to sedimentation within the pre-salt basins Mercedes-Mart n et al 2016 through experimental analysis have demonstrated that in saline and alkaline solutions containing organic acids which are common in microbial mats calcitic spherulites can precipitate However the observed particle size c 0 02 mm is signi cantly smaller than similar components observed in our study Mercedes-Mart n et al 2016 also observed that supersaturated solutions do not precipitate spherulitic calcium carbonate forms The growth of spherulites is favoured by a higher concentration of magnesium and silica in very alkaline solutions associated with increased rates of calcite crystallization with or without microbial in uence and especially in a viscous media Garcia-Ruiz 2000 Sanchez-Navas et al 2009 Beck and Andreassen 2010 Meister et al 2011 Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 proposed an abiotic precipitation mechanism for the calcitic spherulites observed in the Barra Velha Formation Hydrated gels rich in silica and magnesium as mentioned by Tosca and Masterson 2014 as possible precursors of magnesian clay aggregates would be an ideal realm for the nucleation and growth of these components The transition types between calcitic spherulites and calcitic shrubs indicates a continuous process for generating these components Saller et al 2016 reported the occurrence of hybrid components between spherulites and shrubs in the Aptian section of the Kwanza Basin which is very similar to those observed in our study Saller et al 2016 interpreted the spherulites as developing inside muddy sediments in low-energy environments while the shrubs precipitate in higher energy and supersaturated environments The hybrid forms are associated with transitional environments between these two physicochemical conditions Several authors report syngenetic magnesian clay minerals in alkaline and saline lacustrine environments Millot 1970 Darragi and Tardy 1987 Calvo et al 1999 Clay minerals can occur in the form of stevensite sepiolite palygorskite saponite kerolite and talc Darragi and Tardy 1987 Carramal et al 2022 depending on the chemical conditions of the lake water Herlinger s 2016 analysis of the Macabu Formation deposits Campos Basin which are chronologically equivalent to the Barra Velha Formation suggests a predominantly stevensitic composition for the observed clays Tosca and Masterson 2014 observed that the occurrence of a gel and not a crystalline-structured clay mineral is associated with the initial stages of stevensite precipitation Such evidence is relevant to understanding this gel s potential to nucleate minerals and therefore to interpreting magnesian clay distribution in lacustrine deposits These gels are unlikely to stay preserved in high-energy environments under the in uence of waves currents or regions susceptible to subaerial exposure Tosca and Wright 2018 Sedimentary facies Six facies associations were recognized in the Tupi Field reservoirs based on their depositional environment energy depth and chemistry of lake water laminated mudstones LM spherulitic claystones SC in situ carbonates with well-developed shrublike texture InSitu-shrubs incipient shrub-like and or crust-like in situ carbonates InSitu-incip reworked carbonates RC and reworked carbonates with detrital siliciclastic content RC-si Laminated mudstones Laminated mudstones LM are characterized on a macroscopic scale by a millimetric alternation of light-coloured layers and brownish to greenish layers The light-coloured layers are silt to clay in grain size and carbonate calcitic and dolomitic in composition In contrast the brownish to greenish layers are organic-rich and associated with silt to clay detrital siliciclastic constituents The observed S Pedrinha and V M Artag o laminations are crenulated or at the former being much more common One of the most singular aspects of these facies is the common presence of silica occurring in centimetric to decimetric layers Fig 7 At a microscopic scale carbonate layers may exhibit an irregular and discontinuous appearance and are commonly recrystallized Silt-sized detrital siliciclastic constituents typically occur Locally concentrated levels of phosphatic bioclast fragments and dispersed ostracods compose the fossiliferous content Fig 8 Clay intervals have different proportions of silt and very ne sand composed of quartz micas feldspars and opaque and greenish minerals When the proportion of detrital siliciclastic material is high these layers become greenish and magnesian clays generally occur Spherulitic claystones Spherulitic claystones SC are characterized on a macroscopic scale by magnesian clay aggregates that commonly occur associated with calcitic spherulites A brownish to greenish colour is the most frequent with a large variation in the proportion of spherulites to clay matrix forming a wackestone-like texture when spherulite levels are concentrated causing amalgamation The proportion of spherulites typically increases towards the top of the layers resulting in a laminated appearance to the rock due to the alternating proportions Fig 9 It is possible to see that the spherulites displace and deform the magnesian clay aggregates at a microscopic scale The clays are often dolomitized and commonly associated with detrital siliciclastic mud content Fig 5 The characteristics observed in the spherulitic claystones are similar to those reported in the study on magnesium silicates in the Tupi Field conducted by Carramal et al 2022 In situ carbonates with well-developed shrub-like texture The InSitu-shrubs facies association is de ned by the presence of vertical to subvertical growth of welldeveloped shrub-like elements 2 mm which eventually exhibit a primary texture

than 10 siliciclastic content are classi ed as RC facies while those with greater than 10 siliciclastic content are classi ed as reworked carbonates with siliciclastic content RC-si facies In situ carbonates with incipient shrub-like and or crust-like texture Sedimentary facies discussion The predominance of incipient calcitic shrub elements 2 mm often containing spherulites that can amalgamate and form crust-rich horizons Fig 11 characterizes the in situ carbonates with incipient shrub-like and or crust-like texture InSitu-incip facies This facies usually occurs in a transition from SC to InSitu-shrubs Fig 6 Reworked carbonates and reworked carbonates with siliciclastic content The reworked carbonates RC facies are predominantly composed of fragments of calcitic spherulites and or calcitic shrubs with grain sizes varying from ne sand to pebble but more commonly made up of coarse to very coarse sand Peloids ostracod bioclasts magnesian clays and detrital siliciclastic constituents igneous rock clasts also occur Figs 12 13 The RC facies often exhibit moderate sorting and massive textures They present planar tabular tangential or low-angle cross-strati cation structures The detrital siliciclastic content of the reworked carbonates is used to de ne two subtypes of facies The genesis of laminated mudstones is related to low-energy environments where the main depositional process involved is settling from suspension Secondly irregular laminations of carbonate levels may indicate possible microbial activity In this sense the crenulated laminations may indicate more signi cant microbial activity than the at ones Demicco and Hardie 1994 The observed silica layers associated with the laminated mudstones are related to syngenetic precipitation and indicate dilution of the lake waters The input of meteoric water during wet periods causes a decrease in the pH promoting the precipitation of the previously dissolved silica associated with periods of higher water concentration and alkalinity Wright and Barnett 2015 Spherulitic claystones are associated with lowenergy lake waters with high alkalinity and a large silica and magnesium content that allowed the magnesian clay minerals to precipitate and accumulate with or without the in uence of microbial substrates Tosca and Masterson 2014 In turn these sediments served as an ideal medium for spherulite nucleation since the occurrence of magnesian clays without the presence of these constituents is rare S Pedrinha and V M Artag o Fig 9 a b Bottom to the top trend of an increasing proportion of spherulitic and incipient shrubs constituents The laminated aspect is present due to the intercalation of levels with different proportions of spherulites c Slightly greenish colour of the matrix indicates the presence of detrital siliciclastic mud The commonly observed upward trend of an increase in the proportion of spherulites indicates a progressive evolution of the lake water s physicochemical characteristics The occurrence of ne-grained detrital siliciclastic material associated with the clay aggregates and spherulites suggests that even during wet periods when the external sediment input to the water body is higher the lake chemistry has remained prone to the precipitation of these constituents Abiotic precipitation in a moderate-to-highenergy subaquatic environment represents the main deposition process for the InSitu-shrubs facies The observed shrub elements similar to ray crystal shrubs Chafetz and Guidry 1999 indicate rapid precipitation probably induced by very high pH values and high rates of CO2 degassing Therefore this suggests deposition during dry periods when the high evaporation rates induce a progressive increase in the salinity and alkalinity of the lake water and in relatively higher energy environments where the agitation of the water promotes CO2 degassing and carbonate precipitation The absence of fossils possibly due to the extreme salinity and alkalinity conditions the lower proportions of associated magnesian clays or detrital siliciclastic material and the often-observed subaerial exposure features like brecciation and dissolution also support The giant Tupi Field high-resolution stratigraphy Fig 10 a c Well-developed in situ shrub-like textures Notice the slightly domal geometry in b d Primary texture of InSitu-shrubs facies strongly modi ed by dissolution processes related to subaerial exposure the proposed sedimentological interpretation for these facies The InSitu-incip facies are formed in an intermediate physicochemical environment to those necessary for forming SC and InSitu-shrubs The occurrence of less-developed calcitic elements can also be interpreted as a function of the space available for precipitation i e accommodation which may be signi cantly reduced depending on the lake s physiography and its related water depth In terms of processes the presence of small shrubs that form millimetric crusts and are commonly associated with spherulite-rich levels indicates carbonate precipitation that starts inside the muddy sediments spherulites and that progressively moves above the sediment water surface shrubs The presence of cross-strati cation structures and fragments of calcitic spherulites calcitic shrubs and detrital siliciclastic constituents indicate that the main sedimentary processes related to the genesis S Pedrinha and V M Artag o Fig 11 a b Incipient calcitic shrubs amalgamate laterally and form crust horizons yellow arrow Calcitic spherulitic constituents are also commonly observed in the InSitu-incip facies of the RC and RC-si facies are interpreted as being a product of subaqueous tractive ow in a high-tomoderate-energy environment associated with the action of currents and waves Palaeoenvironmental interpretation Lithofacies analysis supports a model for the occurrence of facies in the Tupi Field area that considers the relationships between parameters like water depth energy levels and distance to the local lake margin Fig 14 However lake-level uctuations acted as a control on these parameters variability through space and time giving origin to a complex lateral and vertical shift in facies and hiatuses in the geological record LM and SC facies developed in a low-energy environment with relatively deeper water depths Higher allogenic ne-grained detrital siliciclastic content and the presence of tabular silica levels interpreted as syngenetic and associated with a decrease in the lake water pH suggest that the LM facies can be correlated with a wet climate Spherulitic claystones and their associated syngenetic magnesian clays and calcitic spherulites suggest a relatively higher pH alkaline and higher ion concentration in the lake water Tosca and Wright 2018 However the common presence of detrital siliciclastic constituents indicates deposition under a moderately wet climate with consequently an external input of sediments into the system InSitu-shrubs developed under high-tomoderate-energy environments located in shallower water depths Dry periods and CO2 degassing related to water agitation favoured the ideal chemical conditions that induced the precipitation of fascicular forms of calcium carbonate directly on the lake substrate The intermediate physicochemical conditions between SC and InSitu-shrubs triggered the accumulation of InSitu-incip facies Extremely reduced water depths which prevented the more effective growth of the fascicular forms can also explain incipient carbonate facies The presence of sedimentary structures related to bedload transport and the composition of the RC and RC-si constituents indicate high-to-moderate-energy conditions associated with the action of waves and currents in shallow water depths The trigger for the genesis of these deposits occurs during wet periods when the water in ux promoted the input of sediments into the system especially near the lake margin where particles generated by subaerial exposure were available Sandy to conglomeratic detrital siliciclastic constituents composed predominantly of igneous clasts indicate the existence of emerged areas with volcanic deposits associated with intrabasinal structural highs inherited from rift tectonism Thick and extensive deposits of reworked carbonates are observed in the Tupi Field particularly in the structurally higher regions This occurs because the shorelines of lakes are relatively narrower compared to marine environments due to limited wave action fetch that creates a shallow wave base This effect is ampli ed in low-gradient lakes where rapid uctuations in lake levels prevent the establishment of a stable shoreline Barnett et al 2018 The preservation of the magnesian clays is mainly controlled by environmental depositional energy As The giant Tupi Field high-resolution stratigraphy Fig 12 a b Macroscopic aspects of the reworked carbonates RC facies

Field high-resolution stratigraphy High-resolution sequence stratigraphy Sequence stratigraphy has a fundamental criterion the analysis of changes in sedimentary facies stacking patterns caused by variations in accommodation and sediment supply rates over time These changes give rise to stratigraphic surfaces that mark important modi cations in the sedimentation regime which are relevant for stratigraphic correlation and understanding the sedimentary evolution in a given area Catuneanu 2006 Nowadays a consensus is that a sequence the fundamental sequence stratigraphy unit can be limited by any two stratigraphic surfaces both having the same genesis thus bounding a complete sedimentary cycle In this way a succession of strata deposited during a full cycle of accommodation or sedimentary supply variation de nes a sequence Such de nition is generic independent of models and encompasses all types of sequences that can develop at any spatial or temporal scale Catuneanu et al 2011 More pragmatically considering elements observed in the geological record a sequence could also be conceived of as a succession of strata that presents a complete cycle of facies stacking pattern variation being limited by stratigraphic surfaces Catuneanu and Zecchin 2013 The concept of a sequence is particularly reinforced when its areal mappability can be demonstrated and the repeatability of its stacking patterns in the vertical section can be veri ed Fragoso et al 2021 The analysis of the facies stacking patterns observed in the Barra Velha Formation in the Tupi Field allows the recognition of sequences at different scales The different sequence scales identi ed do not have at rst any absolute temporal connotation embedded in their de nitions corresponding only to stacking pattern variations with different vertical extents However the changes in environmental conditions responsible for sequence discretization occurred at different scales of time and space Elementary sequences A facies succession corresponding to the smallest recognizable cycle of environmental change characterizes an elementary sequence Strasser et al 1999 Based on the interpretation of the processes related to the main identi ed sedimentary facies and their stacking pattern analysis three main elementary sequence types are de ned Type 1 Type 2 and Type 3 elementary sequences Fig 15 The Type 1 elementary sequence is organized in the vertical from base to top as follows thick packages of reworked carbonates with siliciclastic content RC-si in situ carbonates with incipient shrub-like and or crust-like texture InSitu-incip and in situ carbonates with well-developed shrublike texture InSitu-shrubs These sequences commonly present features of subaerial exposure at the top and in terms of dimensions commonly have decimetric and rarely metric thicknesses The observed vertical facies succession for the Type 2 elementary sequence is from base to top as follows packages of reworked carbonates RC laminated mudstones LM spherulitic claystones SC in situ carbonates with incipient shrub-like and or crust-like texture InSitu-incip and in situ carbonates with well-developed shrub-like texture InSitu-shrubs Type 2 elementary sequences commonly present subaerial exposure features at the top and have a thickness of decimetric and rarely metric dimensions The Type 3 elementary sequence presents a vertical facies arrangement from base to top as follows thin packages of reworked carbonates RC laminated mudstones LM spherulitic claystones SC and in situ carbonates with incipient shrub-like and or crust-like texture InSitu-incip Subordinately in situ carbonates with well-developed shrub-like texture InSitu-shrubs are observed punctuating the top of these sequences A relevant characteristic of this sequence is the abundant presence of subaerial exposure features with the development of dissolution and brecciation that especially affects the InSitu-incip and InSitu-shrubs facies The observed thickness dimensions of the Type 3 elementary sequence are commonly decimetric and rarely metric High-resolution sequence stratigraphy discussion The identi ed elementary sequence facies successions can be interpreted in terms of a complete lakelevel variation curve representing the highest frequency cycle of environmental variation identi ed in the Tupi Field area Fig 15 Lacustrine sedimentary dynamics were the control mechanisms for forming the elementary sequences and consequently it is possible to identify two sedimentation regimes in its geological record Precipitation rates exceeding evaporation rates initiated the wet sedimentation regime that gradually increased accommodation and promoted the lake s areal expansion The rainfall water in ux and its associated sediments progressively reduced water alkalinity and salinity decreasing carbonate precipitation rates This regime was prone to the deposition of reworked constituents which were transported into the lake by rainfall water and low-energy facies due to the increased water depth Evaporation rates exceeding precipitation rates established the dry sedimentation regime and promoted the lake s retraction The progressive water volume reduction increased the lake alkalinity and salinity favouring the precipitation of in situ facies since its components especially S Pedrinha and V M Artag o Fig 15 Elementary sequence representations for Barra Velha Formation deposits in the Tupi Field Due to the short period involved in their deposition subsidence is considered constant the well-developed shrubs have a predominantly chemical genesis The lake-level fall linked to high evaporation and carbonate precipitation rates was responsible for the progressive reduction in accommodation and the lake s retraction in the dry sedimentation regime leading to the generation of subaerial exposure features The presence of the RC-si facies and the absence of low-energy facies LM and SC facies during the wet sedimentation regime characterize the Type 1 elementary sequence These aspects suggest high-to-moderate-energy conditions throughout the whole development of this sequence even in high lake-level periods It means that high-frequency The giant Tupi Field high-resolution stratigraphy lake-level variations could not signi cantly shift the lake margin maintaining constant and elevated energy conditions over time at the basin s analysed position The presence of igneous constituents implies the existence of exposed intrabasinal volcanic structural highs and in addition to the small lateral variation of the water body margin points to a lake with a complex palaeotopography with a relatively higher relief The substantial development of InSitu-shrubs facies characterizes the Type 2 elementary sequence indicating deposition in waters with relatively higher alkalinity and ionic concentration The commonly observed presence of LM and SC facies in the wet sedimentation regime indicates a low-energy environment during the lake expansion periods Highfrequency lake-level variations combined with a lower relief lake palaeotopography allowed signi cant lateral shifts of the lake margin effectively changing from lower to higher energy conditions over short periods The occurrence of low-energy facies mostly laminated mudstones associated with lake expansion periods and the common presence of subaerial exposure features usually affecting the InSitu-shrubs or InSitu-incip facies during lake retraction comprise the main aspects of the Type 3 elementary sequence This alternation low-energy facies during expansion and extensive subaerial exposure features during retraction suggests another con guration in the lake s topographic condition Very low-relief basin physiography allowed high-frequency lakelevel variations to signi cantly shift its margin drastically changing the lake s areal extent and the regions on which sedimentary processes acted during wet and dry periods The lower relative proportion of InSitu-shrubs facies may also indicate a more diluted water body with lower alkalinity than the other sequences From the sequence stratigraphy perspective two essential surfaces can be identi ed within an elementary sequence and related to a lake-level variation curve The maximum expansion surface MES marks the moment when the distance between the centre of the lake and its margin reaches its maximum The MES also represents the moment when the sedimentation rate starts to exceed accommodation From this point on the facies stacking pattern changes showing a shallowing upward pattern This modi cation marks the beginning of lake retraction and a progressive water depth reduction characterizing the retracting lake regime facies tract RLRT The second stratigraphic surface identi ed is the maximum retraction surface MRS This surface expresses the moment when the distance between the centre of the lake and its margin reaches its minimum The MRS also records the moment when accommodation starts to exceed sedimentation rate After this point the facies stacking pattern changes showing a deepening upward pattern that indicates the beginning of the lake expansion and the progressive increase in water depth characterizing the expanding lake regime facies tract ELRT The geological record encompasses numerous sequences which have different origins and are related to a broad spectrum of temporal and spatial scales therefore a hierarchization in terms of their nested patterns becomes fundamental The sequence hierarchical method is independent of the time involved and the base level variation magnitude and its allogeneic controls Catuneanu 2006 In this approach the relative importance of the events that lead to sequence boundary development is primarily measured by analysing the facies stacking patterns that emerged from a balance between accommodation and sedimentation rates that consequently produced depositional trends Following this logic the small-scale sequences high frequency usually having a thickness of a few metres embrace a set of elementary sequences very high frequency usually decimetric in scale Fig 16 Groups of small-scale sequences form the so-called medium-scale sequences medium-frequency which are tens of metres thick Finally an ensemble of medium-scale sequences composes the large-scale sequences low frequency with hundreds of metres in thickness Fig 17 The analysis of the facies proportion trends of the elementary sequences allows the identi cation of small-scale sequences Sedimentary successions showing a predominance of elementary sequences of ELRTs indicate a trend of water body dilution induced by high rainfall rates which caused a progressive expansion and lake-level rise during a smallscale sequence period An inversion of this stacking pattern represented by an increase in the proportion of elementary sequences of RLRTs de nes the small-scale sequence MES From this point on an increase in the lake water alkalinity associated with high evaporation rates resulted in a progressive retraction and lake-level fall in a small-scale sequence span The small-scale sequence MRS records another inversion in this stacking pattern where the proportion of ELRTs starts to increase This surface symbolizes the minimum accommodation within a small-scale sequence formation period The largeand medium-scale sequences were de ned using the same logic as the small-scale sequences being identi ed by analysing the facies proportion trends associated with periods of lake expansion and retraction in the medium- and small-scale sequences Reservoir zonation The analysis of sequence stacking patterns and the correlation of

stratigraphic surfaces across all drilled wells strongly supported by seismic data well logs and rock data allowed for the construction of a high-resolution stratigraphic framework The key medium-scale sequences identi ed were tracked and correlated within the reservoir composing the stratigraphic zones of the Tupi Field The established reservoir zonation provides the background to understand the reservoir s depositional evolution and three-dimensional facies variation ultimately supporting the prediction of petrophysical properties and the spatial distribution of heterogeneity Magalh es et al 2020 Inherited structural features from the rift tectonic phase along with some post-rift fault reactivation in uenced the lateral thickness variation within the stratigraphic framework The older zones were deposited in a more complex lake palaeotopography related to faults and over time the accommodation space was being lled leading to a decrease in lake oor relief and gradually generating smaller thickness variations Fig 18 Depositional evolution The reservoir s depositional evolution reveals a gradual transformation in the lake palaeotopography associated with the span of a large-scale sequence Artag o 2018 The recognized low-frequency lake modi cations re ect a balance between longterm changes in the tectonic activity and climate factors that affected accommodation potential and sedimentation rates through time Fig 19 The sedimentary record in the Tupi Field is composed of three large-scale sequences two of them being incomplete one at the base showing only its retracting lake regime one at the top of the Barra Velha Formation showing only the initial part of its expanding lake regime and one complete sequence The lowermost incomplete sequence onlaps structurally higher areas and is only observed in wells located in regions where the Barra Velha Formation thickens in the basinward direction Fig 18 The complete large-scale sequence observed in the area occurs in all the wells and comprises most of the eld s reservoir rocks It initiates with a lowfrequency expanding lake regime t1 Fig 19 This interval is overlying a signi cant erosive angular unconformity in most parts of the area and marks the top of the Itapema Formation The high proportion of medium-scale ELRTs and the occurrence of Type 1 elementary sequences characterize this rst sedimentation regime These observations suggest that important tectonic activity related to the rift phase of the basin affected the lake developing a relatively deeper water depth and higher relief palaeotopography which associated with a wetter period The giant Tupi Field high-resolution stratigraphy Fig 17 Examples of medium- and large-scale sequences and spectral gamma-ray GR logs Notice the change in facies proportions and their relationship to each sedimentological lake regime and the GR signatures Expanding lake regimes exhibit higher GR values mostly related to potassium and the detrital siliciclastic input Retracting lake regimes and the associated carbonate facies show lower GR values Facies associations RC-si reworked carbonates with siliciclastic content RC reworked carbonates InSitu-shrubs in situ carbonates with well-developed shrub-like texture InSitu-incip in situ carbonates with incipient shrub-like and or crust-like texture SC spherulitic claystones LM laminated mudstones provided a signi cant in ux of external sediments from emerged structural highs Afterwards a progressive increase in the proportion of medium-scale RLRTs and the occurrence of Type 2 elementary sequences mark the rst low-frequency retracting lake regime t2 Fig 19 During this period the continuous reduction in tectonic activity and the progressive increase in sedimentation rates of the InSitu-shrubs facies related to a low-frequency dry period gradually decreased the lake s relief and water depth The occurrence of Type 3 elementary sequences and an increase in the proportion of medium-scale ELRTs characterizes the following second lowfrequency expanding lake regime t3 Fig 19 The substantial accommodation lling from the previous S Pedrinha and V M Artag o Fig 18 Stratigraphic well-section across eight Tupi Field wells Notice the gamma-ray GR log s high-frequency pattern and its signature associated with the reservoir stratigraphic zones and lake sedimentation regimes Higher GR values are related to a large-scale maximum expansion surface while lower values represent a large-scale maximum retraction surface Higher clay mineral content is linked to a large-scale maximum expansion surface and structural lows in the eld for the same stratigraphic interval The giant Tupi Field high-resolution stratigraphy Fig 19 The evolution of the Tupi Field reservoir depositional system can be interpreted in terms of a large-scale sequence re ecting long-term changes in lake palaeotopography driven by tectonism and climate Facies associations RC-si reworked carbonates with siliciclastic content RC reworked carbonates InSitu-shrubs in situ carbonates with well-developed shrub-like texture InSitu-incip in situ carbonates with incipient shrub-like and or crust-like texture SC spherulitic claystones LM laminated mudstones sedimentary regime resulted in a very low lake relief with a drastic reduction in the space available for deposition during this period The very shallow lake water depth very low relief associated with a wetter climatic condition promoted extensive cyclic exposure features and diminished the InSitu-shrubs facies sedimentation rate The more diluted condition of the lake waters highlighted by the lower proportion of InSitu-shrubs facies in addition to the transition to the Ariri Formation evaporites at the top of this interval may indicate a marine in uence during this period of the lake s evolution Proportion curves were introduced at the end of the 1980s to assist in quantifying geological data for reservoir modelling and have proved to be a powerful tool for sequence stratigraphy analysis and for quantifying lithofacies Ravenne et al 2002 Moreover concerning reservoir characterization vertical proportion curves VPCs are one of the most important quantitative parameters affecting uid ow S Pedrinha and V M Artag o within a reservoir Lopez et al 2002 VPCs are 100 stacked bar charts of lithofacies or any other categorical variable computed layer by layer parallel to a reference stratigraphic surface that is related to a depositional horizon in a given sequence Computed from all available wells Tupi Field VPCs exhibit a large-scale facies proportion trend that illustrates the low-frequency depositional evolution that the authors have interpreted Fig 19 The rst low-frequency expanding lake regime t1 Fig 19 culminates in a large-scale maximum expansion surface MESLS and higher values in the gamma-ray GR logs These higher values re ect the high proportions of RC-si SC LM and magnesian-clay-rich sedimentary facies which represents a pragmatic approach that groups nonreservoir facies with preserved Mg-clays independent of their type The top of the low-frequency retracting lake regime t2 Fig 19 marks a large-scale maximum retraction surface MRSLS which is associated with a high proportion of InSitu-shrubs and InSitu-incip facies and with lower GR log values Subsequently another change in the vertical trend of facies occurs with the decrease in the proportion of InSitu-shrubs facies and an increase in the proportions of InSitu-incip and LM facies These facies proportion variations impact the GR signature of this interval which clearly shows an increase in its log values The calculated vertical curves also demonstrate the correspondence between the reservoir stratigraphic zonation and the vertical sedimentary trends The established reservoir zones correspond to the main medium-scale sequences identi ed and tracked within the Tupi Field and clearly show the logical trend of an increase in the proportion of InSitu-shrubs facies at the top of each sequence boundary Reservoir modelling The construction of a three-dimensional geological reservoir model represents one of the most signi cant phases in the work ow of a petroleum eld study in terms of both the volume of work involved and the impact on the results A reservoir s external and internal geometry and its related petrophysical heterogeneities from small to large scale are essential factors in determining a eld s production performance Cosentino 2001 The Tupi Field s three-dimensional reservoir modelling was performed by integrating the large amount of static data available such as rock samples sidewall and cores laboratory data well logs and seismic data with the dynamic information The background geological concepts served as an input for the reservoir modelling work ow as well as the ow simulation and history match used as an a priori constraint in the 3D model construction The high-resolution structural stratigraphic model was built combining the seismic interpretation and the established high-resolution stratigraphic framework which supported by a sedimentological conceptual background constrains the 3D facies modelling Since the de ned facies have different characteristics regarding their petrophysical properties the 3D facies model served as a constraint for the building of the 3D petrophysical model The construction and calibration of the 3D petrophysical model of the eld involved the use of seismic attributes thousands of core analysis samples and a robust collection of more than 15 years of dynamic data A rock-type spatial representation was de ned for the Tupi Field reservoir using the 3D petrophysical model The established 3D rock-type model encompasses classes of rocks deposited under similar conditions that experienced similar diagenetic processes resulting in a unique porosity permeability relationship capillary pressure pro le and water saturation for a given height above free water level in the reservoir Archie 1950 The entire set of constructed properties plays an important role as input for volumetrics and ow simulation studies and serves as a primary tool for development plans and active management of the reservoir Fig 20 VPCs demonstrate the impact of the reservoir zonation supported by a high-resolution stratigraphic Fig 20 Work ow for the 3D geological modelling of the Barra Velha Formation in the Tupi Field The giant Tupi Field high-resolution stratigraphy Fig 21 Tupi Field vertical

surfaces used in the high-resolution structural stratigraphic 3D model were de ned from a facies stacking pattern analysis the global vertical proportion of facies represented within the 3D reservoir model re ects this same organization Figs 19 21 For each individualized stratigraphic zone the VPCs show an upward trend of increases in the in situ facies and a decrease in low-energy facies which clearly imposes a strong control on the critical petrophysical properties expressed in the geological model Quality control for the geological model work ow is provided by comparing the VPCs related to the facies associations and petrophysical properties calculated from all wells and those calculated from the 3D model output The Tupi Field three-dimensional geological model maintains the same critical vertical heterogeneities observed in the wells Fig 21 con rming that a high-resolution stratigraphic framework and a seamless geological modelling work ow where all the available static and dynamic data serve as an integrated input provide a robust spatial representation of the reservoir s properties The common and diverse diagenetic processes that affected the Brazilian pre-salt reservoirs had an important role in modifying their primary petrophysical properties Herlinger 2016 Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 However the Tupi Field reservoirs petrophysical properties are mostly controlled by the distribution of the original facies associations In this sense establishing a highresolution stratigraphic framework was crucial because even in deposits strongly affected by diagenetic processes the three-dimensional sedimentary facies architecture signi cantly constrains the critical petrophysical heterogeneities of the reservoir Conclusions The Tupi Field s main reservoirs were deposited in a stressed lacustrine and alkaline environment which allowed for the development of unusual facies comprising magnesian clay minerals spherulitic and shrub-like calcitic constituents and the laminated mudstones and reworked carbonates facies that can occur associated with igneous rock fragments The interpretation of the processes involved in the genesis of the different facies associations and recognizing their limiting stratigraphic surfaces facilitated the construction of a depositional model that supports the identi cation of elementary sequences which are products of the smallest recognizable environmental variation in the studied area The same rationale used to de ne the small-scale sequences from variations in the facies proportion trends of the elementary sequences distinguishes the mediumscale and large-scale sequences in this case from the investigation of facies proportions in small- and medium-scale sequences respectively The correlation of the most traceable and relevant stratigraphic surfaces across all drilled wells supported by seismic data well logs and rock data allowed for the construction of a high-resolution stratigraphic framework and materialized the Tupi Field reservoir s zonation Sequence and facies stacking pattern analysis at different scales sustained the identi cation of a reservoir depositional model that evolved over a large-scale sequence span Longterm lake palaeotopographic variations related to the Santos Basin tectonic evolution in association with a broader climatic trend had a strong in uence on the sedimentological patterns and architecture of the Tupi Field reservoirs The established high-resolution stratigraphic framework and reservoir zonation served as an input for a robust geological model work ow integrating static and dynamic data It provided a fundamental constraint for facies architecture prediction and its related petrophysical properties For each Tupi Field stratigraphic zone the vertical proportion of facies exhibits a pattern re ecting the same logical construction used to de ne sequences at different scales Even for diagenetically affected rocks it imposes the most important control on the reservoir s critical petrophysical heterogeneities These advances in the reservoir characterization studies driven by a highresolution stratigraphic analysis and the applied integrated geological modelling work ow allowed for a robust understanding of the Tupi Field reservoirs critical heterogeneities which has been fundamental to its successful development High-resolution sequence stratigraphy is crucial and extremely valuable for the industry as it can offer insights and improve the comprehension of the permeability and porosity within a reservoir The methodology outlined in this study is applicable and has the potential to provide valuable insights reduce nancial risks and improve the chances of success for projects in the oil and gas sector as well as in emerging energies like geothermal sources or CCUS carbon capture utilization and storage where understanding reservoir characteristics is a fundamental requirement

M OLIVEIRA2 1 Geosciences Institute Rio Grande do Sul Federal University Porto Alegre RS Brazil 2 Petrobras Research Center CENPES Rio de Janeiro RJ Brazil email lfderos inf ufrgs br The giant Aptian reservoirs and associated lacustrine rocks of the South Atlantic pre-salt section present a series of unique characteristics which make the systems created for marine carbonate rocks quite inadequate for their classification Based on our experience with the characterization of thousands of samples of the pre-salt reservoirs and associated deposits from the Brazilian basins and on a wide literature evaluation we propose an objective and operational system for the classification of the unusual yet extremely important pre-salt lacustrine rocks The system allows the coherent record of structure fabric primary texture and composition and main diagenetic modifications of the in situ and resedimented rock types The in situ rocks are directly classified according to the original proportion among calcite spherulites fascicular shrubs and mud matrix The resedimented rocks are classified according to the original volume of 2 mm particles and the proportion between sand and mud using calcirudite calcarenite and calcilutite as unbiased names Such an approach can also be applied to the classification of other particulate carbonate rocks avoiding the conceptual problems and dubious interpretation of depositional environment and reservoir quality of currently used classification systems The direct objective and intuitive proposed classification system shall contribute to the understanding exploration and production of the extraordinary South Atlantic pre-salt petroleum province ABSTRACT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PRE-SALT ROCKS During the last fifteen years a series of giant hydrocarbon accumulations were discovered in very unusual Aptian reservoirs of the Santos Campos and Kwanza basins along the Brazilian and African South Atlantic margins e g Carminatti et al 2008 Wright and Barnett 2015 Saller et al 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Abelha and Petersohn 2018 Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Carvalho et al 2022 Wright 2022 These deposits were formed in a vast lacustrine system which probably covered more than 1 000 000 km2 along the large sag depression generated by the early separation between Africa and South America Davison 2007 Chaboureau et al 2013 Szatmari et al 2021 Fig 1 The tectonic setting which included extensive magmatism Szatmari and Milani 2016 associated hydrothermal activity Teboul et al 2017 Souza et al 2018 Lima et al 2020 and also potentially mantle exhumation Szatmari and Milani 2016 Pinto et al 2017 Wright 2022 and the arid climatic conditions Pietzsch et al 2020 Lawson et al 2022 created an alkaline lacustrine environment with elevated activities of Mg Ca Si Cl and HCO3 Under these conditions the in situ pre-salt deposits were generated by chemical precipitation in the water column as well as at or just below the lake bottom recorded by a combination of only three components magnesian clay matrix calcite spherulites and shrubs The background of the lacustrine sedimentation which represents the recurrent substrate for the precipitation of the other constituents in the depositional cycles consists of authigenic syngenetic magnesian phyllosilicates represented mostly by stevensite a magnesian smectite kerolite a hydrated form of talc or interstratified mixed layers between the two Published Online October 2023 Copyright 2023 SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology Carramal et al 2022 These minerals precipitated by homogeneous nucleation as clay-size particles that accumulated as low-energy laminated deposits Fig 2A or as silt- to fine sand-size peloids Fig 2B Some authors e g Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 suggest that these magnesian clays may have originally been deposited as a Mg-Si gel later crystallized However the voluminous and recurrent deposition of the Mg-clays would not be possible as a gel considering the extremely slow settling of colloidal particles Stokes Law Besides the excellent parallel orientation of the laminated deposits Fig 2C is incompatible with their crystallization from a gel and their deformation by the very early precipitation of calcite spherulites and shrubs just below sediment water interface indicates their original depositional parallel orientation The precipitation of the calcite spherulites commonly occurred very close to the sediment water interface as indicated by the common nucleation of shrubs on spherulites and by the occurrence of transitional forms such as asymmetric vertically elongated spherulites Mixed with the Mg-clays there are subordinate amounts of detrital clays transformed mostly to interstratified illite smectite on burial and silt quartz feldspars and micas mostly and rare ostracod and bacterial or algal bioclasts The laminated Mg-clays were heterogeneously often strongly replaced by microcrystalline dolomite silica and dominantly calcite Fig 2D thus their misidentification as carbonate mud deposits in several published works Wright and

spherulites such as asymmetrical and lobate spherulites and shrubs nucleated on spherulites are quite common Fig 3E indicating that the two forms were precipitated from the same fluids with intra-sediment eodiagenetic formation of the spherulites while the shrubs formed both within and on the sediments The shrubs and their interstitial Mg-clays were exposed to the same diagenetic modifications observed in the spherulitic rocks Fig 3F Besides forming the in situ deposits these constituents also occur as intraclasts in important and commonly extensive reworked deposits which constitute the main pre-salt reservoirs in some areas as in the B zios Field Ferreira et al 2021a 2021b Such deposits are composed of reworked spherulites Fig 4A fragments of shrubs Fig 4B and

CARBONATE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS The most widely used carbonate classification system cf Lokier and Al Junaibi 2016 is that initially proposed by Dunham 1962 later complemented by Embry and Klovan 1971 and revisited by Wright 1992 In this system carbonate rocks are subdivided into three main categories The first is represented by particulate allochthonous or depositional types grainstone packstone wackestone mudstone rudstone floatstone composed of different proportions of allochem particles bioclasts ooids oncoids peloids pellets and intraclasts and carbonate mud particulate depositional constituents 20 mm sensu Dunham 1962 or 30 mm sensu Embry and Klovan 1971 The second corresponds to constructed autochthonous or biological rocks framestone bafflestone and bindstone or boundstone made by organisms like corals which are originally bound together during deposition The third corresponds to crystalline or diagenetic types in which original constituents are either not recognizable owing to intense recrystallization or dolomitization sparite or sparstone dolostone or strongly modified by compaction fitted or condensed limestone or that are mainly made of

intraclasts stained pink with primary interparticle porosity together with secondary intraparticle porosity P Another classification system commonly used for carbonate is that modified from Grabau 1904 and Bramkamp and Powers 1958 which subdivides rocks into particulate types calcilutite calcarenite and calcirudite according to the proportion and size of the allochems and of carbonate mud bioconstructed biolithite and strongly recrystallized or dolomitized types Another well-known although comparatively less used system is that of Folk 1959 1962 who created synthetic names combining prefixes for the types of allochems a middle name for the interstitial presence of calcite cement spar or micritic matrix and a suffix for the size of the allochems e g biointramicrudite for a rock made of large bioclasts and intraclasts and micritic matrix and proposed biolithite for bioherm rocks Bissel and Chilingar 1967 made an extensive review of the carbonate classifications up to that date The Embry and Klovan 1971 system contains significant conceptual confusion as the term rudstone is proposed for carbonate rocks containing more than 10 of allochems larger than 2 mm and being supported by them As more than 30 of such 2 mm particles would be needed to support the fabric of a particulate rock Folk 1968 many rudstones would not be actually supported by the gravel-size particles Another confusing concept of the Embry and Klovan 1971 classification concerns the class floatstone proposed for rocks containing more than 10 of allochems larger than 2 mm but supported by any type of finer-grained carbonate material comprising carbonate sand mud or a mix of these This was also acknowledged and criticized by Wright 1992 As the depositional energy and the porosity of a floatstone with micritic matrix is obviously very different from one with a carbonate sand matrix this classification is dubious regarding both the interpretation of depositional environment and of reservoir quality The Dunham 1962 and the Embry and Klovan 1971 classification system present serious conceptual problems and their application even by experienced carbonate petrologists is problematic and contradictory see e g Lokier and Al Junaibi 2016 Nevertheless the characteristic in situ pre-salt rocks composed by Mg-clays matrix calcite spherulites and shrubs clearly cannot be framed within any of the classical classification systems designed for marine carbonates WHY ANOTHER PRE-SALT CLASSIFICATION Terra et al 2010 published in Portuguese the first classification system

categories with confusing and or redundant classes Some examples of such issues include 1 the loose definition of stromatolite for rocks with structure not only stratified or laminated but also dendriform arborescent or shrubby in contradiction to the Riding 2000 classification for microbial carbonates and together with the redundant terms boundstone and dendrolite 2 the loose definitions of travertine and tufa 3 the use of the Dunham 1962 and the Embry and Klovan 1971 wackestone packstone and floatstone names for pre-salt rocks devoid of carbonate mud with Mg-clay depositional matrix and in which the associated carbonate components are in some cases spherulitic calcite aggregates that are diagenetic in origin and 4 the definition of laminites as fine-grained carbonate rocks with microbial origin and thin smooth or crenulated lamination which are actually replaced Mg-clay deposits The system proposed by Wright and Barnett 2017 2020 is in general more correct However it is relatively complex with class names difficult to memorize and hard to relate to their specific rock types e g F1 2a2 F1c F5a etc Fig 5 Class names should be as much as possible at least mnemonic Besides their system presents some conceptual problems as the use of wackestone and packstone for resedimented rocks with Mg-clay matrix and devoid of carbonate mud and the interpretation of rocks originally consisting of Mg-clays later replaced by microcrystalline calcite and or dolomite as laminated carbonate mudstones their class F3 Detailed examination of the fine-grained laminated pre-salt rocks revealed that that they were generated by the diagenetic replacement of laminated Mg-clays by calcite dolomite or silica and not from a micritic originally carbonate mud matrix Lima and De Ros 2019 Carramal et al 2022 Another important question refers to the importance of discriminating rocks made by abundant coalesced spherulites and or shrubs from those with non-coalesced spherulites and or shrubs within an abundant Mgclays matrix or their replacement products Azer do et al 2021 proposed a facies classification scheme similar to that of Wright and Barnett 2017 2020 with the same terminological problems and operational complexity The classification system proposed by Gomes et al 2020 properly considered the relative contribution of depositional and early diagenetic components sediment mineralogy and dissolution for an insight into depositional conditions and reservoir quality of the pre-salt rocks Their classification for in situ deposits correctly ascribes their formation to three basic syngenetic and early diagenetic constituents mud matrix mostly Mg-clays calcite spherulites and fascicular shrubs Fig 6 It contains however some definition problems and a certain bias towards representing essentially the reservoir types ignoring that the syngenetic or diagenetic constituents that constitute the in situ sag deposits occur in all proportions and mixing patterns The common occurrence of shrubs within mud matrix for instance is ignored Besides they failed to recognize that the mudstones evolved from heterogeneous diagenetic replacement of laminated Mg-clays by calcite dolomite or silica FIG 6 Diagram proposed by Gomes et al 2020 for the classification of the in situ deposits of the Barra Velha Formation pre-salt section of Santos Basin Comments in the text

common in the Aptian pre-salt section As noted before the Dunham 1962 and Embry and Klovan 1971 classification system presents some serious conceptual problems and their application even by experienced carbonate petrologists is problematic and contradictory see e g Lokier and Al Junaibi 2016 and the use of terms such as packstone or wackestone is inadequate for pre-salt rocks in which the matrix is made of Mg-clays Additionally they propose a compositional classification diagram for these rocks with the matrix at one vertex and intraclasts of spherulites and shrubs at the other two Fig 7 which is potentially confusing owing to the mixing of textural and compositional attributes 699 Recently Borghi et al 2022 presented another classification system for the sag pre-salt carbonates of Santos Basin Fig 8 Their system incorporates some features of the Gomes et al 2020 classification but avoiding the problematic use of Embry and Klovan 1971 names such as packstone wackestone or floatstone for the redeposited rocks Their definitions for those rocks are however somewhat confusing as they affirm that Calcirudites and calcarenites are composed of intra- or extra-clasts mostly of limestone and dolostone subordinately chert silica but also including minor silicate minerals grains These may be considered terrigenous clastics Deposits consisting of extrabasinal fragments of preexisting carbonate rocks should be instead classified as terrigenous lithic carbonatoclastic rocks calclitites sensu Folk 1968 They also created the term crustone for crust-like rocks Fig 8 which confusingly can present quite different compositions and textures from fibrous to prismatic to massive micro- to cryptocrystalline and or micropeloidal and brushed patterns with vertical moldic pores with calcite incrustations It is unclear in their scheme what is the difference between rocks essentially made by fascicular shrubs shrubstones and crustones made by the same shrubs Another somewhat odd feature of their system is naming of rocks made by similar amounts of shrubs spherulites and crusts as tupilite from the Tupi Field the largest in Santos Basin Another problematic aspect of the Borghi et al 2022 classification refers to the concept that some pre-salt rocks can have been formed simultaneously by in situ and redepositional processes termed e g as calcarenitic crustone or crustose spherulitic calcarenite Fig 8 Although the intercalation of in situ and intraclastic deposits is quite common in the presalt succession each rock type should be classified separately for the sake of petrologic and sedimentologic clarity Considering the problems and limitations of the existing classification systems of the unusual pre-salt rocks a new classification system is proposed for the in situ and the resedimented deposits of the Aptian section of the pre-salt sag section of the South Atlantic basins A NEW OPERATIONAL CLASSIFICATION FOR APTIAN PRE-SALT DEPOSITS The

to the original proportion among the three main components reconstructed considering their alteration products and dissolution For the purpose of compositional reconstruction the recognition of the remnants of the depositional matrix and the framework components and of the inheritance of the primary fabric in the alteration products is seminal This is a key factor for the description of the

classification scheme the volumetric estimation is conducted solely considering the mineral mass and then the related values should be normalized to 100 As already discussed all systems previously proposed for the classification of reworked rocks of the pre-salt sag interval Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2017 2020 Gomes et al 2020 present severe problems and limitations The major problem of those proposals is acquired from the use of names created by Dunham 1962 and Embry and Klovan 1971 for conventional marine carbonate deposits containing carbonate depositional matrix such as wackestone packstone and floatstone for pre-salt sag rocks devoid of carbonate mud and which mud matrix is originally constituted by Mg-clays We also discuss the lack of conceptual consistence of the Embry and Klovan 1971 system as only little more than 10 of allochems larger than 2 mm are not enough to support the fabric of a rudstone and floatstones with mud and sand carbonate matrix would present quite different depositional energy and reservoir-quality significance The best option for a consistent textural classification system for the resedimented sag deposits is represented by a purely textural system with depositional and reservoir-quality coherence Our proposal combines classes defined based on a modified version of the Folk 1968 textural classification for clastic deposits with names adapted from the Grabau 1904 and the Bramkamp and Powers 1958 classifications Fig 10 The 30 limit of the rudaceous rocks is coherent with the support of the fabric by the 2 mm particles and the distinction between muddy and arenaceous calcirudites allows for the important differentiation between types with low and high energy and reservoir quality Additionally a complementary term can be used to make explicit the fabric support of rudaceous rocks as e g mud-supported or grain-supported Generic textural names arenite rudite lutite can be applied to the classification of rocks made by different grain compositions and mixtures of carbonate clay siliciclastic phosphate and other types of grains Fig 11 A high-hierarchy compositional classification based on the Zuffa 1980 classification of hybrid arenites is proposed for the pre-salt sag resedimented deposits as of other mixed or hybrid particulate rocks Fig 12 Such organization allows a continuous textural classification between pure compositional end-members e g siliciclastic volcanoclastic and carbonate rocks and the correspondent two-component hybrid rock that is not constrained by criteria exclusive to one of the compositional classes The resedimented hybrid pre-salt rocks usually consist of a combination of three components which constitute the vertices of a high-hierarchy classification triangle intrabasinal Mg-clays intrabasinal carbonate and siliciclastic volcaniclastic grains Fig 12 Intrabasinal Mg-clays particles correspond to ooids peloids and intraclasts Carramal et al 2022 Intrabasinal carbonate particles are essentially represented by intraclasts of fascicular and spherulitic calcite aggregates Gomes et al 2020 Carvalho et al 2022 The siliciclastic volcaniclastic component is usually represented by volcanic rock fragments and by clasts of plutonic origin such as granitic gneissic fragments and associated monocrystalline quartz and feldspar grains Vieira de Luca et al 2017 Carvalho et al 2022 The term volcaniclastic applied here is a generic one and is conceptualized and discussed by Fisher 1961 1966 It is important to consider that in this scheme volcanic clasts from intrabasinal and extrabasinal origins are not differentiated Thus for detailed provenance studies another classification triangle would be required for the genetic distinction between different volcanic fragments A similar adjustment would be required where lithoclasts from the bioclastic calcarenites and calcirudites coquinas of the rift section Carbonate Extrabasinal in Zuffa s 1985 scheme are relevant as locally observed in the Mero Field Rocha et al 2021 To avoid conceptual problems derived from the various textural definitions and grain-size boundaries for the mud fraction e g Dunham 1962 Embry and Klovan 1971 Folk 1968 we suggest adopting the 62 mm limit used by Folk 1968 A grain-size approach similar to that used for the 703 sandstones can be applied to refine the texture of the lutites as coarse medium and fine as proposed by Lazar et al 2015 In their scheme a coarse mudstone has more than two-thirds of the mud-size grains as coarse mud coarse silt 32 mm a fine mudstone has more than twothirds of the mud-size grains as fine mud clay and fine silt 8 mm whereas a medium mudstone has neither coarse nor fine mud as more than two-thirds of the mud-size grains As discussed for the coarser-grained rocks the standardization of the textural definitions for the lutites enables a continuous rock textural classification between different compositional classes and hybrid types Additionally the detailed size distinction in the mudsize range acknowledges the different hydrodynamic behavior and dispersal mechanisms of coarse silt-size fraction compared to the clay-size fraction Lazar et al 2015 and at the same time incorporates the operational limitation on optical recognition of the fine-mud fraction The textural names are to be complemented with information regarding the main compositional constituents e g intraclasts ooids etc primary structural characteristics e g stratified laminated massive etc and main alterations and modifications partially or extensively dolomitized silicified recrystallized dissolved fractured etc Rocks strongly altered by diagenetic and hydrothermal processes in which original texture and composition are no longer recognizable can be called by the classical names sparite or microsparite if recrystallized dolosparite or dolostone or microdolosparite if dolomitized and chert if silicified Examples of application of the proposed system can be seen in Figures 13 and 14 It can be perceived that this system offers a more coherent and consistent correspondence with the characteristic pre-salt rock types and with their reservoir-quality aspects With the proposal of a coherent simple and operational classification system for the unusual yet extremely important South Atlantic Aptian pre-salt reservoirs and associated rocks we hope to contribute to the understanding exploration and production of this extraordinary petroleum province

Geologische Vereinigung e V GV 2020 Abstract Lacustrine carbonate deposits mark the rift-sag sedimentation stage of the so-called pre-salt section of the Campos and Santos Basins in the Southeast Brazilian continental shelf These salt-sealed carbonate reservoirs form deep-water giant and prolific oil fields that are currently responsible for approximately 70 of the Brazilian oil and gas production In the Santos Basin the sag stage carbonates are represented by the Aptian Barra Velha Formation characterized by exotic textural and compositional features whose origin development and correlation with petrophysical properties have been broadly discussed in the last decade A geological and petrophysical study has been performed based on core samples plugs and thin-sections of a well in the Barra Velha Formation from the eastern Santos Basin The analyzed core interval was grouped into six depositional facies constituted by the association of five key textural components 1 crystal shrubs 2 calcite spherulites 3 hybrid forms 4 mud-grade carbonates and dolomite and 5 intraclasts The relationship between the depositional framework and the poroperm system as evidenced by petrographic image analysis and CT-scan data is highly complex The depositional control over porosity is erratic mainly due to the extensive diagenetic and possible hydrothermal overprint Dolomite cementation dolomitization pervasive silicification and dissolution processes are the main primary porosity modifiers Petrophysical analysis indicates that intraclastic and spherulitic grainstones rudstones affected by matrix dissolution may present the best reservoir properties in certain intervals even surpassing the shrubby framestones which are widely regarded as the best reservoir facies

al 2017 The variety of depositional processes the diverse nature of the carbonates added to the high chemical reactivity of the carbonate minerals and their tendency toward a complex diagenetic history can generate very heterogeneous poroperm systems Rezende and Pope 2015 quantitatively related depositional texture characteristics such as size sorting and packing to the porosity and permeability of the microbialites from the Santos Basin corroborating the importance of the depositional process on primary porosity On the other hand Herlinger et al 2017 characterized the complex diagenetic pathways of the pre-salt carbonates from the Campos Basin and their impact on permeability and porosity indicating that diagenesis is capable of changing potential primary reservoirs into poor quality reservoirs or non-reservoirs 13 In this context the purpose of this study is to present new data and interpretations on the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs of the Aptian Barra Velha Formation from the Santos Basin offshore Brazil To do so an integrated stratigraphic sedimentological and petrophysical study of a target core interval was carried out seeking to understand how the depositional framework evolved and how the post-depositional process affected the poroperm systems This work presents qualitative and quantitative analysis regarding the main presalt sag phase facies that are common in many oilfields in the South Atlantic Basins and our intention is for this work to contribute to general knowledge on lacustrine carbonate reservoirs Geological setting The Santos Basin is a passive-margin basin located in the southeastern part of the Brazilian continental margin covering a total area of c 350 000 km2 between the states of Rio de Janeiro and Santa Catarina It is bounded in the NE by the Cabo Frio High and in the SW by the Florianopolis Platform defining its borders with the Campos and Pelotas Basins respectively Fig 1 Moreira et al 2007 The basin was formed under an extensional tectonic regime during the rupture of the Gondwana supercontinent in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous which led to the separation of South America and Africa and the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean Chang et al 1992 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Mohriak et al 2008 The break-up of western Gondwana took nearly 40 million years from the early Valanginian to the late Albian Szatmari 2000 The basin-fill history of the Santos Basin can be subdivided into three megasequences 1 rift -138 123 My 2 post-rift sag -123 113 My and 3 drift -113 0 My Moreira et al 2007 Fig 2

Quirk et al 2013 The Ariri Formation evaporites were deposited in a paleogeographic scenario similar to a gulf with highly saline waters and negative hydrological balance Chang et al 1992 The evaporite interval has a highly variable thickness due to halokinesis but may be as thick as 2 km and it is composed of a lower layer of anhydrite overlain by halite and other salt minerals creating a regional seal Moreira et al 2007 Beasley et al 2010 Exploration targets in the strata above the evaporites are commonly referred to as post-salt or suprasalt prospects and the ones below are called

grainstones rudstones 3 spherulitic packstones grainstones and hybrid forms 4 laminated dolomudstones 5 shrubby framestones and hybrid forms and 6 spherulitic grainstones intercalated with shrubby framestones Each facies is formed by different associations of five key textural components 1 crystal shrubs 2 calcite spherulites 3 hybrid forms 4 mudgrade carbonates and dolomite and 5 intraclasts Facies dominated by crystal shrubs spherulites and hybrid forms F1 F3 F5 and F6 are the most recurrent comprising about 80 of the entire interval These facies are generally characterized by autochthonous deposits with subordinated occurrences of transported sediments Facies dominated by reworked grains mainly intraclasts F2 correspond to approximately 15 of the total and dolomudstones with minor clay content add up to 5 of the total The identified depositional facies are described below This study is based on c 8 m of core samples 30 petrographic thin sections and 11 plugs of a vertical well herein named SB-A1 comprising the Barra Velha Formation from the Santos Basin Restrictions placed by one partner company preclude the disclosure of depths well names and oil fields The applied methods include optical petrography plane-polarized light PL crossed-polarized light XPL petrographic image analysis X-ray computed tomography CT-scan nuclear magnetic resonance NMR and conventional poroperm gas tests The petrographic image analysis was performed on thin section high-definition images obtained from a transmitted light scanner with 6400 dpi resolution The analyzed thin sections were stained with an acid solution of alizarin red for calcite dolomite differentiation and impregnated with blue epoxy resin to improve the porous space characterization The scan images were binarized which enabled the separation of the porous blue epoxy resin and non-porous space matrix grains and cement through RGB curves The binarization and segmentation process was performed with the PerGeos software v 1 5 CT-scan data acquisition of core samples was performed on a Siemens industrial tomography device model SWFVD30C RES 100 m at the Center for Petroleum Studies of the University of Campinas CEPETRO UNICAMP In addition high-resolution CT images from plugs were acquired in a ZEISS XRadia Versa XRM-500 Scanner 13 Results Sag depositional facies Shrubby framestones F1 The shrubby framestones facies occur in beds with an average thickness of c 0 9 m consisting of millimeter-tocentimeter thick layers of in situ crystal shrub crusts with secondary concentrations of spherulites intraclasts and phosphatic bioclasts The shrub-like growths are the main textural components of this facies and they are characterized by non-magnesian fibrous-radial calcite crystals with

patterns Fig 4a e These calcite shrubs are morphologically similar to the crystal shrubs Chafetz and Guidry 1999 defined as shrub-like forms that morphologically display a strong influence of crystal habit The crystal shrubs coalesce both vertically and horizontally creating crusts with interstitial space variably affected by cementation The crystal shrubs vary significantly in terms of size packing and morphology Individual shrubs range in size from 1 to 20 mm but bigger dendritic structures consisting of several coalesced shrubs may reach 5 cm The length width L W ratio is usually between 1 and 2 and the dominant macro- and micromorphologies Claes et al 2017 are arborescent-to-dendriform and fan-to-dendritic respectively Fig 4c d Shrubs with more prominent horizontal development L W ratios lower than 1 are rare In general well-developed shrubs present high L W ratios complex branching patterns and dendriform morphology creating complex fabrics with the potential for high primary porosity Packing may vary from shrubs spaced c 5 mm apart to high density crusts with small interstitial porosity and sutured contacts 13 International Journal of Earth Sciences 13

The most common porosity occurs as growth framework pores among crystal shrubs and their branches Fig 4e Intraparticle intra-shrub porosity created by calcite dissolution occurs as micropores irregularly disseminate through the shrub or can be oriented by internal structures following growth bands and radial crystals Fig 4e Finally irregular microfractures may also occur although they are not as common as the other types of porosity Fig 4e In most cases c 75 of the thin sections the primary growth framework porosity is partially filled by dolomite and silica cement Fig 4b d f the main diagenetic constituents of these deposits Dolomite occurs as rhombohedral crystals with variable intercrystalline porosity or as isopachous crystals around the calcite fabric Dolomitic cement varies in abundance from nearly absent to pore-obliterating mosaics Silica occurs as prismatic coarse quartz microporous microcrystalline quartz and fibrous chalcedony different silica varieties may occur concomitantly in the same pore space Pervasive silicification and dolomitization partially replace the calcite fabric in certain restricted intervals that are usually associated to low porosity Intraclastic grainstones and rudstones F2 Intraclastic grainstones rudstones occur in a single 1 10 m thick interval and are characterized by calcitic detrital grains Fig 5 commonly interlayered with thin levels of crystal shrub crusts This facies is generally grain-supported c 85 of the thin sections and composed of coarse sand to pebble-grade reworked fragments of crystal shrub crusts spherulites dolomudstones silicified particles phosphatic bioclasts and pisoids The fabric is characterized by poor size sorting tight packing and significant grain shape diversity ranging from spherical and well-rounded to irregular and very angular grains Fig 5a e In general coarser intraclasts present preserved internal structure such as radial and fascicular crystal habit of spherulites and shrubs which are usually unclear in the fine-grained sediments Some spherical-to-elliptical grains also present well-defined concentric internal laminations and resemble pisoids Fig 5b c Phosphatic bioclasts Fig 5f are also common and occur in small amounts usually less than 3 fragments per thin section These fragments consist of apatite and occur as elongate fragments up to 10 mm or as irregular particles resembling skeletal elements Most of the bioclastic fragments were affected by micritization and fracturing due to compaction The primary depositional texture of F2 facies was mainly affected by silicification and dolomite cementation that obstructed most of the primary interparticle porosity in the majority of the analyzed thin sections both processes seem to be more intense in this facies than in the shrubby framestones In addition the intraclasts were strongly affected by internal dissolution and developed high intraparticle porosity One thin-section shows evidence of strong matrix dissolution resulting in extreme porosity Fig 5e corresponding to a restricted 3 cm porous layer in the core Open fractures occur in low spatial density Spherulitic packstones grainstones and hybrid forms F3 Spherulitic packstones and grainstones facies occur in beds 30 80 cm thick consisting of millimeter-to-centimeter thick layers of spherulites intercalated or in gradational pattern to transitional grain types between shrubs and spherulites here called hybrid forms Fig 6 Carbonate spherulites are defined as spherical-to-elliptical grains composed of a radiating array of either calcite or aragonite crystals Chafetz et al 2018 The calcite spherulites present a diameter ranging from 0 1 to 2 mm and are easily recognized under crossed-polarized light by the dark cross-shaped radial figure Fig 6d h It is common for spherulites to present small micritic or microsparitic nuclei which are frequently dissolved leaving a moldic void Fig 6h Some spherulites show evidence of transport and reworking such as fragmentation and fracturing whereas others seem to have grown in situ with good morphology preservation and good size sorting The hybrid forms were previously described by Saller et al 2016 as transitional grains between spherulites and crystal shrubs These hybrid grains have characteristics of both shrubs and spherulites featuring spherical bases associated to asymmetric cross-shaped figures under crossedpolarized light and are elongate perpendicular to the bedding with variable branching levels Fig 6e f The hybrid forms range from asymmetric spherulites to well-developed and branched structures up to 4 mm in length The spherulites and hybrid forms occur as grainstones and packstones with interparticle porosity variably affected by cementation and dissolution Similar to the previously described facies dolomite and silica are the main types of cement Fig 6c f pervasive dolomitization is relatively common and may destroy the spherulites original morphology and obliterate primary porosity Fig 6g In addition burial compaction reduced the interparticle porosity and 13 International Journal of Earth Sciences Fig 5

generally follow the radially disposed calcite crystals Fig 6h although this is not as frequent as that observed in intraclastic grains Laminated dolomudstones F4 13 The laminated dolomudstones facies occurs as thin beds 30 cm characterized by very fine texture and irregular submillimeter-to-millimeter thick laminations Fig 7 The International Journal of Earth Sciences fabric consists of mud-grade carbonate debris with occasional calcite particles up to 0 5 mm in size blocky dolomite crystals usually smaller than 0 1 mm in size and common phosphatic bioclasts Silicification is the most striking feature of this facies and occurs in the form of abundant silica layers and nodules Fig 7a b d which may be as extensive as the core diameter Silica occurs mainly as microcrystalline quartz or chalcedony and may present high microporosity The porous system of these dolomudstones is characterized by small intercrystalline and interparticle porosity possibly enhanced by dissolution Fig 7c Fracture porosity is also commonly associated with this facies as a significant amount of irregular and continuous fractures with apertures varying from 0 1 to 0 5 mm occur Some of those fractures are partially or completely filled by silica and opaque heavy minerals Shrubby framestones and hybrid forms F5 The shrubby framestones and hybrid form facies occur in a single interval c 70 cm thick and it is characterized by centimeter thick layers of crystal shrubs and well-developed hybrid forms with subordinated spherulite occurrences This facies differs from facies 1 and 3 by the abundance and development level of the hybrid forms greater L W ratio and branching degree possibly constituting an intermediate occurrence between these two facies The diagenetic modifications are similar to facies 1 and 3 dolomite and silica cementation partially fill the primary growth framework pore space Spherulitic grainstones intercalated with shrubby framestones F6 High frequency intercalation of millimeter-to-centimeter thick layers of spherulitic grainstones and shrubby framestones occur in a single interval c 95 cm thick The occurrences of crystal shrubs and spherulites in this facies repeat the same textural features of previous occurrences F1 and F3 with well-developed dendritic shrubs and spherical in situ spherulites Dolomitic and silica cementation and dissolution processes vary in amount from layer-to-layer affecting primary growth framework and interparticle porosity Petrophysics Petrographic image analysis Petrographic image analysis was applied to 30 petrographic thin sections in order to estimate porosity and to provide initial data on pore type and pore size distribution Table 1 presents the average porosity and the main pore types for the different textural components and diagenetic conditions The overall porosity ranges between 0 05 and 42 8 average 6 54 standard deviation 2 86 Samples dominated by crystal shrub crusts hybrid forms and calcite spherulites with preserved or enhanced growth framework and interparticle pores respectively present the highest porosities 5 20 Thin sections showing crystal shrubs hybrid forms and spherulites strongly affected by cementation and mud-size carbonate present the lowest porosity 5 Samples of intraclastic composition in general present intermediate porosity values 1 10 with the exception of an anomalous sample of 42 8 porosity associated to an extreme dissolution process Fig 5e Four common relationships between the main fabrics of the studied interval and different pore systems are illustrated in Fig 8 Shrubby framestones samples with high growth framework porosity and spherulitic grainstones with enhanced interparticle pores present the highest pore area range with pores larger than 1 mm2 As displayed in Fig 8a b by crystal shrub and spherulite samples pores larger than 0 01 mm2 represent less than 1 10 of the total number of pores but correspond to 63 and 80 9 of the total porosity respectively The majority of the intraclastic grainstones rudstones samples presented intense cementation by dolomite and silica and although they may also present millimeter-scale pores tend to be dominated by small area intraparticle pores As can be observed from the sample shown in Fig 8c porosity is mainly limited within the intraclastic grains and the pore area analysis indicates that pores smaller than 0 01 mm2 add most of the porosity 63 3 Mud-grade carbonates and dolomite samples associated to dolomudstone facies presented low porosity dominated by very small area interparticle and intercrystalline pores in the sample presented in Fig 8d pore areas smaller than 0 01 mm2 correspond to 78 8 of the total porosity Core samples CT scan A representative 1 3 m core subinterval featuring the main facies and textural components of the studied interval was chosen for a continuous CT-scan data acquisition Fig 9 The CT-scan data enabled us not only to segment and calculate porosity but also to improve the sedimentological characterization However due to the resolution of the CT-scan device the pore size recognition was limited to pores larger than 100 m certainly underestimating the total porosity As shown by petrographic image analysis pore systems of intervals dominated by intraparticle intercrystalline and small interparticle growth framework pores were probably not detected by the CT-scan data acquisition The detected macroporosity ranges between almost null to c 8 and its vertical profile is characterized by high porosity peaks that are a few centimeters thick intercalated 13 International Journal of Earth Sciences 13 International Journal of Earth Sciences Fig 6 Aspects of the spherulitic packstones grainstones and hybrid form facies a

follows radial calcite crystals green arrow and dissolved nucleus red arrow XPL with low porosity zones Although the porosity peaks are mainly associated with the specific lithological-related porous systems such as the shrubby framestones dominated by high growth framework porosity and intraclastic rudstones characterized by interparticle porosity the porosity profile poorly corresponds to the lithological variations This behavior is expected to be related to intervals particularly affected by dolomite and silica cementation Due to differences in mass density and atomic number of the composed silica and carbonate minerals they present different X-ray attenuation coefficients For most of the X-ray energy spectrum quartz is substantially less attenuating than calcite resulting in darker gray values in the tomography image Vlassenbroeck et al 2007 Saur et al 2020 Centimeter-size irregular and pervasive silica layers and nodules can be recognized throughout the entire interval and are associated to null or low macroporosity zones In addition the CT-data enabled the clear identification of high-density heavy minerals highly attenuating which appear as bright spots in the tomography image The occurrence of heavy minerals is mainly associated to dolomudstones F4 and intraclastic grainstone rudstones F2 and as crystals filling fractures along with silica or associated to silicified layers High resolution CT scan and NMR High-resolution CT-scan NMR and conventional gas tests were applied to eleven 40 mm-diameter plugs that represent the main depositional facies and textural components of the studied interval The results are listed in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig 10 Gas tests and NMR porosity measurements are close and as expected highlight the high heterogeneity of the reservoir the porosity values range from 2 69 to 26 32 and 2 36 to 21 21 respectively The highest poroperm values are associated with samples dominated by crystal shrubs Bp2 Bp4 Bp11 and calcite spherulites affected by matrix dissolution Bp5 The porosity estimated by high-resolution CT-scan data segmentation diverges in relation to gas injection and NMR results with values 55 5 99 6 lower ranging from 0 01 to 11 7 Even with a higher resolution 40 m than the conventional CT-scan 100 m applied to core samples the CT-scan of plugs was still unable to detect a significant amount of the pore volume As evidenced by the irreducible water saturation analysis SWI samples such as Bp1 Bp6 Bp7 and Bp9 are dominated by microporosity generally 4 m which is far below the tomography resolution resulting in segmented porosity values close to zero In addition all samples except Bp11 and Bp5 presented zero pore connectivity in the CT data Although porosity recognition was partial CT-scan data revealed important information on fabric characteristics and macroporosity distribution Fig 11 Pore volume distribution followed similar patterns for crystal shrubs and reworked spherulites Fig 11a c as observed in the petrographic image analysis Fig 8a b with larger pores 0 01 mm3 dominating total porosity The total porosity of samples constituted of intraclasts also appears to be dominated by large volume pores Fig 11e however small intraparticle pores commonly associated with this lithology Fig 8c were not detected by CT-scan segmentation and the darker grey shades lower density of these grains indicates the presence of abundant internal porosity Although sample Bp10 presents moderately high porosity gas 17 48 NMR 12 46 the sample is characterized by low permeability k 0 0093 mD which is possibly associated with the cementation process that isolated interparticle pores between intraclasts Textural components and even diagenetic features were significantly better defined in high-resolution CT-scan The absence of porosity observed in core CT-scan of facies F3 Fig 9 was also registered in the high-resolution CT-scan of sample Bp9 Fig 11d The plug sample was affected by pervasive silicification dark grey in tomography image that almost obliterated interparticle pores and possibly replaced the matrix resulting in spherulites and hybrid forms floating in silica cement In this sample the detected porosity 0 01 is mostly made up of isolated small intraparticle pores In contrast sample Bp5 also constituted of spherulites but rather reworked and associated with intense matrix dissolution presented the highest poroperm values gas 26 32 NMR 21 21 k 1436 33 mD This sample is characterized by unobstructed and highly connected interparticle pores similar to those observed in poorly cemented oolitic grainstones In this sample 90 of the segmented porosity is connected in both vertical and horizontal directions Another interesting aspect that high-resolution CT-scan revealed is the effect of high frequency intercalation of porous shrub layers and fine detrital grains and dolomite 13 International Journal of Earth

the sag interval is discussed below possibly associated with microbial activity another argument is that the shrubs present vertical growth and the ability to create depositional highs similar to modern coral and algal reefs Ceraldi and Green 2016 also interpret that the upright-to-inclined growth patterns of the shrubs from the Kwanza and Campos Basins suggest a response to sun light or current energy In contrast Wright and Barnett 2015 and Herlinger et al 2017 while not excluding the microbial activity defend the predominance of abiotic chemical precipitation processes Wright and Barnett 2015 argue that the evidence of microbial activity is rare and inconclusive in the Santos Basin and as highlighted by Herlinger et al 2017 for the Campos Basin the continuous fibrous Origin of the shrubby framestones Among the South-Atlantic pre-salt sag-phase facies perhaps the most striking and controversial are the shrub-dominated lithologies These unusual shrub-like autochthonous carbonate features have been a source of major scientific debate mainly focused on their formation and bioticity Saller et al 2016 argue that the shrubs from the pre-salt section of the Kwanza Basin have a microbial origin as micritization and erosion embayments were identified in the shrubs and are 13 International Journal of Earth Sciences Table 2 Summary of the petrophysical analysis of the

highresolution computed tomography segmentation The three porosity measurement methods indicate that a wide variation of porosity may occur for samples constituted of the same textural components this behavior is an effect of post-depositional changes The uniformly lower porosity values inferred from micro CT analysis are a result of the resolution limit of the method crystal fabric is a strong argument in favor of abiotic mineral precipitation The shrub-like precipitates analyzed in this work show no clear textural evidence of microbial activity Textures related to typical microbialites

study and the complexity of this subject which demands further investigation of such fabrics As pointed out by Bastianini et al 2019 the absence of microbial texture does not directly imply that there is no microbial influence on precipitation as the simple presence of polar 13 International Journal of Earth Sciences 13 International Journal of Earth Sciences Fig 11 High-resolution CT-scan 3D

enhance dendrite growth Conversely biota present during crystal growth does not necessarily imply that it affects crystal growth Folk et al 1985 Pentecost and Coletta 2007 Rainey and Jones 2009 The carbonate shrubs analyzed in this work were classified as crystal shrubs Chafetz and Guidry 1999 dominated by abiotic mineral precipitation mainly due to the distinct crystal habits and regular repeating morphologies contrasting with what would be expected for complete bacterial shrubs which tend to exhibit irregular morphologies composed of micritic aggregates related to the bacterial clumps Fig 12 Typical examples of bacterial shrubs from analogous travertine systems can be found in Chafetz and Guidry 1999 Claes et al 2017 and Erthal et al 2017 Shrubby fabrics in pre-salt deposits are widely regarded as being formed in very saline-to-alkaline environments but interpretations and models differ in relation to the dominant control factors on the distribution of facies between oscillations in bathymetry accommodation space and environmental energy Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2016 geochemistry and evaporation-refilling cycles Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Tosca 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2016 and hydrogeochemistry focusing on the type of water sourcing the lake and the leakage to aquifers MercedesMart n et al 2019 Here we interpreted the shrub-dominated facies F1 and F5 to be formed during lowstand shallow and highly saturated waters associated to a moderate-to-high energy environment Fig 13b Several studies on calcite shrub morphology indicate that hydrodynamic conditions and flow energy play an important role on shrub morphology development Pentecost and Viles 1994 Rainey and Jones 2009 Okumura et al 2012 Erthal et al 2017 According to studies performed by Erthal et al 2017 on shrubby-abundant travertines the increase of the flow rates enhances precipitation rates decreases microbial influence and develop denser and more complex morphologies In addition the stratigraphic proximity and sometimes interlayering between crystal shrubs and coarse intraclastic grains reinforces the idea of energetic shallow conditions Formation of calcite spherulites According to Saller et al 2016 in the sag section of the Kwanza Basin there is no clear separation between the precipitation of depositional carbonates and the early diagenetic features These circumstances seem to be recurrent in many pre-salt formations Herlinger et al 2017 found petrographic evidence that calcite spherulites from the Campos Basin are an eogenetic constituent replacing and displacing the original unconsolidated sediment or gel Whereas Saller et al 2016 consider spherulites as well as shrubs to be depositional precipitates The Barra Velha Formation spherulites have been interpreted to form and nucleate inside unconsolidated muddy sediments or gels in a hyper-alkaline environment Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 According to Wright and Barnett 2015 when there was a rapid deposition of a Mg silicate gel talc-stevensite precursor the substrate was unsuitable for shrub growth and favored the nucleation of spherulites inside the gel In addition the formation of insitu spherulites would probably require water that was deep enough to have limited current agitation Saller et al 2016 According to the model proposed by Chafetz et al 2018 for the Brazilian pre-salt spherulites these allochems formed around fine-grained micritic nuclei possibly microbialrelated in the water column Fig 13d The micritic core is then enveloped by calcite seed crystals by microbialinduced precipitation and settles at the bottom of the lake The presence of the seed crystal facilitates the growth of abiotic cortices in the sediment water interface This model justifies the presence of the nucleus in most spherulites in the studied interval and the well-developed crystal habits of the spherulite cortices Formation of hybrid forms Facies 3 and 5 present morphologically intermediate forms between spherulites and crystal shrubs According to Saller et al 2016 the morphology of the calcite precipitate is a function of depositional energy degree of supersaturation and substrate Therefore the hybrid forms may be formed in transitional environments time and space between those required for the formation of spherulites and shrubs Fig 13c Asymmetrical spherulite growth was probably facilitated by the proximity to the sediment water interface associated with moderate-to-low Mg silicate precipitation rates in a more energetic environment than the one associated to spherulite nucleation These settings allowed the spherulites to grow into the water column and develop dendritic morphological patterns Genesis of the detrital facies Intraclastic grainstones and rudstones in the sag phase of the Campos and Kwanza Basins have been interpreted as being formed in shallow and high energy environments Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi

spectrum between microbial induced controlled precipitation and abiotic mineral precipitation and shrub types according to Chafetz and Guidry 1999 The Barra Velha Formation shrubs were interpreted to be somewhere within the crystal shrubs domain formed by fibrous calcite crystals flows that were capable of transporting grains even larger than 1 cm across Fig 13a The poor size- and morphology sorting including the presence of very angular grains also indicates non-selective short transportation Another possibility is that these abundant reworked sediments were related to local tectonism and small-scale syn-depositional faulting that could indicate the presence of fan-delta facies Wright and Rodriguez 2018 These settings could promote exposure and extensive erosion of older deposits and the deposition of coarse intraclastic grainstones rudstones deposits In contrast the laminated dolomudstones facies are the finest products of reworking and are probably associated with deeper and low energy environments Fig 13e The presence of pre-compaction silica nodules and phosphatic bioclasts can be interpreted as evidence for a drop in pH 13 International Journal of Earth Sciences Fig 13

Sciences triggered by the lake water freshening Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Dolomite and silicification Herlinger et al 2017 considers five main patterns for dolomite precipitation in the sag section of the Campos Basin 1 early dolomite that grew inside the unconsolidated sediment 2 mimetic replacement of stevensite lamination 3 pore filling cement 4 pervasive replacement of the rock and 5 saddle dolomite associated to fracturing Saller et al 2016 also identified patterns 3 and 4 in the sag section of the Kwanza Basin and suggested the occurrence of primary crystalline dolomite precipitated directly from the lake water In the studied interval the main occurrence of dolomite is as pore-filling cement partially or totally obliterating the primary porosity and or dissolution-related pores In addition dolomite also occurs as a partial replacement of the calcitic fabric dolomitization which is mainly associated to thin and highly cemented intervals Dolomite bridges as those identified by Wright and Barnett 2015 2017 as the mimetic replacement of clay matrices such as stevensite are rare and uncertain in the analyzed interval as well as the occurrence of stevensite itself Although stevensite is an abundant constituent of the pre-salt deposits in the studied interval its virtual absence may be related to the small sample size and to intense diagenetic overprint Apart from dolomite silica is a major diagenetic constituent and creator of reservoir heterogeneity As previously stated displacive silica nodules and thin concordant silica layers associated to facies F4 probably have a depositional-to-early diagenetic origin associated to a drop in pH However irregular and pervasive silicification and silica-filled fractures associated to heavy minerals points to a late and possible polyphase origin Hydrothermal circulation of deep-sourced fluids has been proposed in the Brazilian pre-salt settings Herlinger et al 2017 to be linked with processes such as dissolution intense fracturing silicification dolomitization and crystallization of barite fluorite pyrite and other sulfides Vieira de Luca et al 2017 and Tritlla et al 2019 identified late hightemperature hydrothermal silicification in the Campos Basin including features such as quartz veins stockworks and hydrothermal breccias Facies succession and cyclicity Wide variations on spatial and temporal distributions of facies occur in the South Atlantic lacustrine carbonates and different facies may occur according to the well position 13 relative to paleobathymetric trends Ceraldi and Green 2016 However similar facies succession patterns have been noted such as the cyclothem proposed by Wright and Barnett 2015 Fig 3 and the shallowing upwards sequence identified by Ceraldi and Green 2016 Figure 13 compiles elements from several studies on the pre-salt carbonates showing a schematic evolution model for the observed facies and its relationship to the main environmental factors proposed to control the succession of facies A hypothesized sequence begins with deep low energy fresher water laminated dolomudstones F4 followed by alkaline low energy spherulitic wackestones grading to grainstones F3 and F4 progressing to shallow water hybrid forms and shrub-dominated framestones F5 and F1 and finally intraclastic grainstones and rudstones F2 F1 and F2 appear to be easily interchangeable due to shallow reworking Detrital intraclastic facies may also occur in different moments of the cycle depending on high energy events or tectonically-induced transformations on local base level Petrophysical properties and reservoir control The shrub-dominated facies were considered the best sag phase reservoirs in the Campos Herlinger et al 2017 Santos Wright and Tosca 2016 and Kwanza Saller et al 2016 Basins This is due to high growth framework porosity and fair permeability added to the relative abundance of these facies in many pre-salt fields However for the sag phase deposits the link between depositional facies and reservoir quality must be considered with caution A wide range of poroperm values was identified by Herlinger et al 2017 for similar shrub-dominated facies coalescent crust from the sag phase of the Campos Basin gas 0 2 16 1 k 0 001 295 000 mD Similar petrophysical heterogeneity was identified for shrub-dominated samples from the Barra Velha Formation gas 0 74 17 44 k 0 001 25 00 mD in this study These wide variations show that the reservoir potential for shrub-dominated facies may be attenuated or obliterated by post-depositional processes Silica and dolomite cementation may modify large millimeter-scale growth-framework pores into numerous micropores that have little influence in permeability Herlinger et al 2017 through MICP analysis obtained an average microporosity of 37 50 and 50 94 for coalesced and non-coalesced calcite crusts respectively The Swi analysis performed for shrub-dominated samples resulted in similar results with an average of 49 7 micropores A similar degree of petrophysical heterogeneity occurs associated to spherulite and intraclast-dominated facies with a wide range of reservoir qualities The potential of these International Journal of Earth Sciences lithologies as reservoirs was also recognized by Saller et al 2016 for the Kwanza Basin The highest poroperm values obtained through petrographic image analysis petrophysics and high-resolution CT-scan in this study were associated to spherulitic and intraclastic grainstones rudstones However such high poroperm values are only achieved by samples affected by matrix dissolution e g sample Bp5 The importance of matrix dissolution for reservoir quality in the Brazilian pre-salt is also acknowledged by Herlinger et al 2017 and Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Spherulite and hybrid form-dominated facies affected by silicification dolomitization and dolomite-cementation and laminated dolomudstones are usually non-reservoirs presenting very low porosity e g F3 Figs 9 11d Exceptions are represented by intervals marked by intense fracturing As demonstrated by the tomography analysis the laminated dolomudstones facies may have significant porosity related to the fracture system F4 Fig 9 The significant difference between segmented porosity and pore connectivity from high-resolution CT-scan and poroperm measured by the gas tests and NMR indicates the importance of pores below 40 m CT-scan resolution limit Even for samples dominated by macroporosity pores below 40 m generally comprise more than half of the pore system and are responsible for great part of pore connectivity Vuggy-cavernous and breccia porosity possibly related to fluid percolation and karstification were recognized in the pre-salt deposits Menezes de Jesus 2016 Vieira de Luca et al 2017 Duarte et al 2018 but did not significantly affect the studied core interval Conclusions A detailed sedimentological and petrophysical investigation of Cretaceous pre-salt lacustrine carbonates from Southeast Brazil was performed based on core samples and nondestructive multi-scale petrophysical analyses The target core interval is characterized by an assemblage of unusual calcite precipitates and grains including crystal shrubs spherulites hybrid forms and intraclasts These carbonates present outstanding petrophysical heterogeneity that reflects non-actualistic depositional conditions complex diagenetic patterns and possible hydrothermal influence that overprinted the initial fabric-controlled pore network The best reservoir potential is associated to facies developed during stable lowstand shallow water and moderateto-high energy settings mainly shrubby framestones and spherulitic intraclastic grainstones rudstones However petrophysical data from different sources and scales evidenced that even these facies may present a wide range of poroperm values Most of the target interval has a hybrid poroperm system control between depositional and diagenetic factors Post-depositional processes mainly dolomite cementation dolomitization silicification and dissolution seem to play a greater role on determining the final porosity Facies dominated by crystal shrubs with preserved enhanced growth framework porosity and reworked spherulites intraclasts associated to matrix dissolution presented the best reservoir characteristics and the latter were associated to the highest poroperm values of the studied interval Cemented shrubby framestones in situ spherulitic hybrid forms packstones and dolomudstones are usually not reservoirs In addition facies characterized by millimeter-to-centimeter thick intercalation of crystal shrubs and fine detrital grains and or spherulites result in increased diagenetic differentiation and decreased poroperm in relation to thick pure shrubby framestones The geological and petrophysical data presented here are expected to contribute to the Brazilian pre-salt explorations and production challenges and form the basis for future research on the still underexplored lacustrine carbonates The limitations faced in this work are related to the relatively small data basis and the difficulty to fully access the petrophysical heterogeneity of these deposits due to resolution limits To encompass the multi-scale porous systems and also maintain sample representativeness new studies on petrophysical data conditioning resolution improvements and upscaling techniques are fundamental In addition multidisciplinary studies are needed to unveil the factors controlling the spatial and temporal patterns of post-depositional modifications A deeper understanding of the dolomitization and silicification process and how to upscale diagenetic and possible hydrothermal information to well-log and seismic data are key to assemble proper 3D geological models

are lacustrine carbonates deposited from the Barremian until the Aptian Preliminary estimates indicate a volume of oil in place OIP on the order of 29 900 MMBOE thereby ranking it as the largest of the pre-salt fields The understanding of pre-salt reservoirs continues to be a challenge because of complex facies distributions and tectono-stratigraphy This study focuses on describing the tectono-stratigraphic framework of B zios Field using criteria from 3-D seismic well log and core data Three-dimensional seismic interpretation reveals the B zios rift configuration as a series of horst graben and half-graben structures which are highly faulted N30W N30E because of a complex transfer zone interpreted in the area Based on seismic interpretation the rift section was subdivided into a lower and upper rift section The lower rift section was strongly affected by normal faults whereas the upper rift was exposed to a less expressive faulting process and has a thinner sedimentary wedge The upper section corresponds to a commonly observed coquina interval the Itapema Formation which serves as the lower pre-salt reservoir in the B zios Field Lastly prior to salt deposition the post-rift mega-sequence sag section is comprised of the Barra Velha Formation which is composed of biotic and abiotic carbonate reservoirs in a complex structural setting Based on core analysis from the 3-BRSA-944A-RJS well the most common facies in the Itapema Formation reservoirs are rudstone and grainstone composed of bivalve shells with an average porosity and permeability of 12 5 and 88 7 md respectively The Barra Velha Formation reservoirs consist of four main carbonate facies spherulites most common crystal shrub carbonate laminates and rare stromatolites which display an average porosity and permeability of 9 4 and 122 6 md respectively Copyright 2021 by The American Association of Petroleum Geologists DOI 10 1306 13722365MSB 14 1853 375 376 TAVARES ET AL INTRODUCTION B zios

Silicification plays an important role in the quality of pre-salt reservoirs resulting in significant heterogeneities that are difficult to predict A better understanding of the distribution of silicified pre-salt reservoirs at the basin scale helps in mapping such heterogeneities and further optimizing responsible hydrocarbon exploration and production Here we investigate a scenario involving the interaction of an internal silica source from Mg-rich clay sedimentary depositional facies and CO2-rich fluid upwelling along deep-rooted faults These are some of the main controlling factors of silicification as confirmed with conceptual and numerical geochemical modeling We present a new modeling workflow integrating forward stratigraphic modeling FSM basin thermal modeling quantitative chemical modeling and map-based analysis to derive silicification probability maps of the Barra Velha Formation in the Santos Basin Brazil FSM simulates with a process-based approach the sediment distribution in the Barra Velha Formation including Mg-rich clay Basin thermal modeling simulates the rock-fluid systems evolution CO2 migration accumulation and concentration in the formation Geochemical modeling provides Mg-clay transformation ratios depending on Mg-clay content of rock matrix and CO2 concentration Combining all elements together enables calculation of basin scale silicification probability maps across the study area Highest probability of silicification is found above uplifted areas known to include Mg-rich clay intense faulting and trapping structures 1 Introduction Silicification is a diagenetic process that affects carbonate aquifers and reservoirs by concurrent dissolution of calcium carbonate and pre cipitation of silica further complexifying the mineralogic heterogeneity of the host rocks and the associated flow properties Bustillo 2010 Such processes have been extensively reported in the pre-salt conti nental carbonate reservoirs of the Brazilian margin Fig 1 whereby not only calcium carbonate but also the magnesium-clay Mg-rich clay rock constituents are demonstrated to be replaced by silica Lima et al 2020 Pereira et al 2023 The silicified pre-salt carbonates are also known to host world-class petroleum systems Beltrao et al 2009 Jones and Chaves 2011 Petersohn 2019 Silicification is also believed to have affected other similar reservoirs such as those of the Kwanza basin on the African continental margin Saller et al 2016 While previous studies aimed at better understanding the implications of diagenetic processes such as silicification Almeida Carvalho et al 2022 on the associated evolution of the reservoir characteristics Lima et al 2020 Pereira et al 2023 often by means of various analytical and static modeling methods Nader 2017 no predictive process-based basin- scale mapping of silicification has been done Previous approaches are essential to understand the controlling factors of such processes and provide the basics for constructing predictive numerical models to delineate the spatial and temporal distribution of silicification across sedimentary basins and reservoirs especially when only few sub-surface data are available The Barra Velha Formation includes broadly silicified reservoir zones as well as major hydrocarbon reservoirs Lima et al 2020 Vieira 2021 Vieira de Luca et al 2017 Silicified intervals are also affected by important carbonate dissolution e g vuggy hypogenic karst increasing considerably reservoir potentials Previous studies demon strated the relationship between silicification and dissolution processes in the Barra Velha Formation and its analogs suggesting strati graphically controlled fluid flow and fluid-rock interactions in deep burial diagenetic

silicified rock facies are not well constrained and could be multiple Some authors associated the silica supply with the alteration of volcanic products occurring in catchment areas lakes or the subsurface through hydrothermal activity Pietzsch et al 2020 Szatmari and Milani 2016 Teboul et al 2017 2019 Tosca and Wright 2015 Serpentinization of exhumed continental mantle has also been suggested as a source of solutes including silica Pinto et al 2017 Teboul et al 2019 Alternatively the alteration of Mg-clays has been suggested to be the main source of Mg2 and SiO2 aq for the silicifica tion and dolomitization of in pre-salt deposits Deocampo 2005 Tosca and Wright 2015 since Mg-clays are known to be chemically labile and prone to rapid destabilization and dissolution during diagenesis Tosca 2014 Tosca and Wright 2015 In the case of an internal silica source understanding the initial sediment mineralogy distribution as well as the fluid properties and circulation via deeply rooted faults is essential to identify the most likely areas of silica precipitation Several phases of silicification are reported from petrographic anal ysis and proposed paragenesis Sartorato et al 2020 Vieira 2021 In this contribution we propose that the destabilization of Mg-rich clays was the major driver for this first and most significant phase which is preceding hydrocarbon charge and the arrival of organic acids The major CO2 charge of the basin is assumed to be mantellic in origin de Freitas et al 2022 Based on this hypothesis we deduce that the sig nificant dissolution particularly of carbonates happened after the first phase of silicification The CO2 generated from organic matter maturation hydrocarbons and organic acids may have also contributed to the dissolution of Mg-rich clays silicification and carbonate dissolu tion Their impact is considered minor compared to the first phase of silicification and consequently we did not take those processes into ac count Hydrocarbon generation migration and accumulation were still calculated in our model but we did not consider hydrocarbon fluid-rock interactions The main objective of this study is to apply a new integrative workflow to predict the spatial distribution of silicification and its timing at the basin scale Fig 2 Our approach combines different nu merical modeling technologies to simulate in three dimensions the evolution of the basin over time including stratigraphy burial pressure and temperature salinity CO2 migration hydrocarbon generation and charge as well as diagenesis i e carbonate silicification We applied this workflow on the Santos basin offshore Brazil to demonstrate its feasibility and its ability to provide probable silicification maps across the basin First Forward Stratigraphic Modeling FSM which simulates sedimentation processes was applied together with sensitivity analysis modeling Then Basin Thermal Modeling was used to simulate the coupled transfers of fluids heat and chemicals Results of the principal process-based simulators were combined with the output of a quanti tative geochemical simulation of the main parameters controlling silic ification Collard et al 2023 to process map-based analysis and produce silification probability maps Fig 2 2 Geological setting The Santos Basin is one of the largest sedimentary basins along the Brazilian continental margin with a surface area of 352 000 km2 and a water depth of up to 3000m Fig 1 It is bounded to the south by the Floriano polis platform which forms its natural boundary with the Pe lotas basin To the north the Cabo Frio High separates it from the Campos basin These passive-margin basins were formed in a Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous extensional regime during the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent which led to the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean Chang et al 1990 Mohriak et al 2008 They are therefore also related to the Kwanza and Namibe basins offshore southwest Africa Saller et al 2016 The tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the Santos basin is repre sented by three mega-sequences that are associated to a rift phase 138 123 My a post-rift sag phase 123 113 My and a drift phase 113 0 My Moreira et al 2007 These phases and related mega-sequences are also characterized by major unconformities the Pre -Alagoas unconformity which separates the rift and sag phases the Intra-Alagoas unconformity and the salt base which marks the transi tion from the sag to the drift phase Fig 3 The early rifting phase was characterized by extension and asthenospheric uplift Mckenzie 1978 White and Mckenzie 1988 giving rise to tholeiitic flood basalts Mohriak et al 2008 Torsvik et al 2009 Turner et al 1994 dated at 134 122 My Mizusaki et al 1988 The rift phase is dominated by fluvio-lacustrine deposits talc-stevensite ooids with interlayered lacustrine coquinas and organic-rich shales of the Pi arras and Itapema formations Moreira et al 2007 These are overlain by the regional Pre -Alagoas unconformity formed by previous uplift and erosion of the rift section Dias 2005 Karner and Driscoll 1999 Winter et al 2007 Thermal contraction of the crust resulted in subsidence and the collapse of crustal domes creating sag-type basins Beasley et al 2010 This sag phase is characterized by the deposition of stromatolites microbalites and Mg-rich shales in a lacustrine Fig 1 a Location of the Santos Basin South Atlantic offshore Brazil b Area of interest within the region of the outer high of the Santos Basin c Close-up of the area of interest

Chart modified from Moreira et al 2007 environment forming the Barra Velha Formation Mann and Rigg 2012 Moreira et al 2007 Terra et al 2010 During the drift phase the Santos basin became a passive margin and the development of oceanic crust established a marine environment Aslanian et al 2009 Chang et al 1990 1992 Moreira et al 2007 The Ariri Formation overlying the Barra Velha Formation is characterized by transitional evaporites deposited in a gulf type environment with highly saline waters and a negative hydrologic balance Chang et al 1992 It forms a regional seal up to 2 km thick Beasley et al 2010 Mohriak et al 2008 Moreira et al 2007 Quirk et al 2013 Previous studies demonstrated that the Outer High area central part of Santos basin Fig 1 was already a paleo-high at the time of the deposition of the Barra Velha Formation Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 The lake deposits in the Barra Velha Formation as well as the equivalent formations offshore Brazil are in a rift basin whereby horsts and grabens prevailed with associated small islands surrounded by large or small lakes whose connectivity may have varied trough time Pietzsch et al 2018 The shoreline through which detrital input took place was far away to the west Dias 2005 whereas the in-situ car bonate deposits appear to be laterally continuous for many kilometers Carminatti et al 2008 These carbonates are often characterized by three main textural components shrubstones spherulitestones and fine micritic material Wright and Barnett 2015 2 1 Facies types of Barra Velha Formation BVF Different facies types have been identified in the pre-salt deposits of the Barra Velha Formation in the Santos Basin and their equivalents can be found in the adjacent Campos and Pelotas basins Lima and De Ros 2019 as well as the Namibian and Kwanza basins Saller et al 2016 Gomes et al 2020 distinguish three in situ formed end member facies types based on the detailed analysis of eight wells and 389 m of core 3 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 data mud dolomite calcite silica and Mg-rich clay calcite spheru lites and fascicular calcite shrubs When the spherulites and shrubs were subject to erosion and transport their debris can form a fourth facies type referred to as the reworked facies The mud end member is composed of different clay minerals e g kerolite stevensite saponite illite and mixed-layer minerals kerolite smectite and illite smectite Madrucci et al 2019 Souza et al 2018 Creamy to light brown in color it shows massive beds or plane-parallel to smooth wavy laminations with thicknesses varying from a few mm to cm Clay minerals and carbonate mud are locally replaced by dolomite and microcrystalline silica Lighter laminas appear to be composed of microcrystalline calcite and darker laminas are composed of micro crystalline and rhombohedral dolomite and organic matter Siliciclastic grains ostracod and phosphatic particles are also found in the mud Gomes et al 2020 Spherulites are spherical calcite aggregates with a radial structure that are commonly dolomitized or recrystallized Gomes et al 2020 measured spherulites on thin sections and calculated a diameter range of 0 1 4 mm with a mean of 1 mm and a mode of 0 6 mm Due to the small variance in size the same formation mechanisms are assumed for all examined spherulites A nucleus in the center is rarely identified which may be cryptocrystalline micrite clay minerals or ostracods The orig inal fibrous appearance is mostly preserved but it can be lost due to chalcedony and microquartz replacement The spherulites seem to favor an upward growth but in special cases the spherulites can grow parallel to the bedding Intermediate forms between spherulites and shrubs also exist The term shrub refers to very coarse-bladed calcite crystal crusts in a fan-like structure that show perpendicular grow along an axis pointing away from the substrate from which they originate Folk et al 1985 Gomes et al 2020 found that the long axis of the shrubs in the Barra Velha Formation is between 0 15 and 6 5 mm They grow in a parallel fashion with distances between individual shrub axes ranging from 0 2 to 4 mm and occasionally contain fine detrital material The shrubs form horizontal layers and can locally form dome-like structures Rezende and Pope 2015 Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 Occasionally shrubs can exhibit multiple growth phases resulting in composite shrubs as large as 20 mm action and currents Arienti et al 2018 Artaga o 2018 Ceraldi and Green 2017 Gomes et al 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Sartorato 2018 Tanaka et al 2018 Wright and Barnett 2015 2017 The presence of the mud matrix suggests that transport did not occur Herlinger et al 2017 Spherulites most likely formed at the sediment-water interface in an alkaline environment rich in dissolved organic acids Mercedes-Mart n et al 2016 One possibility could be that the spherulites of the Barra Velha Formation formed around bac terial clumps present in the water column and then slowly settled down until they reached the sediment-water interface Gomes et al 2020 where they continued their spherical incremental growth pattern like the mechanism proposed for other alkaline lake systems Mercedes-Mart n et al 2017 Reworked sediments are found at the paleo-highs interfingering with intervals of shrubs and spherulites but also farther from the highs in the more basin dominated areas The reworked sediments are the debris of shrubs and spherulites created during episodes of lower lake levels causing erosion and was transported away from the paleo-highs by gravitational currents Away from the paleo-highs laminated micrite and Mg-rich clays dominate in the paleo-lows Due to their small grain size both sedi ments require a low energy environment to settle down below the wave base They are interpreted to have formed in the deeper and undisturbed parts of the lacustrine environment Near to the paleo-highs some areas are locally characterized by some amounts of preserved Mg-rich clays Protection from wave energy in localized smaller basins paleo-lows could have allowed Mg-rich clay to accumulate there suggesting that they can still occur at shallow water depths but require a low energy environment 2 3 Tectonic and climatic controlling factors Tectonic and climatic cycles as well as sea level fluctuations are inter-related and have a tremendous impact on sediment erosion transport deposition and accommodation space They are the major controlling factors and drivers for the creation of different depositional environments in sedimentary basins Catuneanu et al 2009 Mack 1978 Nichols 2009 Tectonics and eustasy affect the accommodation space of the basin which is the space available for sediments to accu mulate over time Climate on the other hand has a more indirect effect on the accommodation by controlling the sediment available for depo sition For example it limits the amount of sediment that can be trans ported into the basin or the rate of growth of biogenic sediments Other factors such as wave energy or currents are also determined by climate Catuneanu et al 2009 Eustatic sea level fluctuations are controlled by both tectonics and climate on different time scales On the larger strat igraphic orders third stratigraphic order and above the driving factor is tectonic mechanisms such as continental formation and break up or regional plate kinematics Time scales for sea level changes range from 200 to 400 My first stratigraphic order to 1 10 My third stratigraphic order For smaller stratigraphic orders cycles fourth and fifth strati graphic orders global climatic changes e g caused by Milankovitch cycles with duration of 0 01 1 My are the main driving force Catuneanu et al 2009 Miall 2000 Vail et al 1977 The cyclical deposition of the Barra Velha Formation facies described above has been observed and associated to the interplay between tectonic and climatic cycles affecting the Santos basin Arienti et al 2018 Artaga o 2018 Dias 2005 Farias et al 2019 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Sartorato 2018 Wright and Barnett 2015 The basin-wide un conformities that bound the Barra Velha Formation at the top Salt base and bottom Pre -Alagoas and internally Intra-Alagoas represent such interplay and were used to further subdivide the stratigraphic units For example the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity divides the Barra Velha For mation in a Lower Barra Velha Formation and an Upper Barra Velha 2 2 Conceptual sedimentological model The relief of the Outer High central part of Santos basin Fig 1 was very similar to what can be seen today on seismic reflection profiles Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 allowing the definition of two distinct types of depositional environments i e paleo-highs and adja cent paleo-lows that are also supported by lithological information from well data Fig A1a Due to such relief configuration the condi tions for sedimentary deposition differed in terms of bathymetry but also in terms of other sediment control factors such as wave energy The depositional environment of the paleo-highs is strongly influ enced by lake level fluctuations and even shows signs of exposure during lake level low stands Gomes et al 2020 The paleo-highs are domi nated by the presence of shrubs that grew in an upward vertical di rection from a substratum Basso et al 2020 They are found in their in-situ position indicating that they were not transported Shrubs form horizontal layers and locally low domal structures Rezende and Pope 2015 Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 Biological factors may play a role in the initiation of shrub growth invoking growth in a shallow water depth in the range of the photic zone Ceraldi and Green 2017 Gomes et al 2020 Shrubs also require wave energy for their development In the Kwanza basin very similar facies to shrubs have been observed and have been interpreted to have formed positive structures on paleo-highs like modern reefs requiring both light and wave energy for their development Saller et al 2016 Spherulites are also present on the paleo-highs but they indicate a higher lake level during the time of deposition protected from wave 4 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 Formation The sequences have been dated using ostracods and span a time frame of about 10 My 123 113 My as well as deposited sequence thicknesses of several 100 s m Gomes et al 2020 Moreira et al 2007 Pietzsch et al 2018 These sequences correspond to third-order stratigraphic cycles suggesting a tectonic origin A general change in lithology can be observed from the Lower Barra Velha For mation to the Upper Barra Velha Formation The Lower Barra Velha Formation is largely dominated by Mg-rich clays micrites and reworked facies whereas the Upper Barra Velha Formation is mostly composed of in-situ formed sediments Gomes et al 2020 It is noteworthy that the Mg-rich clays increase just above the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity and decrease progressively towards the top Basic repeating high frequency cycles have been identified in the Barra Velha Formation representing fourth to fifth order cycles with the climate as the driving factor behind the formation of these cycles Fourth order cycles are in the range of 100 400 ky and have a thickness of 10 50m Eccentricity is considered to be the underlying cause Fifth order cycles are in the range of 20 50 ky and have a thickness in the meter scale ranging between 1 and 10m They are well identified on the lithology logs as shown by Gomes et al 2020 Obliquity and pre cession are thought to be the underlying mechanism causing these re petitive cycles In an idealized sequence a fourth-order cycle in the Barra Velha Formation starts out at the base with laminated carbonates deposited during the maximum lake level Fig A1b As the lake level decreases alkalinity and microbial action increase creating favorable conditions for the formation of mm-large spherulites Gomes et al 2020 Mercedes-Mart n et al 2017 These are followed by mm-cm sized calcitic crystal shrubs and crusts Wright and Barnett 2015 When the lake level is at its lowest previously deposited sediments may be exposed and reworked Towards the top of an idealized cycle grainstones composed mainly of fragments of previously deposited facies and absent of matrix complete the cycle suggesting deposition in a high-energy environment Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 The reworked sediments due to their origin can occur at any time during a sequence and are therefore not a reliable component for calibration 3 Data and methods The selected study area covers a 48 km 98 km rectangular zone on the Outer High in the Santos Basin offshore Brazil Fig 1 The used dataset was compiled and provided by Petrobras Hard input data for model construction were taken from three interpreted seismic horizons and seven wells with markers and lithological logs Fig 4 The seismic horizons available were the top and base of the Barra Velha Formation and the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity The top and base of the Barra Velha Formation and the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity were also present as well markers Formation boundaries were dated using the Moreira et al 2007 stratigraphic chart which places the top of the Barra Velha For mation at 113 My the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity at 117 My and the base of the Barra Velha formation at 122 My The lithology classes were simplified by regrouping the 15 classes identified by Gomes et al 2020 into five respective classes Table 2 The applied workflow integrates as mentioned above process based modeling software packages as well as geochemical analysis solutions Fig 4 Cross section for the seven available wells showing the lithology logs and the two unconformities bordering the Barra Velha Formation Wells located at the flank of the paleo high show a predominance for Mg-rich clays especially around the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity The paleo high is dominated by shrubstone and spherulitestone Reworked sediment occurs on the paleo high and flanks BVF Barra Velha Formation SBU Salt Base

tual sedimentological model and input data provided realistic maps of the sedimentological facies distribution These were used as an input data for the basin thermal model which provides a detailed prediction of the other parameters that are believed to control silicification over time namely pressure temperature and CO2 concentration in water Collard et al 2023 The simulated facies maps the basin modeling output maps namely that of CO2 distribution together with the transformation ratios of clays to silica defined by means of geochemical modeling see Collard et al 2023 were combined to produce through map-based analysis the silicification probability maps Fig 2 These steps are described in detail here below model for each time step at a given interval The result is a highresolution geologic model showing sedimentary distribution and facies architecture The model can be used to quantify sedimentary processes through time for a specific location providing a deeper understanding of geological evolution as was done in this study for the Barra Velha For mation of the Santos Basin whereby the constructed model spatial resolution is 1 km 1 km with a time step of 0 25 million years My Calibration is an essential part of numerical modeling to achieve a realistic result with comparison to available data In this study seismic reflection data interpreted horizons and thickness maps and well data were used to compare and adjust the simulation results An important final step was the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to identify most influential simulation parameters 3 1 Forward stratigraphic modeling FSM 3 1 1 Input data for FSM The main input data for the forward stratigraphic model were sediment types with associated carbonate accumulation curves see Fig 5 lake level variation curve wave energy gravitational sediment transportation paleo bathymetry and subsidence maps Table 1 The five sediment types were defined for the forward stratigraphic model to represent the known dominant BVF facies In a post processing step after the initial simulation facies types were defined based on pro portions of sediment types in the cells Table 3 These facies types were used for calibration with the original well data Forward stratigraphic modeling FSM is a 3D process-based approach to modeling geologic processes through time and space Based on physical laws FSM enables to model precise sedimentary facies distribution which is an important input parameter to better constrain basin thermal modeling DionisosFlow a software for stratigraphic forward modeling developed by IFP Energies nouvelles and BeicipFranlab was used in this study Granjeon 1996 Granjeon and Joseph 1999 This software can simulate the production transport and accu mulation of different sediment types on basin scale 10 100 km and over long-time intervals 100 Ka 100 Ma It was also used to model sedimentary systems below the fifth order Busson et al 2019 Csato et al 2014 Rabineau et al 2005 accounting for accommodation space variation by a fluctuation of an eustatic sea level curve and or by subsidence It allows to model siliciclastic carbonate and mixed sedi ments as well as the distribution of marine and terrestrial organic matter in different environments ranging from lacustrine and shallow marine to deep marine Andres et al 2008 Bassant and Harris 2008 Bruneau et al 2018

2011 Sediment transport is simulated by an empirical diffusion equation that can be driven by gravity and or water Granjeon 1996 Granjeon and Joseph 1999 Deposited sediments can be eroded again e g by

Stratigraphic forward models are constructed at the larger basin scale resolution in time and space as mentioned above Detailed smaller scale facies definition e g high resolution well-log description microscopic analysis may be less relevant than the dominant end-member groups of facies e g muddominated grain-dominated in-situ sediments This is important for stratigraphic modeling as it allows to focus the simulations on the dominant facies that ultimately create differential stratigraphic patterns The detailed BVF facies described from seven well-logs Gomes et al 2020 were regrouped into five dominant facies The end-member facies of in-situ growing shrub and spherulite each containing more than 90 of shrub or spherulite were grouped into shrubstone and spherulite stone respectively Table 2 All facies containing less than 90 shrub or spherulite and less than 90 fine grain fraction were grouped into the facies Mg-rich mudstone Table 2 Mud-dominated facies with a significant carbonate content calcite and dolomite were referred to as Fig 5 Normalized carbonate production curves for the 4 sediment types shrub spherulite Mg-rich clay and micrite 6 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 micrite characterize the flanks and basins The Lower BVF where basin and flank depositional environments prevail is dominated by Mg-rich mudstone micrite and reworked facies The Upper BVF is dominated by shrubstone spherulitestone and Mg-rich mudstone Mg-clay is especially abundant above the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity For FSM these dominant facies correspond to a mixture with specific pro portions of sediment types that will be detailed below Section 3 1 1 7 Table 1 List of the principal input parameters and their values used for forward strati graphic

production accumulation model and sediment trans formation rates Carbonate in-situ accumulation rates were calculated based on the age limits and thicknesses of the Upper and Lower BVF They are in the range of 50 m Ma to 80 m Ma for the Lower BVF and increase to 80 m Ma to 120 m Ma in the Upper BVF see Table 1 which is in the same order of magnitude observed in other carbonate systems in the geological record Bosscher and Schlager 1993 Carbonate accu mulation rates are not equivalent to carbonate production rates which can be much higher and in the order of magnitude of 7 9 mm yr of recent coral reefs Kinsey 1985 This is because carbonate deposits can be again eroded and transformed after deposition In this study we focused on adjusting the carbonate accumulation rates of individual sediment types to match the observed thicknesses distribution pat terns and well data of the Lower and Upper BVF For the Lower BVF the following carbonate accumulation rates were used 50 m My for shrub 50 m My for spherulite 60 m My for Mg-rich clay 80 m My for micrite For the Upper BVF the following carbonate accumulation rates were used 120 m My for shrub 100 m My for spherulite 80 m My for Mg-rich clay 80 m My for micrite Normalized production curves as a function of water depth are shown in Fig 5 Shrub growth was influenced by biological factors indicating for mation in shallow water depths in the photic zone requiring additionally wave energy for their development like modern reefs Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2017 Gomes et al 2020 Therefore the production zone was limited to the first 20m of the water column An additional constraint in form of wave energy was added to the production of shrub and their production only happens in areas where wave energy exceeds 20 kW m Spherulites are found on the palo-high in association with shrub and a Mg-rich mud matrix which is why the production windows was set between the two other sediment types and below the fair-weather wave base The Mg-rich clay production window is situated in the sublittoral zone of the lake below the spherulite window They require high pH 9 5 for their formation and elevated methane levels and associated acidity due to organic sediment accumulation would prevent formation at deeper bathymetries Tosca and Wright 2014 Micrite is found mainly in the deeper bathymetries of the lake in the form of finely laminated clays indicating deposition in a calm and un disturbed environment not influenced by waves or storms and repre senting a pelagic background sedimentation Reworked

constructed from the lithology logs of representative wells for the paleohigh and paleo-low areas in the model For each lithology type present in the logs a relative lake level was assigned according to the conceptual depositional model Lithologies associated with a deeper bathymetry during formation were assigned a number close to 1 and lithologies associated with shallower bathymetries were assigned values closer to 0 see Table A1 Consequently a relative lake level variation curve was obtained which depicts the tendencies of relative lake level deepening and shallowing The curve was then readjusted to account for the time required for sediment deposition The depositional time for the different lithologies varies depending on grain size and mode of formation A time 30 micrite Table 2 Grainstone packstone wackestone facies that are not formed in-situ were combined into reworked facies Table 2 Shrubstone and spherulitestone characterize the paleo-high deposi tional environment whereas reworked facies Mg-rich mudstone and 7 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 step of 0 1m was chosen and relative depositional rates were derived for each lithology Table A2 Finally the curve was normalized for a fluctuating lake level between 0 and 50m where 50m is considered the maximum lake level to cover the production window for Mg-rich clays Fig A2a 3 1 1 8 Subsidence Subsidence maps were calculated in a twofold step based on seismic horizon data which was considered as hard data and has therefore not been modified First the accumulated sediment thickness was computed by subtracting bottom seismic horizon from top seismic horizon for the Upper BVF and the Lower BVF respectively Then the maps were converted to time unit m My by dividing the thickness maps by their relative deposition time interval Fig A4 Subsidence is assumed linear for each modeled time interval This simplification is minimizing the number of unknow factors and facili tates the correlation with the hard data Calculated values for subsidence in the Lower BVF are 30 m My on the paleo high and 100 150 m My in the basin area Calculated values for subsidence in the Upper BVF are 50 80 m My on the paleo high and 100 250 m My in the basin area Sediment compaction was not considered and no back-stripping was applied for the constructions of the incorporated subsidence maps in the stratigraphic model 3 1 1 4 Wave energy Wave energy is a critical factor in the develop ment of shrubstone and reworked facies Saller et al 2016 For com parable wind speeds wave bases are shallower in lakes than in the ocean domain Gilbert 1999 A 1D wave model was chosen in which wave energy decreases from top to bottom and is a function of the bathymetry The wave base was set at 10m and the wave energy is highest between 3 and 13m of bathymetry reaching a peak of 40 kW m at 5m bathymetry Fig A2b 3 1 1 5 Paleo-topography Paleo-topographic surfaces were used as boundary conditions for the forward stratigraphic simulation They were reconstructed from associated seismic horizons as previous research showed that the Pre-Salt field high was also a paleo-high throughout the Barra Velha Formation deposition Gomes et al 2020 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Lithology logs were analyzed for the Pre-Salt field high and flanks and the paleo-bathymetries were deduced Table A2 Using the derived paleo-bathymetry information a normalization factor was applied to the seismic horizons to create a paleo-topographic surface for each horizon Fig A3 3 1 2 Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of FSM Sensitivity analysis aims to better understand the uncertainty in the output of model simulations and assesses the impacts of various uncer tain input parameters on the modelling results It allows for checking the robustness of the model when uncertainty is introduced and for further understanding the relationship between the input parameters and the output of the model e g unexpected relationships may indicate errors Through such analysis the parameters with the highest impacts on the modelling results can be distinguished and investigated furthermore In this study the software CougarFlow Gervais et al 2018 was used to get a global understanding on the sensitivity of the processes influencing the Mg-rich clay distribution Based on the achieved FSM simulation meta models were built for each parameter potentially influencing the simulation result using a Latin Hypercube Design These meta models are in a second step used for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis of the critical input parameters for the simulation Latin Hypercube Design was chosen instead of performing a Monte Carlo sampling due to its advantages in terms of computation time and cost The whole simulation area was selected as a zone of interest for the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis The average percentage of sediment type Mg-rich clay present in each cell of the simulation has been selected as the result of interest An un certainty range 20 of the original simulation parameter was chosen The following 7 parameters were tested for their impact in average Mgrich clay percentage eustasy wave energy subsidence sediment transport carbonate production versus time carbonate production versus depth and sediment transformation rate The sensitivity analysis to determine the most influential parame ters is done by creating a multidimensional response surface in the parameter space which honors the data exactly In a next step a mathematical response surface is generated which is a mathematically reliable representation of all the parameter combinations The fit be tween the multidimensional and the mathematical response surface shows the predictivity of the model and is expressed with a number between 0 and 1 The better the fit and values close to 1 the higher the predictivity and therefore robustness of the model 3 1 1 6 Sediment transport Sediment transport processes and parame ters were defined from an analysis of sedimentary paleoenvironments The paleo-high is strongly influenced by lake level fluctuations and signs of exposure during lake level low stands can be found Gomes et al 2020 Shrub on the paleo-high grew from a substratum in an upward and vertical direction and forming horizontal layers with domal struc tures Presence of in-situ position indicates no transport Basso et al 2020 Rezende and Pope 2015 Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 The association of spherulite with a Mg-rich mud matrix also suggests that there was no transport after formation Herlinger et al 2017 Therefore sediment transport is modeled following a linear diffusion gravitational transport law taking into consideration the local gradient of surface elevation z The sediment flux in the model Qs is calculated following the equation Qs Kslope z The transport coefficient Kslope defines the efficiency of sediment transport and varies with the sediment type The values for the coeffi cient Kslope were assumed very low to prevent the transport of shrub In an iterative approach various order of magnitudes for the transport coefficient values were tested according to a range of values from the literature Bruneau et al 2017 Busson et al 2019 Granjeon 2019 The values for the coefficient Kslope were selected by an iterative approach so that the modeled sediment distribution fits the observed lithofacies data in the wells Table 1 3 1 1 7 Facies definition In a forward stratigraphic model each grid cell contains a mix of the simulated sediment types in percentage which is a function of the parameters described above Sediment per centage is a continuous parameter and in this study we are interested in lithofacies maps Those maps show the distribution of lithofacies throughout the basin and at different ages - notably Mg-rich mudstone which contribute to the characterization of silicification probability We designed a facies definition matrix which assigns to each cell one discrete facies value based on the percentages of the sediment types present in each cell see Table 3 A value of minimum 30 of the respective sediment type was chosen for the attribution of the lith ofacies class 3 2 Basin thermal modeling Process-based forward numerical modeling of the major processes controlling heat and fluid transfer throughout the entire sedimentary basin and throughout its geological history was achieved using a prototype version of TemisFlow developed by IFP Energies nouvelles and Beicip-Franlab Schneider et al 2000 This technology has become a standard tool for oil and gas exploration and is now being used to address some of the challenges of the energy transition involving the deep subsurface While stratigraphic modeling is used in this study to provide insight into the distribution of stratigraphic facies basin modeling is used to predict the temporal evolution of other factors 8 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 thought to control silicification like pressure and temperature Salinity and CO2 concentration in water could also be simulated with a new prototype module for simulating the transfer of dissolved components and calculating the thermodynamic equilibrium between the aqueous and vapor phase Special attention was given to the fault system which is precisely mapped in the study area and which may be the pathways for the CO2-rich fluids First a basin-scale geomodel covering the area of interest is con structed Fig 6 which is calibrated against pressure and temperature data referred to as original model The original model was updated to include results from FSM and is referred to as new model The new model measures 60 km 100 km and is discretized with 250000 cells divided into 21 layers each one corresponding to a depositional event The pre-salt formations are discretized by 8 layers corresponding to the following time intervals 125Myrs 123 Myrs 123Myrs 121 Myrs 121Myrs 119 Myrs 119Myrs 117 Myrs 117Myrs 116 3 Myrs 116 3Myrs 115 2 Myrs 115 2Myrs 114 1 Myrs and 114 1Myrs 113 Myrs The bounding box of the stratigraphic model described above delineates a subdomain of the new basin model and is hereafter referred to as the FSM sub-model 3 2 1 Lithofacies distribution A lithofacies map was assigned to each layer of the model Fig 7 Lithofacies from the original model were not modified outside of the FSM subdomain Five new lithofacies were used to model the spatial distribution of petrophysical properties within the FSM subdomain corresponding to the five simplified facies used in the DionisosFlow model namely spherulitestone shrubstone Mg-rich mudstone micrite and reworked facies Faults were added to the model according to available observations in a restricted area around the Pre-Salt field reservoir Six other new facies were created to model the cells which are intersected by these faults Spherulitestone fractured Shrubstone fractured Mg-richmudstone fractured Mudstone fractured Micrite fractured and Reworked fractured It is very likely that other faults exist in other areas of the basin but no data were available The dominant facies maps of the 8 pre-salt layers were then exported from DionisosFlow model and re-sampled onto the basin modeling Fig 7 Facies map of the top pre-salt layer deposited during the 114 1Myrs 113 Myrs time interval The black dotted line represents the Pre-Salt field anticline axis grid The resulting lithofacies maps were completed by assigning the fractured lithofacies to the cells intersected by fault lineaments or above the Outer-High regional fault Finally a highly permeable lithofacies referred to as previous boundary in Fig 7 was applied in one-cell-thick surfaces along the domain lateral boundaries and in all layers of the model to allow the expulsion of compaction fluids without the devel opment of overpressure as observed in the area This method of pre venting overpressure was preferred to a simple hydrostatic boundary condition because it also prevents inflow of external fluid that could disturb the simulated salinity and CO2 concentration fields 3 2 2 Petrophysical properties Assigning petrophysical properties to the different lithofacies of the model was a challenging problem because petrophysical measurements are made on samples that have been altered by diagenesis making them poorly representative of the rock properties before silicification We assigned the petrophysical properties of the two porous sandstones of the original model to all lithofacies of the FSM subdomain to preserve the good calibration of the original model The Schneider model Schneider et al 1996 is used for compaction and the Kozeny-Carman model is used for the permeability versus porosity relationship A correction factor of 0 001 was then applied to the permeability of the argillaceous lithofacies Since faults were assumed to be the vectors for the upward migration of CO2 they were modeled as privileged flow paths even though no data is available to confirm this hypothesis except that the CO2 content of the water observed in the Pre-Salt field reservoir is indeed high Jia et al 2020 We increased the vertical permeability of the cells intersected by fault lineaments or along the Outer-High regional fault by a factor of 10 considering that the damage zone fills 10 of the cell volume with a permeability 100 times higher than in the undamaged rock Fig A5 shows the permeability maps of the pre-salt layer at 112 Myrs in the original and in the new model Once completed the geomodel was back-stripped automatically according to the porosity versus depth curves assigned to each lithofacies Fig 6 General presentation of the basin model a contour of the FSM submodel b 2 cross-sections of the basin model colored by facies showing the model base in grey pre-salt

-B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 evolution two-phase fluid flow and compaction as well as petroleum maturation expulsion and migration These processes are part of the state-of-the-art basin thermal modeling whereas modeling the trans port of dissolved salt and CO2 was achieved through an in-house pro totype described separately below We applied a multiplication factor to the normalized CO2 production map The CO2 production at the bottom of the sediments was held constant from the initial time of basin formation until 113 106 years the time when rifting has ceased After some trial and error we set the maximum production to 7000 kg m2 106 years to observe a significant CO2 concentration in the Pre-Salt field reservoir as is currently observed This CO2 production is the maximum production flux we could find in the literature It was obtained by combining the maximum mantle flux of crustal 3He proposed by Torgersen 1993 and the mantle 3 He CO2 ratio proposed by Marty and Jambon 1987 The final CO2 production flux at the base of the sediments is shown in Fig 6 3 2 3 1 Forward simulations of temperature two-phase flow and compaction and the petroleum system Temperature is an important parameter to simulate because it controls CO2 solubility and most geochemical reactions at depth including thermogenic hydrocarbon production It also controls fluid viscosity and fluid density and hence fluid flow For this study we applied a time-varying heat flux map at the base of the model extracted from the original model In the latter the thermal model simulated the thermal coupling between the sediments and the crust during the rifting sequence following the McKenzie-type crustal model implemented in the TemisFlow advanced basement tool This full thermal model was based on a calibrated map of the crustal stretching factor assumed to prevail during the rifting The two-phase fluid flow is simulated using the Visco calculator of TemisFlow with a fully implicit generalized Darcy flow migration scheme The gaseous phase consists of hydrocarbons and CO2 The simulation provides predictions of porosity pressure and saturation of the two phases as well as flow velocity in all cells of the models at the end of each depositional event Flow and compaction are largely controlled by the petrophysical properties assigned to each lithofacies In our simulations compaction is the sole driver of the water flow as the bottom boundary and the lateral boundaries were prescribed as no water flow boundaries The source rock is located below the reservoir layers in layer 2 numbered from bottom to top It is assigned a Type I kerogen and a uniform TOC of 4 A 5-class compositional kinematic scheme is applied 3 2 4 Map-based analysis The distributions of Mg-rich clay content output of DionisosFlow simulations Fig 8a and the aqueous CO2 concentration that was calculated by TemisFlow were post-processed to populate the pre-salt reservoir layers with an indicator of the probability that clay has been converted to silica Collard et al 2023 demonstrated that Mg-rich clay dissolution and quartz precipitation are directly controlled by aqueous CO2 content with no significant first order effect of pressure and tem perature These authors further quantified the effect of aqueous CO2 concentration and Mg-rich clay content on the rate of silicification by means of a dedicated geochemical modeling workflow We have embedded the results of geochemical modeling Collard et al 2023 in our post-processing workflow by deriving specific in tervals of CO2 concentration and Mg-rich clay content and assigning to each interval the corresponding estimate of the transformation ratio of Mg-rich clay after 10 years Table 4 We then used this transformation ratio and the Mg-rich clay content to calculate a net transformation ratio NTR which represents the fraction of the total rock matrix that has been converted to silica Since many of the uncertainties discussed below were propagated throughout the workflow we felt that the relative values of the NTR were more meaningful than the absolute values We present the result in a qualitative manner by assigning a silicification probability indicator to each cell according to the following thresholds i Very low probability NTR 1 ii Low probability NTR in the range 1 6 7 iii Medium probability NTR in the range 6 7 13 and iv High probability NTR 13 Thresholds were chosen so that the cumulative area of high silicifi cation probability across the 8 pre-salt layer maps is approximatively 10 of the cumulative area of low to high probability and the threshold between low and medium probability was chosen so that the cumulative area of very low probability is approximatively half of the total area 3 2 3 2 Forward simulation of dissolved salt and CO2 A prototype version of the Visco simulator was also used to simulate dissolved salt and CO2 transport and the CO2 equilibrium between the water and gas phases Salt solubility versus temperature is calculated using the poly nomial function proposed by Harvie et al 1984 Thermodynamic pa rameters used to calculate CO2 solubility in brines are taken from Duan and Sun 2003 A uniform salinity at the time of sediment deposition is assumed in all layers of the model The depositional salinity of all layers above the salt layer is assumed to be 35 g l In the salt layer and in the sediments deposited between 117 and 113 106 years the depositional salinity is prescribed to be 220 g l according to the salinity data collected in the reservoir which still shows a very high salinity at pre sent At the base of the model six bottom layers a depositional salinity value of 10 g l is prescribed The CO2 content in the layers at the time of deposition is set to 0 throughout the model The CO2 source is assumed to be located at the base of the model and is constrained by a basal CO2 flux map expressed in kg m2 106 years A realistic scenario would be that the CO2 flux at the base of the sediments is controlled by crustal thickening during the rifting We have developed a mathematical transformation of the crustal thickening map that yields a normalized CO2 production map It is consistent with the global hypothesis that CO2 is produced by the regional Outer-High fault and by the magmatic intrusion located beneath the center of the modeled area where x y represents the beta factor map used in the McKenzie-type crustal thermal modeling 2 CO2production x y 4 Results 4 1 Forward stratigraphic modeling 4 1 1 Lower Barra Velha Formation A depositional environment with paleo-bathymetries from 20 to 50m around the paleo-highs about 70m on the nearby flanks and up to about 200m in the offshore basin areas was configured to enable the model the formation of the extensive lacustrine carbonates of the lower Barra Velha Formation Sedimentation occurred in the early post-rift stage of the Santos Basin where subsidence on the paleo highs was up to 30 m Ma and in the offshore area about 100 m Ma reaching locally high values of 150 m Ma Additional accommodation space was generated due to the variation of the eustatic lake level curve which reached a local maximum at about 121 Ma then dropped 40m at 119 Ma before reaching a maximum again at the end of the Lower BVF deposition Best results for thicknesses from well data and seismic horizons as well as facies distribution patterns were obtained with sediment production rate values of 50 m My for spherulite and shrub 60 m My for Mg-rich clays and 80 m My for hemipelagic micrite Fig 5 Table 1 Transformation rates for spherulite and shrub into reworked sediment were fixed at 20 m My Wave energy had to exceed 20 kW m for shrub production to x y 3 Max x y 3 x y This transformation was not based on any geodynamic theory but designed to peak where the stretching factor is the highest and to fall to 0 away from these

fringe of spherulitestone Fig 9 Reworked facies are present on the paleo-highs in permanently exposed areas They also occur on the paleo highs during high lake level and in alternating sequences with micrite and Mg-rich mudstone near the paleo-highs with a higher frequency at the beginning of the lower Barra Velha Formation The intermediate bathymetry of the lake between 30 and 50m near the paleo-highs is dominated by Mg-rich mudstone The deeper offshore areas of the lake are dominated by hemipelagic micritic sediments Mg-rich mudstone occurs predominantly near the paleo-highs in lake bathymetries between 30 and 50m Fig 9 They surround the flanks of the paleo-highs Concentrations of sediment type Mg-rich clay can reach up to about 60 Fig 10 They are particularly high to the west of the paleo-high but highest concentrations are found to the south of the paleo-high The maximum distribution of Mg-rich clay is reached in the Lower Barra Velha Formation at about 119 My when a lowering of the lake level occurred Thickness calibration around the paleo-highs where well data were available shows a mean thickness error of 13m For the entire modeled area the thickness error is 75m Fig A6 Fig 9 Evolution of facies development and correlation with the lake level throughout the Barra Velha Formation Mg-rich mudstones get predominantly deposited at the flanks of the paleo high

values around 50 80m around the paleo-highs and between 100 and 250 m My in the basin area The best results in terms of thickness and facies distribution patterns were obtained by increasing the carbonate production rates of the sediments especially of those presented on the paleo-highs Fig 5 Table 1 The values were 120 m My for shrub 100 m My for spherulite and 80 m My for Mg-rich clay 4 1 2 Upper Barra Velha Formation Paleobathymetries at the base of the Upper BVF are almost identical to those of the Lower BVF but the relief gradually becomes flatter cf Fig A3 At the top of the Upper BVF the relief is only up to 50m for most of the study area which looks like a shallow lake prior to salt deposition The subsidence has a higher range compared to the Lower 11 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 which explains the relatively more varying lithological distribution visible on the facies log Shrubstones spherulitestones and reworked facies that were simulated on the paleo-high correspond to the main facies types present on the well-log well The reworked facies was simulated mainly below the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity which is consistent with the log data Besides shrubstones appear to be more dominant than spherulitestones based on modelling an observation that is also confirmed by the log data Figs 4 and 11 The simulation for well C on the paleo-flank shows an alternation of Mg-rich mudstone and micrite up to the Upper BVF with a maximum of Mg-rich mudstone around the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity Reworked facies are present at the base of the Lower BVF The top of the Upper Barra Velha Formation is dominated by spherulitestones The simulation results are consistent with the general trend visible in the lithology log of well C which shows a transition from micrite to Mg-rich mudstone around the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity to an alternation of spherulitestones and shrubstones at the top The lithology log shows many alternations of Mg-rich mudstone and micrite with reworked facies that could not be reproduced in the simulation Besides the shrubstone intervals at the top of the BVF could not be reproduced for this well 4 1 4 Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of FSM A total of 30 simulations were run following the Latin hypercube design to parameterize the selected uncertain parameters of the model The calculated mathematical response surface shows a predictivity of 0 967 which is close to 1 and therefore shows high predictivity The average percentage of Mg-rich clay for the 30 simulations varies be tween 7 43 and 14 57 Fig 12 shows that four parameters have a significant contribution to the average Mg-rich clay percentage in the model contribution 10 the most influential of which is subsidence 50 1 Carbonate production vs water depth 19 1 carbonate production vs time 15 9 and lake level variation curve 11 7 have a significant influence The rest of the parameters tested have a relatively small effect 0 5

d vertical exagger ation 10 4 2 Basin thermal modeling The lithofacies distribution of the new model has been modified from the calibrated original model see above therefore we first ensured that the new model remained calibrated by comparing the pressure temperature and hydrocarbon saturation over time of the two models There was no significant difference in these quantities the model re mains hydrostatic and the hydrocarbon filling history of the traps is unchanged Production rates for hemipelagic micrite remained constant at 80 m My Sediment transformation rates and wave energy are identical to the Lower Barra Velha Formation The lake level curve has two minima for the Upper BVF at about 116 My and at 113 5 My decreasing by about 40m each time A maximum is reached at 115 My The boundary between the Lower and Upper BVF is characterized by a Mg-rich mudstone interval which is also visible in the well data from the flanks of the paleo-highs Fig 11 Modeling shows that the shrub stones and spherulitestones are more abundant during the lake level maximum at about 115 Ma They appear to transgress from the highs onto the flanks and finally into the basin area especially on the east side of the paleo-high Mg-rich clays are less abundant compared to the Lower Barra Velha Formation but locally reach higher concentrations especially on the eastern flanks of the paleo-high with values of up to 67 Fig 10 Thickness calibration around the paleo-highs where well data is available shows a mean thickness error of 47m For the entire modeled area the thickness error is 80m Fig A6 4 2 1 Paleo-hydrodynamics The general paleo-hydrodynamics in the layers of interest is controlled by the impermeable boundaries the upper boundary con sisting of the salt layer and the bottom and lateral surfaces - and the quasi-hydrostatic pressure at the lateral boundaries which is obtained by imposing a high permeability on a 1-cell layer at the lateral bound aries It follows that the general flow pattern is centripetal and parallel to the stratigraphy Fig 8c with the highest flow velocity in the upper layers as compaction and permeability increase upward The normal to bedding component of the flow velocity is generally much lower but we can observe localized vertical fluid exchange controlled by local permeability heterogeneities Fig 13 Fluid flow velocity is highest immediately after salt deposition with maximum velocities of about 5000 m Myrs in the upper reservoir layer and decreases thereafter After 100 Myrs maximum fluid velocities rarely exceed 50 m Myrs in the area of interest With the new distribution of lithofacies given by the FSM study the increase in permeability along the major faults and the new lateral boundary conditions the paleo-hydrodynamics are likely to have been modified from the original model Fig 13 confirms the difference be tween the fluid flow velocity fields of the two models This is further 4 1 3 Comparison of FSM results and well data Two representative wells one located on the paleo-high well D and the other one on the paleo-flank well C were selected to compare the simulation results with the original facies log from well data Fig 11 An important consideration for calibration is the difference in resolution between the simulation result and the well data The model has a time step of 0 25 My compared to a much finer resolution of the lithology log 12 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 Fig 11 Comparison between the facies logs of the hard data and the facies logs of the simulated data for representative wells on the paleo flank C and on the paleo high D BVF Barra Velha Formation SBU Salt Base Unconformity IAU Intra-Alagoas Unconformity PAU Pre -Alagoas Unconformity 4 2 2 Salinity CO2 concentration and fluid evolution The salinity of the lower pre-salt layers remains constant throughout the simulation while the salinity of the upper pre-salt layers decreases in areas where mixing with low salinity water from below occurs In these areas the rate of salinity decrease is controlled by the velocity of the water flow It follows that the salinity stabilizes during the 106 93 5 Myrs time interval The upper pre-salt salinity map in Fig 8c shows two main NE-SW trending low-salinity plumes one crossing the northern part of the Pre-Salt field anticline and the other one overlying the southern part of the Outer High structure CO2 can migrate both as an advected solute and as a component of the gaseous phase in cells where the water is saturated with CO2 In our simulations where CO2 is injected into the bottom layer at a constant rate until 113 Myrs we observe that a gaseous phase of CO2 appears at 119 Myrs in the bottom layer and starts to migrate upward due to buoyancy and hydrodynamics This upward migration is localized in gas chimneys feeding CO2-rich traps located in the pre-salt layer especially along the Pre-Salt field anticline Figs 13 and 14 In addition hydrodynamics generate plumes of CO2-rich water that emanate from these chimneys and spread horizontally The upper pre-salt layer shows two areas of high aqueous CO2 concentration along the central part of the Pre-Salt field anticline and above the southern part of the Outer Fig 12 Graphical representation of the parameter contribution on Mg-rich clay percentage in the model illustrated by an upward flow in the two base layers of the new model below the anticline whereas no significant hydrodynamic connection between the base layers and the upper reservoir layers could be observed in the original model see Fig 13 13 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 Fig 14 CO2 concentration calculated along the reference cross-sections in the pre-salt layers map view of the cross-sections traces on Fig 6 The black line separates the cells with no free gas top from the cell containing free gas bottom the basin scale 5 1 Implications of the integrated stratigraphic and burial thermal modeling workflow The conceptual geological model as described in the literature Gomes et al 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 with shrubstones and spherulitestones present on the paleo-high Mg-rich clay on the paleo flanks and micrite in the basin part was tested with the FSM approach and could be confirmed The FSM simulation results show good calibration in terms of lithology and sequence thickness for the Lower and Upper BVF when compared with well log lithology and sequence thickness data Fig 9 Fig A6 Fig 11 Therefore values such as sediment production lake level curve subsi dence paleobathmetry can be considered calibrated for the time at deposition The sedimentary system changes from a mud dominated system in the Lower BVF to a shallow water dominated system in the Upper BFV which is especially recognizable in the well data from the wells on the flanks of the paleo high Fig 4 To achieve a match of the modeled results with the well data carbonate production curves for the sedi ment types for the Upper BVF needed to be increased by 33 for Mgrich clay 100 for spherulite and 140 for shrub compared to the Lower BVF Deposited thicknesses vary for the Lower BFV between the paleo high and the flanks but are much more homogenous for the Upper BFV Fig 4 In the Upper BVF shrubstones and spherulitestone are also present at the flanks of the paleo high and extend further into the basin Figs 9 and 10 Shrub and spherulite sediment types depend on biological factors for their growth Ceraldi and Green 2017 Gomes et al 2020 A potential change in lake water chemistry or a change in lake currents delivering more nutrients could have led to more favorable growth conditions during the Upper BFV During the Lower BFV several deeper lakes might have existed around the paleo high which merged into a more continuous larger lake during the Upper BVF A larger connected lake could favor the distribution of nutrients Those changes could be related to underlying tectonic origins shown by the presence of unconformities Introducing uncertainty into the model by varying the input pa rameters of the simulation showed a high predictivity of the facies Fig 13 Flow velocity field calculated with TemisFlow at t 112 Myrs along the reference EW vertical cross-section of the pre-salt layers with the lithology distributions of the original model a and the new model b The cross-sections are colored with facies index see Fig 7 the black ellipse focuses on the up ward flow that brings the deep fluids to the upper layers in the new model High structure The basin simulation also provides insight into the filling history of the Pre-Salt field reservoir The CO2 started to form a gas phase between 113 and 112 Myrs during salt deposition while hydrocarbons appear soon after between 112 and 106 Myrs Fig A8 Maximum saturation is reached at 106 Myrs Thereafter we observe a that the CO2 concentra tion decreases slightly in favor of the hydrocarbons 5 Discussion This study investigates the potential outcomes of the interactions between Mg-rich clays host facies and the CO2-rich fluid upwelling and the resulting silicification of lacustrine carbonate reservoir of the BVF at the basin scale While previous studies have extensively explored the implications of the controlling diagenetic processes involved at the well scale Basso et al 2023 Lima de Jesus et al 2023 and at the reservoir scale Almeida Carvalho et al 2024 they have not addressed the predictability of silicification beyond well control at the basin scale To fill this gap we apply a new integrative workflow based on 3D process simulation coupled with quantitative geochemical analysis to understand the silicification probability of the BVF in space and time at 14 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 distribution It shows that the model is robust as there is minor variation in the average percentage of sediment type Mg-rich clay between 7 43 and 14 57 across the study area The result of thickness calibration between the seismic horizon data and the simulation is well achieved in zones with well data around the paleo-high ranging from 13 to 47m Fig A6 Mismatches are localized in the Northwest simulation thickness too thin and the Southeast simulation thickness too thick far away from well data in the basin area Getting a better calibration result in those areas was not without losing the thickness calibration in other parts of the model Sensitivity analysis identified subsidence with a contribution of over 50 as the most influential parameter on the percentage of Mg-rich clay in the model Fig 12 This parameter comes from the seismic horizons a type of data that already has a higher un certainty in the area The BVF is covered by a 2000 2500m thick evaporite layer Chang et al 1990 Dias 1998 Pereira and Macedo 1990 Low contrast rock densities in the formation plus the coverage by thick evaporites complicate seismic interpretation and time-depth con version While the seismic horizons did not affect the primary outcome of this study future work on seismic interpretation and depth-migration in the study area could reduce the uncertainty The workflow used in this study differs from most standard basin analyses by first introducing a preliminary stratigraphic forward modeling stage Fig 2 FSM simulates geological processes through time to reconstruct lithology distribution Coupled with basin modeling it has been shown to reduce uncertainties in petrophysical parameter distributions by better constraining lithofacies Barabasch et al 2019 Christ et al 2016 Dubille et al 2017 The FSM approach provided 8 detailed lithology distribution maps for the pre-salt formations In particular the spatial distribution of Mgrich clays is an essential element for the understanding of the silicifi cation intervals in this part of the Santos Basin Pereira et al 2023 Coupled with the burial and thermal model the probability of silicifi cation can be predicted Mg-rich clays occur predominantly in a ba thymetry window of 20 50m because of the associated carbonate production curve The Mg-rich clay production is supposed to cease with increasing bathymetry as it requires a high pH value of 9 5 At deeper bathymetries elevated methane levels and associated acidity due to organic sediment accumulation is supposed to prevent the formation of Mg-rich clays Tosca and Wright 2014 Therefore the production curve was adapted to follow this trend This production window results in a widespread Mg-rich clay accumulation in the basin but elevated values in proximity to the highs and on the paleo-flanks which offered favorable conditions for accumulation below the wave base Fig 10 With the FSM approach and its validation by means of to the calibration at the well locations average Mg-rich clay content could be calculated at the basin scale FSM results also provided basin-scale spatial distribu tions for other lithologies present in the BVF which constrained the porosity and permeability distributions for the burial thermal model Fig A5 Shrubstones and spherulitestones were assigned a higher permeability increased by a factor of 1000 than micritic and Mg-rich mudstones resulting in a contrast in rock properties Compared to the first-generation burial thermal model a more differentiated flow ve locity field becomes apparent Fig 13 Areas of shrubstones and spherulitestones act as pathways for CO2 migration from deeper layers along faults and along stratigraphic layers forming chimney and tree-like structures Fig 13 The same phenomenon has been observed at the well scale Basso et al 2023 and at the reservoir scale Almeida Carvalho et al 2024 This result highlights the importance of the lithology distribution as one of the key drivers of fluid migration across different observation scales Therefore it is important to include a detailed lithology distribution to correctly predict the silicification probability Around the Pre-Salt field anticline FSM predicts a lithology dominated by shrubstones and spherulitestones Figs 9 10 and 13 These act as conduits for CO2 migration and CO2 can rise to the salt base along which it begins to migrate laterally Fig 14 Where the FSM predicts a predominantly micritic lithology such as north of the Pre-Salt field anticline low per meabilities act as a seal for CO2 migration resulting in high CO2 con centrations being trapped in the pre-salt layers Fig 14 The effect on general hydrodynamics is difficult to measure but is probably of sec ondary importance compared to the role of faults Comparison of the hydrodynamics of the original model with the new model Fig A7 shows that the combined effect of the decrease in permeability in the shale facies and the increase in permeability along faults leads to local differences in CO2 concentration due to flow modifications but the regional trends are preserved 5 2 Quantitative assessment of the dynamics of CO2 migration in the basin Results of this integrated basin modeling workflow not only provided insight into the probability of silicification but also highlighted some interesting features regarding the CO2 system Analysis of the basin simulation results shows that the CO2 can only begin to migrate from the deepest layers when the permeability is sufficient to allow the flow i e in the relatively shallowest parts of the deepest layer Fig 14 In the deepest areas the permeability of the rock is close to the irreducible permeability after salt deposition and is no longer compacting trapping the dissolved and free CO2 in the porosity As the CO2 accumulates over time it forms a gas phase and the overpressure begins to rise but not enough to exceed the capillary pressure of the source rock sitting above the bottom layer Fig A8 Upward migration of CO2 occurs in areas where the basement is shallower making the lowest layers more permeable particularly around the Pre-Salt field anticline and the western compartment of the Outer High lineament where faults were modeled by 10 times more permeable facies Fig 14 These areas of relatively higher permeability provide flow paths for the upward migration of gaseous CO2 by buoy ancy and hydrodynamics generated by the low-salinity and CO2-rich fluids expelled from the deepest layers by compaction Fig 14 As the deepest fluids flow into the upper pre-salt layers they are locally mixed with the fluids in place thus reducing local salinity increasing CO2 solubility and CO2 concentration and ultimately feeding the gaseous phase with CO2 Therefore the uncertainty in predicting the CO2 con centration in the subsalt layer is primarily due to the uncertainty in the sediment thickness which controls the distribution of permeability and rock compactability in the deepest layers and to a lesser extent to the position and permeability of major faults which provide localized flow paths connecting the basement to the upper pre-salt layer The sensi tivity of the distribution of CO2 concentration to the geological scenario is illustrated in Fig A7 where a comparison between the two maps of CO2 concentration predicted with the original with no fault and a basic lithological distribution - and the updated model at 112 Myrs in the presalt layer The two maps show the same trends with local differences notably sharper concentration peaks in the new model such as the concentration peak located at the northeast end of the Pre-Salt field anticline The CO2 production flux map may affect the relative con centration peak at the top of the deepwater inflows but not their loca tion We expect it to play a secondary role in the overall trends of the silicification probability maps obtained in this study This analysis shows that the basin simulation contributes to the workflow mainly by predicting a distribution of the CO2 concentration that is quite robust since it is controlled to the first order by the sediment thickness which shows little uncertainty This conclusion is very specific to the geochemical system considered here where pressure and temperature play only a secondary role The basin simulation also provided insight into the temporal evolu tion of the composition of the non-water phase - including hydrocarbons and CO2 - trapped in the Pre-Salt field reservoir CO2 appeared first but very shortly before hydrocarbons Fig A9 This supports the assump tion that the diagenetic episode was very short in time if the arrival of hydrocarbons stopped the process or that diagenesis continued after the 15 A -B Christ et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 arrival of hydrocarbons possibly with slower kinetics Finally this analysis also showed a slight decrease in the amount of CO2 trapped in the reservoir over time which can be interpreted as a continuous supply of fresh hydrocarbons while the supply of CO2 from the deepest layers has decreased due to reduced compaction and the interruption of CO2 production Our study focusses on an internal source of silica associated to a first phase of silicification and CO2 rich fluid upwelling along deep-rooted faults However there are other possible scenarios regarding silicifica tion For example hydrothermal activity can also be a source of silica and the interplay of burial diagenesis and hydrothermal fluids can lead to the precipitation and dissolution of minerals impacting the reservoir quality in the region De Ros 2021 Dissolution of Mg-rich clays and silicification could also come from maturation of organic matter which can generate CO2 and organic acids which can in turn also dissolve Mg-rich clays Future studies could investigate alternative scenarios regarding the CO2 origin and silica source to calculate silicification probability with our described workflow 5 3 Consequences of the interactions of CO2-fluids and the carbonate host rocks silicification Collard et al 2023 investigated the mechanisms driving the silici fication of continental carbonates using geochemical batch modelling constrained by a large set of samples from the Barra Velha Formation Santos Basin Brazil They evaluated the contribution of different silica sources including the contribution of Mg-rich clay alteration to silici fication and the physicochemical conditions that trigger silicification Their models showed that pH is the first-order parameter controlling the stability of Mg-rich clay pH can be influenced by several processes including local CO2 inputs in sedimentary basins They also showed that the water-to-rock ratio and secondary mineral formation may constrain the dissolution of Mg-rich clay and the precipitation of secondary phases such as quartz dolomite and magnesite by renewing the source of proton more effectively and acting as a sink for Si and Mg which affects the saturation state of the solution The dissolution of carbonates and their cementation or replacement by silica are supposed to be a driving factor on the permeability and porosity High silicification probability can be an indicator for reservoir quality For this reason the understanding of the silicification processes and the modeling of the spatial distribution of silicification probability are of great importance in the characterization of pre-salt carbonates The integrated process-based modeling workflow presented above provided therefore the two essential input data types for the assessment of silicification probability on the Outer High of the Santos Basin Fig 2 FSM simulated the spatial heterogeneity of sedimentary facies notably the Mg-rich clays Basin modeling simulated the temporal evo lution and spatial distribution of controlling factors for silicification notably pressure temperature salinity and CO2 concentration Combining these with the results of process-based geochemical modeling Table 4 Collard et al 2023 allowed the computation of Mg-rich clay transformation probability across the study area Silicification probability maps were calculated for the 8 pre-salt layers Silicification probability appears to be very low in most parts of the Outer High Fig 15 It is higher close to the Pre-Salt field anti cline and in the northeast and southeast parts of the Outer High where the CO2 concentration and Mg-rich clay content reached sufficient levels to dissolve Mg-rich clay and precipitate quartz in the host-rocks In more details medium to high silicification probability is observed in a few small spots situated to the east and at the Pre-Salt field anticline where it peaks at the northern end of the anticline crest Fig 15 These areas coincide with those showing relatively high Mg-rich clay contents Figs 8a and 7 as well as zones of high CO2 concentrations Fig A7 Consequently the produced silicification maps are coherent with the input data and the process-based calculations They point out to those areas and depth intervals where the continental carbonate rocks have Fig 15 Silicification probability map calculated for the Upper Barra Velha Formation pre-salt layer been silicified and affected by inherent dissolution of remaining car bonates resulting in highly porous and permeable pre-salt reservoirs that are produced in the various fields offshore Brazil Quantitative silicification data from the other reservoirs in the study area were not provided so the predicted silicification probability maps cannot be compared with in-situ observations An interesting perspective of this study would be a regional analysis of silicification to evaluate the validity of our prediction 6 Conclusions To better understand and predict reservoir quality in the Barra Velha Formation at the larger basin-scale we focused our work on the spatial and temporal prediction of the silicification probability due to the interaction between CO2-rich fluids and Mg-rich clays For this purpose we have developed an innovative workflow that integrates forward stratigraphic modeling FSM basin thermal modeling and quantitative geochemical modeling FSM simulated with a process-based modeling approach the Mg-rich clay distribution and associated uncertainties at the time of deposition of the Barra Velha Formation Basin modeling simulated the factors that control the diagenetic reactions responsible for silicification over time namely the CO2 flow salinity thermody namic conditions and fluid composition Geochemical modeling allowed calculation of the Mg-rich clay transformation ratio to silica The combination of Mg-rich clay distribution diagenetic control factors and chemical kinetics allowed the calculation of silicification probabil ity maps This study explored the scenario of an internal silica source and transformation of Mg-rich clays by CO2-rich waters which are expelled from the deepest parts of the Santos Basin via a deep-rooted fault system The highest probability of silicification was observed at the northeastern end of the Pre-Salt field anticline Other high silicification probabilities were identified above the Outer-High lineament and to a lesser extent in the northeast of the study area With respect to reservoir quality it is essential to understand not 16 Marine and Petroleum Geology 180 2025 107455 A -B Christ et al only the silicification process but also the dissolution of the matrix and replacement with dolomite at both the well and basin scales An inte grated process-based modeling workflow as demonstrated in this study coupled with geochemical modeling that also focuses on dissolution and dolomitization could help in understanding reservoir quality Aslanian D Moulin M

basement structure within the Santos Basin offshore Brazil in which all of the elements of the pre-salt hydrocarbon play are present Following a clastic-dominated early synrift phase the later synrift and sag phases are characterized by an extensive non-marine carbonate platform over the basement high The study area within this new 3D seismic dataset contains carbonates stratigraphically equivalent to the reservoirs within the Lula and Sapinhoa fields Analysis of the 3D seismic data shows that the pre-salt carbonates onlap the basement of the Sugar Loaf High and form aggradational geometries on a platform that has a proximal to distal width of about 100 km and an interpreted relief of some 900 m The carbonate platform has an aggradational and mounded basinward-facing gullied margin with slope deposits Progradational units are imaged on the platform top that may be either carbonate or clastic in composition The platform is preserved beneath evaporites that form the regional seal within the Santos Basin Platforms of this size are previously unknown from lacustrine settings outside the pre-salt stratigraphy of the Santos and Campos Basins Brazil The global importance of the pre-salt hydrocarbon play in the Santos Basin offshore Brazil Fig 1 has been apparent since the discovery of the multibillion barrel Lula oil field in 2006 This was followed by a series of additional discoveries including the Ju piter Carcara Iara Libra Franco and Sapinhoa fields Fig 2 which together were producing more than 500 000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in June 2014 Formigli 2014 This remarkable success is a result of the presence of a world-class source rock a porous and permeable carbonate reservoir and a multitude of traps beneath a thick laterally extensive evaporite seal However there have been some disappointing well results mainly related to heterogeneity in the non-marine carbonate reservoir Prediction of carbonate reservoir quality is therefore the principal uncertainty within this play Drilling wells in this ultra-deepwater environment often through more than 1 5 km of salt is hugely expensive and technically challenging Thus the ability to accurately predict reservoir quality ahead of drilling is of particular importance The need for predictive models of reservoir quality is further emphasized by ambitious drilling programmes such as the 22 new wells anticipated by Petrobras in 2014 Busquet 2014 As a result considerable academic interest and industry investment has been focused on understanding the sedimentation precipitation and preservation of non-marine carbonates The hunt for outcrop scale analogues as well as the interpretation of nano-scale biotic and abiotic fabrics has received more interest since 2006 than ever before The Outer High of the Santos Basin Figs 1 2 is host to many significant pre-salt discoveries The currently producing Lula field is estimated to have 5 8 billion barrels of oil in place Energy Information Administration 2014 and occurs in the north of this feature This paper presents new 3D seismic data from the Sugar Loaf High Fig 2 which is located south of the Lula field and comprises most of the areal extent of the Outer High The aim of the paper is to examine and interpret the seismic stratigraphy in order to further our understanding of what has been reported to be an unusual

basinward-facing escarpment margin with aggradational and progradational stratigraphic geometries similar to features that up until now have only been described from marine carbonate platforms Geological setting The Santos Basin covers an area of approximately 350 000 km2 extending from the coastal ranges of the Serra do Mar to the outer limits of the Sa o Paulo Plateau The basin is a complex area of stretched continental crust and volcanics Scotchman et al 2010 Gomes et al 2013 that forms a structural high on the outer margin of the basin The Santos Basin is separated from the

major feature in the South Atlantic delineating the southern margin of the South Atlantic salt basin Scotchman et al 2010 The Santos Basin contains a greater extent of thick evaporite deposits than the Campos Basin to the north Davison 2007 The evaporite sequence is of fundamental importance to the active petroleum system not only in terms of providing a regional seal the thermal conductivity of the evaporites reduces the temperature of the deeply buried pre-salt section preventing overmaturity of the source rock Exploration in the pre-salt section of the Santos Basin has centred on the Sa o Paulo Plateau Fig 1 In particular exploration and production focus on the Outer High Figs 1 2 which is also referred to as the Santos External High Carminatti et al 2008 Gomes et al 2013 or the Alto Externo Mohriak et al 2009 This basement high is defined by mapping a regionally correlatable seismic horizon that corresponds to the unconformity at the base of the evaporite sequence which largely reflects Aptian palaeotopography Gomes et al 2013 The Sa o Paulo Plateau is believed to result from failed attempts to propagate seafloor spreading north of the Florianopolis Fracture Zone evidenced by the interpreted presence of proto-oceanic crust in the southern part of the Santos Basin west of the southern part of the Sa o Paulo Plateau Scotchman et al 2010 Gomes et al 2013 Subsequent initiation of seafloor spreading further to the east left the Sa o Paolo Plateau as a segment of thinned continental crust still attached to the South American margin The Outer High of the Santos Basin is an uplifted basement structure that records a transition from early volcaniclastic deposition to almost continuous carbonate deposition during the Barremian and Aptian It also marks a period of thermal subsidence or sag during the transition from rift to drift tectonics as seafloor spreading commenced in the mid-Atlantic Liro Dawson 2000 The distal location and pronounced elevation of the Outer High resulted in a clastic-starved environment in which carbonate deposition could flourish Moreira et al 2007 Gomes et al 2013 The older carbonates in the pre-salt section are highly fossiliferous lacustrine limestones with abundant coquina beds similar in part to those described from the neighbouring Campos Basin Carvalho et al 2000 Muniz Bosence this volume in press The sag phase deposits are interpreted to have formed in a non-marine depositional environment of increasing salinity although the exact mechanisms involved in their formation are debated Rezende Pope 2015 Wright Barnett 2015 Subsequently an increasingly saline lacustrine environment developed culminating in the deposition of the overlying Albian evaporite sequence Davison 2007 The exclusively continental or shallow-water deposits found within the rift and sag intervals suggest that the sediment surface level and base level were similar throughout the Barremian and Aptian Quirk et al 2012 Dataset and study area The new data for this paper comes from the Sugar Loaf High SLH c 13 500 km2 the larger of the two large culminations that form the Outer High Fig 2 The adjacent Tupi High covers an area of c 3700 km2 and is host to the Lula oil field To the east a series of basement-cored rotated faultblocks form a series of smaller structures including the Jupiter Peroba and Pau Brasil highs

in Gomes et al 2013 and Mann Rigg 2012 However the region is now covered by 42 000 km2 of 3D seismic data Fig 2 allowing for an interpretation of the regional-scale structure as well as enabling the interpretation of an array of different seismic facies within the uppermost carbonate sequences The data taken from the Cluster 3D and Cluster Extension 3D surveys over the Outer High Fig 2 comprise 3D PSDM seismic data processed using CBM Kirchhoff and Reverse Time Migration algorithms No well data are presented Structural evolution Rifting in the Santos Basin is postulated to have occurred in at least two phases Kusznir Karner 2007 propose Berriasian early Barremian c 145 126 Ma and late Barremian Aptian c 125 112 Ma stages The early and late phases of rifting and the overlying sag sequence can all be recognized by distinct unconformity-bounded packages on seismic data studied for this paper Fig 3 Another unconformity marks the transition from sag sequence carbonates into evaporites The basement is composed of folded metamorphosed sedimentary successions and sheared Precambrian rocks with significant intrusive rocks of Archean and Proterozoic age This mobile belt basement forms in a weaker lower crust compared with cratonic areas to the north and results in a wider greatly extended rifted margin in the Campos and Santos Basins Brune et al 2014 The basement

the orientation of this ENE WSW Precambrian fabric contrasts with the east west orientation of extension during the Mesozoic Meisling et al 2001 resulting in oblique rifting of the margin The synrift period is characterized by basement involved normal faulting accommodating the regional mechanical subsidence related to continental breakup Karner 2000 The first stage of rifting corresponds to a period of volcanism growth faulting and subsequent sedimentary infill of the newly formed sedimentary basin Figs 3 4 This phase is characterized by synthetic and antithetic faults across the Santos Basin with variation in the thicknesses of sedimentary packages across the Outer High suggesting that the structures on the SLH began to form at this time A thick wedge of sediment can be seen basinward of the bounding master fault of the SLH Fig 5a in addition to the uplift and rotation of the downthrown fault block This creates a series of smaller basement-cored structural highs to the east of the SLH such as the Peroba High Fig 2 The geometries observed in the hanging wall growth wedge Fig 5a suggest that uplift of the SLH probably began during the synrift phase the growth wedge also shows that the relative subsidence of the hanging wall continued during the thermal subsidence phase On the SLH itself the upper synrift deposits of the Barra Velha Fm tend to show a less prominent wedging geometry than the lower synrift Fig 4 This may represent differences in the rate of fault movement that consequently created accommodation space it may also signify an increase in the rate of sedimentation in the latter stages of synrift carbonate accumulation Faulting on the SLH consists of both synthetic and antithetic faulting relative to the eastern master fault hinge zone whereas the Tupi sub-high to the north is segmented only by synthetic faults Gomes et al 2009 The Santos Basin passive margin experienced intrusive and extrusive volcanism during the rift and drift phases Igneous activity is thought to have taken place in three phases from the Barremian through to the Aptian 137 131 Ma Camboriu Fm Fig 3 120 119 Ma and 115 110 Moreira et al 2007 Scotchman et al 2010 The rifting of the southernmost part of the South America plate is associated with the extrusion of flood basalts in the onshore Parana Campos and Santos Basins Cainelli Mohriak 1999 The margin then enters a transitional phase or po s-rifte Moreira et al 2007 after rifting but before the drift phase It is during this transitional phase that two of the most important lithologies within the hydrocarbon system are deposited the non-marine carbonate reservoirs of the Barra Velha Fm the Sag Sequence of Carminatti et al 2009 and the thick overlying evaporite seal of the Ariri Fm Fig 3 These two sequences are separated by a regional unconformity that can be mapped at the base of the salt Karner Gamboa 2007 The Santos Basin is the widest salt basin in the South Atlantic and the Outer High is estimated to have been at least 200 km away from both the African and the Brazilian hinge lines before continental breakup Gomes et al 2013 The anomalous width of the salt basin here may be the result of a ridge jump event early in its evolution Szatmari et al 1996 The arid Aptian climate resulted in a series of elongated salt basins separated along the margin by igneous intrusions and volcanic massifs Mohriak et al 2008 The periodic influx of continental and marine waters into the basin resulted in the deposition of an evaporite sequence at least 1 km thick possibly reaching 2 km in the main salt depocentres created by thermal subsidence Szatmari et al 1996 Davison 2007 Salt flowed basinward on a massive scale in the 10 myr following deposition as the basin tilted towards the east resulting in virtually zero thicknesses along the inner basin margin and an inflated 2000 4000 m on the outer margins In the case of the Santos Basin the Florianopolis High Fig 1 isolates the basin from the fully marine waters of the Pelotas Basin to the south resulting in a very different evolutionary history However the structural and stratigraphic history of the Campos Basin in the north has similarities to that of the Santos Basin Mohriak Fainstein 2012 even though the Santos Basin is around three times larger and has twice as much stretched continental crust as the Campos Basin The transitional phase is also thought to represent the period in which the Santos External High was uplifted relative to the rest of the basin Gomes et al 2009 The volcanic-floored sub-basins of the Outer High represent a period of seafloor spreading that was aborted early in its development the abandonment of this tectono-magmatic process ultimately led to the uplift of the Sa o Paulo Plateau The severely stretched continental crust is interpreted to have been far less dense than the surrounding volcanic crust resulting in isostatic uplift Gomes et al 2009 2013 Drift tectonics have been prevalent on the Brazilian passive margin since the end of the transitional phase The initiation of the drift phase is marked by the cessation of rifting and the commencement of oceanic crust accretion in the mid-Atlantic at around 110 112 Ma Moreira et al 2007 Scotchman et al 2010 The Outer High has remained a positive feature throughout its long tectonic history impacting the

many similarities in their stratigraphic evolution basement highs in each case provide the elevated topography upon which carbonate sediments accumulated These highs were located in a distal setting in the basin thereby providing isolation from external clastic input and favouring the accumulation of carbonate sediments The metamorphic basement is overlain by Valanginian Hauterivian basalts of the Camboriu Formation Moreira et al 2007 which formed part of the Parana volcanic province The basalt sequence is estimated to be at least 400 m thick Quirk et al 2012 Volcanism was extensive during

April 27 2015 J P BUCKLEY ET AL The Camboriu Fm basalts and associated volcaniclastics mark a distinctive change in reflector type at the base of the synrift sequence on the seismic data Fig 3 The synrift deposits occur as two packages reflecting two phases of rifting separated by an unconformity surface Fig 3 This unconformity is thought to be equivalent to the Pre-Alagoas unconformity of Wright Barnett 2015 The lower synrift packages show wedging geometries in the hanging walls of the high-frequency extensional faults across the SLH Figs 3 4 These deposits are recorded as fluvio-lacustrine sandstones conglomerates and playa mudstones of the Pic arras and Itapema Formations and also as containing some extrusive volcanics Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2009 The upper part of the synrift is a carbonatedominated sequence Barra Velha Fm made up of a variety of lithologies including a world-class source rock equivalent to the Lagoa Feia Gp of the Campos Basin and fossiliferous molluscan-rich coquina facies which also form a prolific reservoir in the Campos Basin Carvalho et al 2000 This unit is interpreted to have formed in a lacustrine environment Carminatti et al 2009 The synrift and the overlying sag sequence are expressed on seismic by the evolution to tectonic quiescence during the sag phase Figs 3 4 The base of sag unconformity probably equates to the Intra-Alagoas unconformity of Wright Barnett 2015 Most of the extensional faulting on the SLH terminates at the base of sag unconformity and the growth wedges seen in the synrift are largely absent within the sag sequence The sag phase carbonates record a variety of different seismic facies the most common configuration is for the sag sequence to onlap infill and drape the antecedent rift topography Figs 3 4 Aggradational build-ups and progradational clinoforms are also present and are discussed in detail below The sag succession is thought to have been deposited over a period of around 7 myr Karner Gamboa 2007 The upper part of the Barra Velha Fm passes from lacustrine coquina limestones into a microbialite chemically precipitated non-marine carbonate succession Wright Barnett 2015 The absence of unambiguous palaeoecologically significant fossils together with the presence of the mineral stevensite rather than marine-derived evaporites sulphates and chlorides indicates an alkaline lacustrine setting with a volcanic source area Wright Barnett 2015 The Barra Velha Fm exceeds 500 m in thickness and together with the underlying Itapema and Pic arras Formations comprises some 4200 m of section Wright Barnett 2015 Seismic stratigraphy of the SLH Sag sequence The oldest interface interpreted from the seismic data is that between the basement and the base of the synrift this is typically a peak reflector SEG Normal which represents an increase in acoustic impedance as the lithology changes from basal clastic synrift infill to the underlying volcanics of the Camboriu Formation Figs 3 4 The lower and upper synrift units are separated by a variably developed unconformity Fig 3 This can be a very subtle feature to interpret on the seismic data The lower synrift fill tends to be thicker than that of the upper synrift with more steeply dipping and wedging geometries Another unconformity separates the upper synrift from the sag sequence which was deposited in the largely quiescent transitional phase between rift and drift tectonics The reflectors within this package are largely unfaulted parallel low angle dip and commonly onlap the unconformity surface Figs 3 5 The sag sequence records a series of seismic features that help to build a regional picture of structural evolution and sedimentation in the basin These are discussed in more detail in the following section The thickness of the sag sequence is strongly influenced by the different depositional environments on the high which appear to be primarily dictated by proximity to the base level of lacustrine waters The interplay between deposition and erosion as well as the potential for an influx of locally-derived detrital sediment make for a series of complex relationships across the SLH As can be seen in Figure 4 the sag sequence is not present over all of the SLH This is also evident in previously published images of the Lula field Carminatti et al 2009 Scotchman et al 2010 where the sag sequence can be seen to thin and onlap tilted basement fault-blocks that subcrop the base evaporite unconformity The extent of the sag sequence on the crest of the SLH appears to relate to both erosional and depositional factors although isolating their relative importance is difficult Truncated reflectors at the top of the sag sequence suggest that initial deposition over most of the SLH was followed by erosion of the higher topography as base level fell The very uppermost areas may have been sites of non-deposition although there is no conclusive evidence to suggest that non-deposition was more or less likely than deposition followed by erosion The dominant lithologies of the crestal area of the SLH are most likely a combination of exposed uplifted basement and early synrift deposits Downdip from the crest of the high in addition to the Downloaded from http sp lyellcollection org by guest on April 27 2015 PRE-SALT CARBONATES OF THE SANTOS BASIN onlapping and draping architecture of the sag sequence is a Terminal Horst Platform with an eastward-facing escarpment margin and an area with prograding clinoforms which are both described in detail below The base evaporite reflectors onlap and infill the gullies between the reflectors The overall bathymetric relief of this margin on the footwall to the bounding fault is approximately 900 m and the maximum angle of slope varies from 16 to 218 Terminal Horst Platform Discussion One of the most prominent features seen within the sag sequence is an aggradational flat-topped area with a series of build-ups located on the eastern margin of the SLH Figs 4 5 This is labelled the Terminal Horst Platform and its eastern margin marks the break of slope where the Sa o Paulo Plateau meets the deeper basin The platform overlies a relatively thin synrift package compared with the thickened synrift sequences in the adjacent half-graben Fig 5a This implies a positive structure for the Terminal Horst Platform during synrift deposition The platform is a north south elongate flat-topped structure that extends for 65 km along the margin of the SLH and is about 10 km wide west east Fig 6 The northern and southern ends of the platform are not seen in the study area The west east section Fig 5a indicates a preserved mounded margin and slope that originated in the upper synrift and shows aggradational stacking with some backstepping of the margin through the sag sequence to the base evaporites unconformity A prominent feature of the platform is the serrated eastward or basinward facing margin The serrations are a series of promontories with intervening gullies spaced at between 5 and 12 km apart Figs 5b 6 The promontories vary in planview shape from short 15 km transverse ridges parallel to the margin to triangular projections to elongate promontories extending eastward out into the basin Figs 5b 6 Downslope they pass into areas with either rough or smooth relief In cross-section the promontories are typically around 300 m in height with a variable lateral extent ranging from 2 to 5 km Figs 5b 6a Their cross-sectional morphology varies from sharp and angular peaks with a steep relief to more rounded gentler peaks The internal reflectors of the promontories appear to be aggradational with an essentially flat basal reflector at the base of the sag unit that evolves vertically into convex-up reflectors that eventually conform to the final surface of the promontories Figs 5b 6a While lateral truncation of some of the reflectors could be interpreted the majority of the promontories are interpreted as aggradational constructions or build-ups Subsequent erosion of the margins of these features to create gullies Figs 5b 6 may also be interpreted As these structures have not been drilled and we are unaware of other such features being described from the South Atlantic basins all possible interpretations need to be explored The seismic data indicate that the promontories are layered so it has been considered that they could comprise siliciclastic evaporite or carbonate sediments or volcanic strata Although in longitudinal section the promontories have similar aggradationally stacked reflectors to volcanoes e g Burgess et al 2013 the morphology of the entire margin with its flat top and serrated edge does not conform to a volcanic edifice Siliciclastic strata fill lows rather than build promontories if the strata were siliciclastic and the serrated margin and entire escarpment were purely erosional the internal reflectors of the promontories would parallel the base sag unconformity Crosssections show this not to be the case instead they indicate aggradational reflector geometries Evaporites possibly in the form of diapiric structures can also be discounted as the seismic character of the sag sequence is quite different from that of the overlying evaporites that have been proven from drilling Carminatti et al 2009 A carbonate origin seems more likely and is consistent with the knowledge that the late synrift of the Barra Valha Fm of the Santos Basin largely comprises carbonate lithologies Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2009 Terra et al 2009 10 It is further supported by the correlation on regional seismic lines of the sag phase unit from the drilled carbonates of the Lula field to the equivalent unit on the SLH Gomes et al 2013 Carbonate platforms commonly form nearvertical or escarpment margins to a flat-topped structure in marine environments James Ginsburg 1979 Read 1985 The promontories have many of the features of the morphology internal structure and relationship to overlying strata that are characteristics of carbonate build-ups as opposed to other structures Burgess et al 2013 Similar serrated margins are present on the east facing margin of the Tupi sub-high and the smaller Peroba High Figs 2 6b c this morphology is not evident on any of the west-facing slopes in this dataset Thus it would appear that the east-facing slopes are the sites of preferential aggradation on each of the platforms These aggradational structures are seen to manifest as mounded

synrift on the footwall of the eastern bounding fault to the Terminal Horst but then backsteps and finally aggrades to its current position Therefore although the mounds appear initially to be located close to the fault for most of its history the mounded margin backsteps westward away from the fault so that the aggradational constructions seen on the sub-salt surface Fig 6a are about 5 km to the west of the eastern fault Downslope of the serrated margin are a series of what are interpreted as mass failure scars Fig 6a The dip section of the base of slope shows a thicker sag-age sequence as well as large-scale debris Downloaded from http sp lyellcollection org by guest on April 27 2015 PRE-SALT CARBONATES OF THE SANTOS BASIN flow morphologies that suggest a collapse of the escarpment margin These are frequently seen along the slope in our dataset about 65 km The eroded slopes of the eastern margins of the platforms tend to have a much steeper relief than the corresponding west-facing slopes which may have encouraged the erosional processes affecting any unstable slope facies It should be noted that the areas of exposed basement lithology on the eastern margin south of the Terminal Horst do not show this serrated style It therefore seems likely that these features are lithology dependent and potentially result from the gravitational collapse of partially lithified carbonate material that formed the mounded facies on the eastern margin of the platform This basinward facing margin of the SLH shows many similarities to the gullied margins of marine carbonate platforms such as Great Bahama Bank Mulder et al 2012 and the Miocene Luconia platforms offshore NW Borneo Vahrenkamp et al 2004 The similarity of the serrated morphology of the margin in these marine and non-marine environments suggests that there may be a common process The combination of enhanced rates of localized accumulation oversteepening and the subsequent downslope collapse that takes place on the margins of modern carbonate platforms may explain the apparent truncations on the edges of the promontories Prograding clinoforms Directly downslope of the exposed basement at the crest of the eastern end of the SLH are a series of prograding clinoforms The clinoforms are best developed on the southern margin of a structural depression c 10 km across to the west of the escarpment margin to the Terminal Horst Platform Fig 7a The clinoforms prograde to the north and NE into this depression and typically extend for around 10 km from its southern margin reaching thicknesses of 450 m Fig 7b The clinoforms partially fill the depression and die out into what is interpreted as a deeper-water lacustrine area to the north The best examples of the clinoforms are located on the southern margin of the depression and thicknesses and extent decrease to the north along the western margin of the depression There are limited examples of clinoforms visible to the west of the ridge that bounds the northern section of the depression which are insignificant in thickness and extent in comparison The clinoforms have a concave-up profile and an average maximum angle of slope of 138 They record several fluctuations in base-level with phases of onlap and aggradation visible within the overall progradational sequence Fig 7b Thus base-level occasionally rose during the longer period of still-stand or fall when clinoform progradation occurred Following the progradation base-level was lowered further resulting in desiccation and evaporite accumulation Discussion The lithology of the clinoforms cannot be determined on seismic data alone Regional data indicate that the sag sequence is carbonate-dominated in this area Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2009 Gomes et al 2013 However the location of the clinoforms adjacent to exposed basement and eroded synrift section suggests that they could be of clastic detrital carbonate or lacustrine carbonate composition Their maximum observed angle of slope could have developed in any of these lithologies and is not diagnostic Different hypotheses are explored below The crestal area of the SLH covers an area of around 2000 km2 with basement and truncated synrift packages being the dominant lithologies subcropping the base evaporite unconformity Fig 4 Extensional faulting across the high created a series of rift shoulders that could have focused sediment transport from the updip highs in the south towards the structural lows downdip to the north Fig 7a This is consistent with the thicker and more extensive clinoforms that can be seen here on the seismic data The western margin of the depression has a significantly smaller updip sediment source area than the southern margin which may explain why the clinoforms are less developed there If detrital input to the system was dominant instead of carbonate accumulation the clinoforms here may represent the formation of an alluvial fan or a delta depositing clastics at or near the margin of the palaeo-depression One of the key problems in attempting to validate this hypothesis is that whilst synrift reflectors can be seen to truncate at the base of the evaporites the basement is virtually characterless on seismic and therefore any contribution of detrital basement clastic sediment cannot be quantified via mass balance calculations The erosional truncation of synrift reflectors in close proximity to the crest of the high means that there is potential for a mixed clastic carbonate sequence being redeposited downslope However whether carbonates here have been subject to erosion as opposed to non-deposition is difficult to determine the carbonate sequences can be seen to onlap the tilted and uplifted basement in the areas of lower topography with the upper limit of depositional onlap unclear The seismic data suggest that there was at least some clastic input from the large Downloaded from http sp lyellcollection org by guest on

strata are early synrift lithologies a significant volume of lower synrift clastics would have entered the system in addition to the carbonate-dominated upper synrift Whether this clastic input from the lower synrift in addition to possible contributions from the exposed basement was significant enough to overwhelm carbonate accumulation downslope is not resolvable from seismic data alone Large volumes of sag phase material from the SLH are visible in the basin beyond the eastern hinge zone suggesting that a significant amount of erosion and redeposition was taking place along this margin

and Terminal Horst carbonate platform within sag phase of SLH Sketch shows final stratigraphy of sag sequence and interpreted former base level of the north south-trending rift shoulders may have meant that clastic-dominated deposition was confined to a relatively small area on the margin of the structural depression on the SLH Alternatively if there was minimal clastic input from the crest of the SLH then the clinoforms could be composed of carbonate material This material may have been derived from an upslope area of shallow carbonate production that was subsequently eroded or be essentially in situ accumulations of lacustrine carbonates on a prograding lake margin The clinoforms represent an excess of supply over accommodation and progradation to fill in the structural lows on the platform The downstepping architecture of the clinoforms and their updip erosion suggests they have formed during a phase of reducing accommodation with phases of base-level rise but overall they conform to a forced regression or falling stage systems tract However these features are known in both clastic and carbonate systems Hunt Tucker 1992 Conclusions Tectonic setting The Lower Cretaceous pre-salt stratigraphy of the portion of the SLH described in this paper appears to be similar to that described elsewhere for the Santos Basin e g Carminatti et al 2009 Unconformably overlying the basement is a synrift unit characterized by strata that wedge into numerous half-graben These relate to a phase of east west extension and both synthetic and antithetic faults are seen From regional data the early synrift unit could be volcanic clastic or carbonate in lithology In the study area no seismic facies indicating early synrift carbonates have been identified and the deposits appear to fill the lows in the style of clastic sediment accumulation The literature proposes e g Moreira et al 2007 that the early synrift is overlain by an increasingly carbonate-dominated late synrift section which is perhaps evidenced by much lower-angle wedging above the intrasynrift unconformity The synrift examined in this study is overlain by a sag sequence which onlaps drapes and infills accommodation space but also shows aggradational geometries typical of carbonate deposits From regional data this unit is reported as mainly comprising lacustrine carbonates Carminatti et al 2009 Terra et al 2009 10 Gomes et al 2013 and this lithology is interpreted in this study from the seismic geometries observed see below The SLH has a steeper faulted eastern basinward margin separated by a synrift half-graben from the fault-bound Peroba High that also has synrift and sag phase deposits Reduced fault movement is recorded in the sag phase strata as clinoforms infill a fault-bound north south trough within the platform top As rifting decreased during which time continental sediments volcanics and latterly carbonates accumulated the high underwent prolonged thermal subsidence During this phase the SLH formed an isolated high in a very extensive lacustrine system and formed the substrate for the development of a large carbonate platform Lacustrine carbonate platform The interpreted accumulation of carbonate strata on and around the SLH described in this work has many of the morphological characteristics of carbonate platforms developed in marine environments namely a flat-topped structure a distinct margin with localized aggradational build-ups and a steep slope with some erosional scars and redeposited sediment Fig 8 The scale of the structure is also similar to that encompassed by its marine counterparts The SLH has a proximal to distal width of some 100 km extends along-strike for over 200 km and has an interpreted relief of some 900 m Such a structure is unknown in the literature from other ancient or modern lacustrine systems Downloaded from http sp lyellcollection org by guest on April 27 2015 J P BUCKLEY ET AL but is

accumulation of insitu build-ups lake margin bioherms biostromes shallow lake floor bioherms biostromes and spring fed thermal or groundwater build-ups Wright 2012 Della Porta 2015 The aggradational buildups interpreted in this study on the eastern margin of the SLH platform could either be subaqueous mounds bioherms preferentially located on the footwall scarp of the SLH or spring-fed hydrothermal build-ups originating above the fault-bound eastern margin The latter interpretation is not supported by the seismic data as most of the marginal build-ups are not sited over visible faults The build-ups arise from flat-lying reflectors and are some 5 km from the eastern block-bounding fault The build-ups are therefore more akin to sedimentary mounds bioherms cf Baskin et al 2015

in the exploration of the lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the Brazilian and African marginal basins More than half of Brazilian oil production originates from the Pre-Salt reservoirs of these offshore basins A study integrating systematic petrography cathodoluminescence scanning electron microscopy microprobe and X-ray diffraction was performed on seven wells in the northern Campos Basin This study highlights the major primary diagenetic and hydrothermal features of the Pre-Salt succession with the aim to improve our understanding of the factors that in uence the porosity and permeability distribution in these important lacustrine carbonate reservoirs The Pre-Salt deposits correspond to bioclastic grainstones and rudstones syngenetic crusts of fascicular calcite and intraclastic grainstones and rudstones of reworked crust fragments and calcite spherulites Magnesian silicates are frequently associated with carbonate deposits In the sag phase stevensitic laminations constitute the substrate for the precipitation of calcite crusts and spherulites which displace and replace the syngenetic magnesian clay deposits In the rift section stevensitic ooids are mixed with bioclasts or form ooidal arenites Pre-Salt carbonate reservoirs have undergone a complex and heterogeneous diagenetic evolution Eodiagenetic processes include the dissolution neomorphism and cementation of bivalve bioclasts in the rift as well as the dissolution of magnesian silicates and their replacement by calcite spherulites silica and dolomite in the sag section Burial alterations are commonly associated with hydrothermal uids carried through faults and fracture systems These uids promote dolomitization silici cation and dissolution at varying degrees and

precipitation in these deposits was related to variations in the pH Mg and Ca activity temperature and pCO2 in the geochemistry of lacustrine waters Wright and Tosca 2016 presented an evaporitic geochemical model to explain the unusual calcite morphologies observed in these cyclothems Alternatively the spherulites were interpreted as ooid-like particles formed by nucleation on the

of complex physicochemical processes on pre-existing rocks which is related to interactions with hot uids promoting the precipitation of unusual cements including saddle dolomite uorite barite anhydrite sphalerite and pyrite Neilson and Oxtoby 2008 Hydrothermal processes are evidence for a local geothermal anomaly and require a mechanism or conduit that allows uid ow such as deep-buried

respectively The objective of this study is to characterize and interpret the depositional diagenetic and hydrothermal conditions under which the Pre-Salt reservoirs from the northern Campos Basin were generated and modi ed This study will contribute to the development of more realistic reservoir models Speci c aims involve the characterization of processes and products of probable hydrothermal circulation throughout faults and fractures as well as their impact on the porosity permeability and heterogeneity of the reservoirs 2 Geological context The Campos Basin is located on the southeastern Brazilian margin approximately between the 21st and 23nd south parallels Fig 1 It covers a total area of approximately 100 000 km2 with only 5800 km2 onshore The study area is located in the northern Campos Basin Fig 1 in deep to ultra-deep waters The basin originated from rifting of the Gondwana Continent during the Neocomian lowermost Cretaceous which eventually formed the South Atlantic Ocean through separation of the American and African continents e g Rabinowitz and LaBrecque 1979 Austin and Uchupi 1982 N rnberg and M ller 1991 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 It is aligned with the Kwanza Basin on the African side Winter et al 2007 divided the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of the Campos Basin into rift post-rift and drift supersequences The rift supersequence was generated during the initial evolution of the basin and is represented by both the volcanic Cabi nas Formation and the basal interval of the Lagoa Feia Group which corresponds to the Itabapoana Atafona and Coqueiros Formations deposited from the Barremian to the Lower Aptian Fig 2 According to McKenzie 1978 and White and McKenzie 1988 the rift phase of the basin which extended from the Hauterivian to the Aptian was determined by the extension of the lithosphere and by the asthenospheric elevation related to widespread intracratonic tholeiitic volcanism Turner et al 1994 Mohriak et al 2008 Torsvik et al 2009 The basal rift section portion of the Lagoa Feia Group is limited at the top by the so-called Pre-Alagoas regional unconformity The Itabapoana Formation is composed of proximal marginal sediments including conglomerates sandstones siltstones and red shales whereas the Atafona Formation mostly comprises arenites and siltstones constituted by ooids of stevensite kerolite and other syngenetic magnesian layer silicates that accumulated in alkaline lakes Bertani and Carozzi 1985a 1985b Dias et al 1988 Abrah o and Warme 1990 The Coqueiros Formation consists of mainly carbonate rudstones and grainstones of ostracod gastropod and mostly bivalve bioclasts intercalated with organic shales e g Baumgarten et al 1988 Dias et al 1988 Thompson et al 2015 Models proposed for the depositional environment of these rift bioclastic deposits have related these deposits to playa-lake and pluvial-lake environments Bertani and Carozzi 1985a storm events bioaccumulated banks and deep lacustrine environments Carvalho et al 2000 and gravitational re-deposition from shallow to deeper lacustrine settings Goldberg et al 2017 The post-rift supersequence which contains the upper interval of the Lagoa Feia Group was deposited on the regional Pre-Alagoas unconformity during the so-called sag stage of the basin This supersequence comprises the Itabapoana Garga Macabu and Retiro Formations that were deposited during the Middle Upper Aptian Fig 2 The Garga Formation comprises sandstones mudrocks and carbonates deposited in a lacustrine environment which grade laterally to the proximal clastic sediments of the Itabapoana Formation Winter et al 2007 The Macabu Formation was deposited in alkaline lacustrine environments under arid climate conditions and comprises argillaceous and carbonate laminites spherulitic carbonate deposits and crusts which were originally interpreted as microbial stromatolites Dias 2005 Muniz and Bosence 2015 These deposits have been re-interpreted as chemical precipitates controlled by the geochemistry of lacustrine waters e g Tosca and Wright 2014 Wright and Barnett 2014 2015 Wright and Tosca 2016 A hybrid biotic abiotic precipitation probably occurs in the Pre-Salt deposits However the abiotic chemical is the dominant control in the precipitation of the majority of the constituents as evidenced by features that were observed in the petrographic study The upper portion of the post-rift supersequence corresponds to the Retiro Formation Fig 2 which is a thick accumulation of evaporites Upper Alagoas This sequence was deposited during the advent of marine incursions under arid climate conditions Leyden et al 1976 Winter et al 2007 and consists essentially of anhydrite halite sylvite and carnallite These evaporites provide a stratigraphic seal for the large hydrocarbon accumulations of the Pre-Salt petroleum province 3 Materials and methods For this study samples from seven wells comprising four cores 358 core plugs and

Although previous works on the pre-salt reservoirs have acknowl edged the presence of reworked deposits in the Barra Velha Formation geological modeling efforts have primarily focused on the in situ facies given their complexity and the absence of a suitable analog Recent studies have emerged specifically examining the origin of reworked deposits Barnett et al 2018 2021 However the interpretation of depositional characteristics structural and stratigraphic evolution and the conceptual model of deposition across different scales remains largely unexplored Understanding the origin and distribution of reworked deposits within a reservoir is of utmost importance as they can result from diverse depositional settings giving rise to distinct textural fabrics that influ ence petrophysical characteristics and ultimately impact reservoir quality In lacustrine systems facies variations are associated with fac tors such as lake depth water chemistry shoreline morphology and fetch Platt and Wright 1991 McGlue et al 2010 Nutz et al 2018 which control the energy regime of the environment and determine the occurrence of reworked deposits Furthermore the occurrence of faults can induce the formation of reworked sediments adding more complexity to the system The carbonates of the BVF were deposited during the transition from the rift to the sag phase leading to notable fluctuations in lake morphology and water levels resulting in distinct facies associations and lateral distribution within the basin Minzoni et al 2020 In this context our study proposes an integrated approach that combines in terpretations derived from seismic data borehole image logs core samples and thin sections to investigate the key characteristics and evidence of reworked facies in a pre-salt field within the Santos Basin The primary objective is to elucidate the nature of these reworked de posits their relationship with in situ deposits and their correlation with the structural and depositional evolution of the BVF from the sag phase of the basin This research represents a significant advancement in un derstanding the geological history of the BVF shedding light on the complexities of sedimentary processes and providing insights for future exploration and reservoir management endeavors The sedimentary sequence of the BVF was initially interpreted as biogenic in origin due to the recognition of microbial carbonate facies associated with grainstones packstones and shales deposited in lacus trine environment Moreira et al 2007 Terra et al 2010 Mann and Rigg 2012 Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Green 2016 However other authors such as Wright and Barnett 2015 present different models and describe a chemical abiotic model in shallow evaporitic lakes with the occurrence of cyclic depositions Additional models such as the evaporitic model Farias et al 2019 depict evaporitic sedimentation patterns in endorheic basins while the travertine model Erthal et al 2017 indicates the formation of different morphotypes of travertine systems under various hydrothermal and environmental conditions 2 Geological setting 3 2 Borehole image log interpretation The Pre-Salt sequence in the South Atlantic has its genesis linked to the separation of South America and Africa during the Cretaceous breakup of the western Gondwana Aslanian et al 2009 Moulin et al 2010 The Santos Basin located in the southeast of Brazil is the most prolific hydrocarbon producer in the Brazilian pre-salt province It is separated from the Pelotas Basin by the Floriano polis High to the south and from the Campos Basin by the Cabo Frio High to the north The sedimentary record of the Santos Basin comprises three phases broadly identified as the Rift approximately 138 123 million years ago My Post-rift or sag approximately 123 113 My and Drift approximately 113 0 My Moreira et al 2007 The Rift Supersequence as described by Moreira et al 2007 includes the Cambori Pi arras and Itapema formations The Guaratiba Group belong to the Post-Rift Supersequence charac terized as continental and marginal deposits Moreira et al 2007 Fig 1 The evaporites of the Ariri Formation primarily composed of halite and anhydrite were deposited over the Barra Velha Formation forming a regional seal for the petroleum system Moreira et al 2007 The Aptian BVF is internally divided by the Intra-Alagoas uncon formity which separates the Lower Barra Velha below from the Upper Barra Velha above Wright and Barnett 2015 Gomes et al 2020 Minzoni et al 2020 The thickness of this formation can vary from over 500 m at the depocenter to less than 25 m on fault block highs and may even be locally absent Barnett et al 2018 Minzoni et al 2020 subdivided this formation based on seismic stratigraphic architecture identifying the BVE 300 interval for the Lower BVF below the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity and the BVE 200 and BVE 100 intervals for the Upper BVF The base of the BVE200 corresponds to high-amplitude peak reflectors associated with a transgressive surface above Borehole image tools BHI create images of the borehole walls based on different physical properties such as acoustic impedance or electrical resistivity Lai et al 2018 To characterize the facies of the non-cored intervals of well SB-E1 an approach based on acoustic image log facies analysis was employed following the guidelines proposed by Lai et al 2018 and Basso et al 2022 This approach identifies visual image characteristics such as color scheme image texture and dip patterns Additionally other data sources were considered for facies and compositional analysis in non-cored intervals including photomicro graphs from sidewall cores rock analysis reports and complementary conventional and special logs Acoustic image logs covering a depth of 285 m were interpreted using the Interactive Petrophysics software Lloyd s Register at a high-resolution visualization scale of 1 10 A total of 322 bedding planes were interpreted for the BVF providing detailed information on bedding orientation for the well 3 Methods The studied well SB-E1 have approximately 295 m of the Barra Velha Formation in the Santos Basin however the cored interval was restricted to the uppermost 19 m of the formation Fig 2 To over come the limited sampling a multi-data and multi-scale approach was employed The methodology included 1 petrology and petrography of core samples 2 analysis of borehole image logs BHI facies and 3 interpretation of 3D seismic data 3 1 3D seismic data A post-stack seismic volume in depth was used for this study with crossline and inline separations of 18 5 18 5 m and an inline orien tation of N S The seismic data is presented in accordance with the SEG American convention where a peak with positive amplitude represents an acoustic impedance increment blue on seismic sections The dominant wavenumber ranges between 0 005 m-1 and 0 007 m-1 and the velocity at the reservoir depth is approximately 4500 m s resulting in a vertical resolution of approximately 50 m The seismic data was interpreted in the vicinity of well SB-E1 to support and contextualize the geological characterization performed at the core and well log scales 3 3 Petrology and petrography The geological description of core samples from well SB-E1 is the primary focus of this work Roughly 19 m of core samples from the uppermost interval of the well were described representing approxi mately 14 of the formation thickness Fig 2 One hundred seventeen thin sections of the cored interval were dyed with Alizarin Red S 0 2 g 100 mL of 1 5 HCl and examined to distinguish between calcite and dolomite following the method proposed by Dickson 1966 We con ducted a comprehensive analysis of the constituent components within each rock including matrix cement bioclasts siliciclastic grains and pores To accurately determine the constituent percentages a 2 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 meticulous 300-point count was performed on every thin section To classify microfacies within carbonate rocks we adopted the criteria set forth by Gomes et al 2020 Additionally we considered the diagenetic obliteration criteria as outlined by Lokier and Al Junaibi 2016 In this study we employed two distinct classifications to construct strati graphic columns The first classification based on the Terra et al 2010 system primarily focuses on in situ facies identification by assessing the dimensions of shrubs and spherulites This classification categorizes Fig 1

within an almost continuous interval representing the up permost interval Nine sedimentary facies were identified and grouped into two facies associations FA These groups include FA1 backbarrier

please refer to the accompanying legend FA2 accounting for 25 4 of this interval see Fig 3 Part 3 This section is characterized by a distinct stacking pattern with FA2 con sisting of massive rudstones transitioning to grainstones with rounded pebbles featuring plane-parallel to low-angle cross-lamination Claes et al 2017 including factors such as size and the length width ratio of shrubs These criteria directly influence the shape and lateral continuity of each shrub element In the studied succession the following morphologies were recognized i pustular ii arborescent iii dendritic dendriform iv crust and v irregular These mor phologies are described as having a stacking pattern with progressively larger shrubs at the top creating a type of inverse grading This bedding pattern begins with pustular morphologies gradually transitioning to arborescent or dendritic dendriform forms and culminates in crust forms within a complete high-frequency cycle refer to Fig 4 The pustular shrubs exhibit a size range between 1 mm and 5 mm featuring sub-rounded shapes with an irregular surface and a slight preferential vertical growth Fig 4A They typically have a height-towidth ratio of approximately 1 1 Arborescent shrubs branch upward to form structures that are 10 mm in height with their height being larger than their width resembling miniature trees Fig 4B and C Dendritic dendriform shrubs ranging between 7 and 10 mm are characterized by a branching structure where the height is significantly larger than the width Fig 4D Crust shrubs with heights ranging from 7 to 10 mm are macroscopically defined by laterally coalesced ele ments forming laminated bands of densely packed shrub-like structures that develop perpendicular to the substratum Fig 4D Irregular shrubs not previously described in Claes et al 2017 are classified in the absence of direct relationships with distinguishable shrub elements 4 1 1 Back-barrier deposits - FA1 The facies association 1 occurs at the lowerrmost part of the studied interval and constitute a c 12 m thick coarsening-upward sequence comprises from the base to the top by the following facies i shrub stones ii laminated shrubby spherulitestone iii laminated mudstone iv massive grainstone and v massive rudstone see Fig 3 parts 1 and 2 4 1 1 1 Shrubstones SH The Shrubstones facies is characterized by tabular layers with a thickness ranging from 10 to 50 cm These layers exhibit a depositional contact with grainstones or laminated shrubby spherulitestone at the base and frequent erosional contacts with grain stones at the top Thin wavy clay laminations are often associated with the lower part of these facies This pattern of intercalating shrubstone with clay lamination shrubstone and grainstone is consistently preva lent throughout the entire facies association The SH facies displays elevated porosity and pervasive silicification resulting in the formation of horizontal layers that fill porosity and replace shrubs Various shrub morphologies have been described based on the criteria established by 5 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 Fig 3 continued They are characterized by variable sizes between 8 and 15 mm and have a variable height-to-width ratio Fig 4E The petrographic analysis of the SH facies has identified two distinct microfacies shrubstone and spherulitic shrubstone These microfacies are differentiated based on the proportion of in-situ spherulites Within these microfacies various micromorphologies such as pustular den dritic and fan are recognized with sizes ranging from 0 25 mm to 8 5 mm grading towards the top of the microfacies see Fig 5A E Accessory minerals within these microfacies include sulfides and phosphates Dolomitization is prevalent leading to the replacement and modifi cation of shrub edges with xenotopic hypidiotopic microcrystalline dolomite and porosity filling with sparry dolomite Fig 5A and D Silicification occurs later and to a lesser extent than dolomitization primarily manifesting as microcrystalline cement that replaces particle edges fills porosity and selectively or non-selectively replaces rock fabric elements The observed porosities were intercrystalline pores situated between microcrystalline and sparse dolomite cement Vuggy pores are commonly found in association with calcite relict Fig 5A Growth framework pores are observed among crystal shrubs and their branches Additionally intra-aggregate intra-shrub porosity is characterized by micropores irregularly dispersed throughout the shrub or aligned along internal structures such as growth bands and radial crystals 4 1 1 1 1 Depositional process While the growth patterns of shrubs are primarily described in a lacustrine environment with limited hy drothermal influence several similarities with classical deposits have been identified particularly in the morphology-growth relationships and physical and chemical properties of the environment cf Claes et al 2017 Moreover the transition from smaller less branched shrubs exhibiting poorly developed morphologies e g pustular arbustiform arborescent to larger shrubs with lateral continuity e g crust or crustiform may reflect a gradual increase in water flow rate This in crease in water flow rate favors pCO2 degassing pH elevation and subsequent carbonate precipitation Erthal et al 2017 It is noteworthy that the crustiform morphology described here ex hibits similarities with classic travertine crusts Pentecost 2005 Erthal et al 2017 However it is distinct in that it has a maximum thickness of a few decimeters and resembles a set of laterally agglutinated dendritic shrubs rather than metric crystalline crusts with well-defined internal laminations These irregular crustiform shrubs form on a soft clayey substrate with a high water-to-sediment ratio promoting deformation Similar irregular forms with internal crenulated lamination have been described by Chafetz and Guidry 1999 as a product of both bacterially induced and abiotic precipitation 4 1 1 2 Laminated shrubby spherulitestone SSl The laminated shrubby spherulitestone facies with a thickness ranging from 0 3 to 0 4 m overlays the SH facies with a depositional contact and is overlain by grainstones with an erosive contact or shrubstone with depositional contact This facies exhibits plane-parallel to wavy lamination and often contains thin wavy clay lenses At millimeter to centimeter scales there are high-frequency intercalations of shrubs and spherulites which may be macroscopically indistinguishable Within this facies thin layers of 6 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 Fig 3 continued shrubstones exhibit poorly developed pustular morphologies varying in size from 0 25 mm to 0 7 mm with irregular shapes Fig 4F The petrographic analysis of SSl reveals various in situ spherulite morphologies including spherical polygonal elliptical and coalesced hybrid forms with sizes ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 mm see Fig 5H Spherulitestones in this microfacies are associated with remnants of laminated clay dolomite bridges and sulfides see Fig 5F and G Cementation within these microfacies occurs through microcrystalline hypidiotopic dolomite and sparry calcite The porosities include interaggregate and intra-aggregate Intercrystalline porosity occurs be tween dolomite and calcite crystals while vug porosity results from the dissolution of non-selective fabric elements 4 1 1 2 1 Depositional process In lacustrine phases featuring natu rally alkaline conditions and elevated concentrations of Mg and SiO2 aq cations we observe the chemical precipitation of a poorly crystal line hydrated magnesium silicate gel in the deeper and calmer regions of the lake Wright and Tosca 2016 As the lake level decreases and the Mg Ca ratio in the solution changes due to the gel s precipitation it creates favorable conditions for clay sedimentation and the nucleation of low-Mg calcite or aragonite This leads to the formation of spherulites in the deeper sections of the lake Wright and Tosca 2016 Chafetz et al 2017 Conversely the shrubby interval is more frequent and exhibits more developed shrub-like morphologies due to increased water flow rates CO2 degassing and a rise in pH levels Erthal et al 2017 These favorable conditions for the development of shrubby intervals are pri marily identified in the lake s more marginal areas High-frequency fluctuations in the lake s water level have played a significant role in creating favorable conditions for the formation of millimetric layers of shrubstones and spherulitestones spherulitestone facies with a depositional contact and they exhibit an erosional contact underlying massive rudstones Fig 4E Within these mudstones diagenetic silica nodules are present characterized by almond-shaped to rounded forms ranging in size from 1 to 2 mm Additionally silica layers with thickness varying between 1 and 3 mm are often interspersed within these mudstones at the top of FA1 4 1 1 3 1 Depositional process Mudstones as defined by Gomes et al 2020 are identified based on their mineralogical composition which can include silica nodules Mg-clay minerals and or dolomite The mudstone-claystone-laminite facies are the product of reworked sediments or sedimentation in the deeper regions of the lake Wright and Barnett 2020 describe that Mg-clay mudstones associated with spherulites in the deeper parts of the lake serve as strong indicators of in-situ facies just as the transition from laminated calcimudstone to spherulite-dominated lithologies strongly suggests that the facies have not undergone significant reworking Flooding events occurring during periods of elevated humidity contribute to the rise in lake levels and result in the mixing of chemical stratifications In these humid periods a decrease in pH is observed alongside the formation of silica nodules as documented by Wright and Tosca in 2016 Additionally there is an increased settling of clays in the deeper regions as reported by Gomes et al 2020 4 1 1 4 Massive grainstone Gm The massive grainstone facies is observed in beds of decimetric thickness ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 m These beds are deposited in tabular layers with an erosive contact at the base and a depositional contact at the top in association with the SH and SSl facies Fig 4A and D Diagenetic silica nodules are characterized by angular to subrounded shapes varying in size from 1 to 10 mm Addi tionally frequent silica layers are present at the top of the facies with thicknesses ranging between 2 and 5 mm Petrographic analyses have facilitated the identification of three distinct microfacies i intraclast grainstone ii spherulite grainstone and iii shrub grainstone These grainstones exhibit a fining-upward pattern concerning carbonate particles encompassing silica nodules 4 1 1 3 Laminated mudstone Ml The laminated mudstone facies is observed in beds approximately 0 5 m thick ranging from 0 3 to 0 8 m featuring discontinuous plane-parallel to wave lamination These mud stones are deposited overlying

upper portion shrubs fragments become smaller less frequent and more altered The Gm facies is primarily characterized by hypidiotopic and idiotopic dolomite cementation The dolomitization process con tributes to the altered features observed in the Gm facies microfacies 4 1 1 4 1 Depositional process In the context of FA1 the massive grainstone facies can have two possible origins i transport and reworking by hyperconcentrated flow and ii wave reworking The i process is associated with the progressive deceleration of gravity flows favoring the formation of waning flow deposits This results in the sedimentation of increasingly finer facies as discussed by Nemec and Steel 1984 In this scenario flows gradually decelerate upon entering the lake as hyperpycnal flows leading to the dispersion of finer sedi ments in more distal regions The ii process is controlled by high-frequency variations inthe lake level Sporadic increases in lake level lead to reworking processes occurring at the fair-weather wave base primarily at the top of the shrubstones forming erosional surfaces In this case the origin of the 8 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 Fig 5

fining-upward pattern with the largest clasts ranging from 0 1 to 0 2 m situated at the base of the set The clasts themselves have angular and tabular shapes resembling flat pebbles and align with the layer deposition Fig 4G While carbonate clasts particularly the tabular ones domi nate the largest and most angular clasts are often associated with silicified carbonate Mudstone clasts are elongated and occasionally crushed whereas grainstone and shrubstone clasts tend to be smaller 4 1 1 5 Flat pebble rudstone Rfp The flat pebble rudstones present in approximately 0 5-m thick beds ranging from 0 3 to 0 8 m These beds either erosively or non-erosively cover the Gm facies or other sets of Rfp facies and exhibit a gradual transition with the Gm facies at the top 9 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 carbonate- and silica-rich layers The provenance of the ruptile layers may be associated with mud-flat carbonates and or silica layers exposed to subaerial dehydration at lake margins e g Krainer and Spo tl 1998 Indeed dehydration result in shrinkage and soft-sediment deformation of lacustrine silica-gels leading to the formation of ruptile layers prone to fragmentation and later reworking Krainer and Spo tl 1998 Possibly the reworking associates with episodes of more significant rainfall in the drainage area runoff as outlined in previous studies cf Pietzsch et al 2018 Figs 3 and 6B In this case the observed vertical stacking of several rudstone layers indicates several episodes of hyper concentrated flows entering the lake suggesting a more humid period characterized by more frequent episodes of higher rainfall The HCF events occur in different pulses forming distinct amal gamated cycles that overlap resulting in incomplete fining-upward cy cles often eroded at the top by the reactivation of new flows Interpretation The absence of marine records in the studied facies along with radiogenic strontium data as a proxy described in Pietzsch et al 2018 corroborates the interpretation that the carbonate facies of the Barra Velha Formation including FA1 were deposited in the context of a closed lake The studied interval reveals a substantial number of in situ facies predominantly the SH facies with diverse morphologies providing evidence of high water alkalinity and ion concentration cf Erthal et al 2017 The formation of shrubs in shallower conditions within this lake is directly associated with increased kinetic energy and CO2 degassing Erthal et al 2017 The shallow lake conditions are also supported by the reworking of the top of the SH and SSl facies by the Gm facies attributed to fair-weather wave reworking as well as hyper concentrated flow The chemical conditions characterized by high alkalinity and ion concentration in the lake are strongly influenced by hydrothermal vents In the Campos Basin the impact of hydrothermal vents associated with volcanic activity on the mineralogical composition of talcstevensite has been emphasized by several authors Winter et al 2007 Alvarenga et al 2016 Souza et al 2018 have also highlighted the potential influence of hydrothermal inflows in the Santos Basin contributing to the formation of travertine carbonate deposits The hy pothesis of hydrothermal vents supplying essential elements for the development of shrubs and spherulites is supported The inflow rates of and subangular The rudstone facies displays microfacies variations in the pro portions of intraclasts spherulites shrub fragments and sulfides Based on these differences in proportions two distinct microfacies have been identified i intraclast rudstone and ii spherulite rudstone The intraclast rudstone microfacies is characterized by a prevalence of intraclasts showing low sorting and tightly packed grains see Fig 5K Carbonate intraclasts primarily dolomitized or silicified dominate this microfacies and are mostly angular to sub-angular in shape These intraclasts can also exhibit laminated textures ranging in size from 0 25 to 7 mm Mudstone clasts elongated and deformed by compaction ranging from 0 4 mm to 2 mm are also present and may be replaced by microcrystalline dolomite On the other hand the spherulite rudstone microfacies contains predominantly larger clasts 2 mm with angular shapes surrounded by coalesced spherulites and spherical spherulites see Fig 5L Despite alteration well-preserved shrub fragments with a fan morphology are found in the spherulite rudstone microfacies Dolomite cement in this microfacies varies between microcrystalline hypidiotopic dolomite and sparry dolomite replacing the grains Silica cement occurring in a microcrystalline form fills the porosity and mainly replaces carbonate intraclasts This microfacies exhibits the highest porosity and includes interparticle intraparticle intercrystal line and vug pores 4 1 1 5 1 Depositional process At the top of FA1 the Rfp represents a basal erosive coarse rudstone resulting from hyper-concentrated flow HCF as described by Nemec and Steel 1984 and Zavala 2020 HCFs are high-density subaerial flows characterized by high sediment load The presence of erosive base and normal grading likely indicates insipient turbulence Turbulent flows are characterized by upward movement of clasts during this process clasts are separated by density where heavier and denser particles settles first resulting in a normal grading arrangement Mulder and Alexander 2001 However the structureless character of the rudstone advocates to the rapid sedimen tation of high density flows which hinders the formation of sedimentary structures Nemec and Steel 1984 In fact the coexistence of high density flows with insipient turbulence might suggest a hyper concentrated flow behaviour sensu Mulder and Alexander 2001 As observed in the Rpf facies some of these reworked rudstones may contain flat pebbles likely associated with the reworking of ruptile Fig 6 2D schematic models showing the transport and deposition of FA1 A Fair-weather waves shatter particles producing ooids B Hyper-concentrated flow entering the shallow lake 10 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 these hydrothermal systems vary over time leading to changes in water saturation and the depositional relationships of these facies Karner and Gamboa 2007 Reston 2010 Pietzsch et al 2018 Besides the influ ence of lacustrine hydrothermal vents which supply and saturate the water with ions the role of groundwater flows and small drainages in altering water composition is also discussed Pietzsch et al 2018 FA1 deposition is controlled by two types of cyclicity with i lowfrequency cycles superimposing ii high-frequency cycles Low- frequency cycles are likely autogenic and correspond to the overall coarsening-upward trend in the facies association 2 varying from a lowermost interval dominated by shrubstones to an uppermost interval dominated by rudstones This trend likely correspond to the lateral shift of the input source of the hyperconcentrated flows Three types of highfrequency cycles are depicted The first correspond to thinning-upward cycles related to hyper-concentrated flows frequently observed in the Rfp facies overlain by Gm due to the gradual deceleration and loss of Fig 7 Photographs of core samples illustrating sedimentary facies Gl Gp and Rm

second cyclicity type is identified by reworking cycles with SH facies erosively overlapped by Gm due to the action of fair-weather wave base and periodic rainfall that favor the transport and dispersion of the most distal facies of the HCF reworking the top of the facies in situ Fig 3 part 1 and 6 The third cycle type is observed from the growth of shrub morphology towards the top of the SH facies The three types of cycles likely result from high-frequency climate oscillations which regulate the depositional processes by con trolling i episodes of high precipitation and overland flow

diameter Fig 7B and C In thin section the pebble grainstone is formed by the alternation between two microfacies i intraclastic- and ii spherulitic grain stones The intraclastic grainstone is predominantly composed of car bonate intraclasts with subordinate amount of spherulites ooids and few occurrences of ostracodes they show moderate sorting varying from 0 1 to 2 1 mm in diameter Fig 8D The spherulitic grainstone is predominantly composed of spherulites with minor occurrence of car bonate intraclasts ooids and shrub fragments The spherulites exhibit various morphologies including spherical elliptical polygonal which ultimately occur coalesced at places Fig 8E The ooids frequently show spherulite cores and their cortex display concentric smooth laminae whilst the shrub fragments demonstrate some degree of alteration Fig 8F Overall the spherulitic grainstone displays moderate sorting where allochems range from 0 2 to 1 7 mm in diameter Finally the facies is marked by hypidiotopic and idiotopic dolomite cementation 4 1 2 2 1 Depositional process The presence of rounded pebbles in grainstones is directly associated with the wave reworking of episodic hyperconcentrated flow primarily influenced by fair-weather waves Supporting evidence for wave reworking includes the occurrence of rounded grains and a substantial quantity of ooids Chen et al 2012 detailed subangular pebble-sized intraclasts in grainstones resembling our facies which were deposited in moderately agitated shallow-subtidal environments The increased concentration of pebbles towards the top of the pebble grainstone facies indicates relatively higher-energy conditions cf Hiroki and Terasaka 2005 Milroy and Wright 2000 proposed that the association of oolitic grainstones with gravel-conglomerate akin to our massive rudstone facies at the top of the unit suggests highly variable energy levels over relatively short distances This variability implies a response to both storm waves and fair-weather processes on a gently inclined beachface 4 1 2 Foreshore-shoreface transition deposits - FA2 The facies association 2 occurs at the uppermost part of the studied interval and constitute a c 7 m thick coarsening-upward sequence that is formed from the base to the top by the following facies i laminated grainstone ii pebble grainstone and iii massive rudstone Fig 7 4 1 2 1 Laminated grainstone Gl The laminated grainstone facies occurs in c 1 m thick beds from 0 9 to 1 2 m that show gradual transition with the facies association 1 at the base and are erosively overlaid by pebble grainstone facies at the top The grainstone beds are organized into c 30 50 mm thick wedge-shaped bedsets outlined by low-angle flat boundaries of opposing apparent dip directions Fig 7A and A Internally the wedge-shaped sets display low-angle planar parallel laminae that lye conformably to the set base and show erosive contact with the top set boundary The low-angle laminae are c 2 5 mm thick and laterally continuous throughout the core Fig 7A Individual lamina further displays inverse grading varying from medium-coarse sand at the base to coarse sand at the top Moreover the grainstone is predominantly composed of ooids and locally displays carbonate and silica clasts interspersed between laminae In thin section the laminated grainstone reveals three alternating microfacies i spherulitic- ii oolitic- and iii shrubby grainstone The spherulites range from 0 2 to 1 3 mm in diameter and display varying degrees of alteration they exhibit spherical fractured elliptical and polygonal morphologies locally showing coalesced spherulites of different morphologies see Fig 8A The coalesced and fused forms of spherulites are more abundant towards the top of the profile and exhibit less alteration compared to other morphologies see Fig 8B The ooids range from 0 25 to 0 5 mm in diameter showing distinct core compo sitions primarily consisting of spherulites Towards the upper part of the profile the ooids become coarser and display compacted features such as deformed angular shapes and broken edges see Fig 8C Finally the microfacies reveal predominance of hypidiotopic and idiotopic dolomite cementation and further display fragments of bioclasts ostracods pel lets sulfides and phosphates as accessory elements 4 1 2 1 1 Depositional process The laminated grainstone facies provides compelling evidence of swash-backwash effects in beach areas A prominent feature of this facies is the presence of wedge-shaped sets indicative of bidirectional flows These sets characterized by parallel laminae formed during the lake-shoreline elevation demonstrate the planar display of the depositional environment Notably the tops of these laminations show truncation by low-angle laminations formed by current crescents on beach faces influenced by backwash flow Bhat tacharya 1993 Laminations resulting from swash-backwash processes exhibit inverse grading attributed to high-concentration flows where frequent grain collisions occur Asbury and Sallinger 1981 During the initial stages of upwash the breaking of waves on the foreshore induces large-scale turbulence leading to a substantial amount of suspended sediment This sediment is then added to the bedload in the final stages of upwash Subsequently the upwash behaves similarly to backwash transporting sediment primarily in a highly concentrated bedload and commonly resulting in inverse grading Clif ton 1969 The presence of low-angle laminations associated with well-sorted and well-rounded reworked grains is a characteristic feature of wavedominated sandy beach environments Clifton 2003 2006 Addition ally the abundance of reworked ooids in this facies often exhibiting tangential fabrics is more likely to be preserved during grain-to-grain collisions under turbulent conditions Tucker and Wright 1990 4 1 2 3 Massive rudstone Rm The massive rudstone constitute c 1 m thick beds ranging from 0 4 to 1 3 m that erosively overly the lami nated grainstone and occur vertically stacked along a c 2 m thick in terval The rudstone facies demonstrated structureless character and is formed by c 70 150 mm clasts with angular to subrounded angularity and low sphericity resembling irregular to flat tabular pebbles and cobbles Fig 7E The clasts are oligomictic displaying mostly silicified carbonates with subordinate presence of non-silicified carbonates Locally the massive rudstone facies shows c 3 5 mm thick silica-rich layers Fig 7E In thin section the rudstone facies is formed by the alternation be tween intraclastic and spherulitic rudstone microfacies Both microfa cies show varying proportions of intraclasts spherulites shrub fragments and sulfides they are commonly characterized by low sorting and tightly packed grains see Fig 8G The intraclastic rudstone microfacies shows mostly dolomitized or silicified clasts with angular to sub-angular roundness Internally the intraclasts exhibit laminated textures where laminae range from 0 25 to 7 mm in thickness Addi tionally mudstone intraclasts range from c 0 4 2 mm in dimension and resemble elongated clasts that are locally marked by deformed edges and replacive microcrystalline dolomite In contrast the spherulitic rudstone microfacies is formed by larger 2 mm in dimension and angular clasts that occur interspersed between spherical and coalesced spherulites see Fig 8H Moreover well-preserved fan-shaped shrub fragments are observed displaying some degree of alteration Fig 8I Overall the rudstone microfacies are marked by microcrystalline hypi diotopic dolomite and sparry dolomite cementation Fig 8J Also silica fringe covers the intraclasts and microcrystalline silica is further depicted as porosity infills and carbonate intraclast replacement Fig 8K Finally the rudstone microfacies displays interparticle intraparticle intercrystalline and vug pores and present the highest 4

7 highly diagenetic altered carbonates Facies 1 5 were observed in the cored interval and their detailed petrology and petrography were reported earlier Facies 6 and 7 on the other hand were identified exclusively in the image logs This study revealed that reworked carbonate deposits constitute a significant portion of the BVF approximately 63 of its thickness with grainstones-packstones accounting for 36 and rudstones-grainstones facies for 17 Volcanic-related sediments make up approximately 10 of the BVF The image log displays reworked facies with low amplitude values rough texture and a mottled appearance The mottled texture is characterized by high amplitude bright spots that vary in ge ometry size and abundance zoomed images in the 2nd to 4th panels Fig 9 The reworked carbonates exhibit a wide range of grain sizes including particles up to pebble size The grains primarily consist of intraclasts derived from various BVF facies including fragments of shrubs spherulites mudstones and silicified particles Vertical distri bution analysis of the facies in the SB-E1 well shows that grainstones and rudstones dominate in the uppermost 100 m corresponding to the Upper BVF while coarse volcanic-related sediments such as volcanic grainstones and rudstones are more prevalent in the Lower BVF The volcanic grainstones-rudstones are enriched with altered lithic frag ments primarily of basaltic composition zoomed image in the 4th panel Fig 9 Bedding orientations derived from the interpretation of bedding planes in the image log 3rd column Fig 9 indicate a main dip direction towards the southeast mean azimuth 110 Analyzing the dip di rections within different intervals of the BVF minor variations are observed with the general trend shifting from southeast to east in the lowermost 50 m of the formation The bedding dip angle gradually in creases from 6 31 in the uppermost part of the formation to 24 53 in the basal portion porosity among the studied microfacies Fig 8L 4 1 2 3 1 Depositional process The massive rudstone as well as the Rfp facies is deposited within a hyper-concentrated flow HCF context similar to that elucidated by Zavala 2020 These facies showcase notable amounts of coarse particles and matrix featuring tabular clasts Turbulence within the HCF promotes the separation of clasts by density resulting in a normal grading arrangement where the heaviest and densest particles are deposited first a phenomenon well-documented by Mulder and Alexander 2001 The lack of sedimentary structures associated with this facies is primarily ascribed to the swift deposition in high-density flows as expounded by Nemec and Steel 1984 The significant quantity of eroded in situ facies giving rise to frag ments of shrubs and spherulites alongside associated cobble clasts emerges from the reworking influence of fair-weather waves cf Hiroki and Terasaka 2005 Despite the presence of flat pebbles in this facies they manifest in smaller proportions and exhibit a more disordered arrangement The reworking action induced by waves contributes to clast fragmentation and rounding thereby shaping the distinct charac teristics observed cf Hiroki and Terasaka 2005 Interpretation This study interprets the observed facies as indicative of a transi tional zone between the foreshore and shoreface considering the extent of grain rounding and sedimentary structures that align with marginal settings influenced by wave action In the context of a shallow lake we adapted the traditional classification of external shelf environments i e foreshore and shoreface to accommodate the morphodynamic var iations identified in the facies description The presence of oolitic grainstone facies characterized by wellsorted and well-rounded grains and lamination ranging from parallel to low-angle offers crucial evidence for interpreting a foreshore envi ronment under upper flow regime This suggests upper plane bed deposition on a beach face Elliott 1986 Masuda and Yokokawa 1988 Hiroki and Terasaka 2005 The intercalation of Gp and Gl facies in dicates sporadic increases in swash energy within the foreshore to shoreface The hyper-concentrated flow HCF deposited in the surf zone of the upper shoreface facilitating the rounding of pebbles due to the continuous action of fair-weather waves The erosive surfaces observed at the base of the Gp facies represent the retreat of foreshore facies due to shoreline advancement cf Hamon-Kerivel et al 2020 The Gp and Rm facies suggest a transition zone between the upper and lower shoreface characterized by decreased energy conditions This transition occurs as the surf zone with high activity shifts to a deeper zone dominated by wave shoaling Aagaard 2014 The Rm facies originates from the deposition of HCF in the lower shoreface and ex hibits reworking to a lesser extent by fair-weather or storm waves compared to the upper shoreface zone 4 2 2 Seismic interpretation The analysis of reflector geometries and seismic facies distributions provides valuable insights into the stratigraphic evolution of the Barra Velha Formation BVF in the vicinity of well SB-E1 The transition between the Itapema Formation ITPF and BVF is marked by the PAU Fig 10 blue line which is a positive reflector exhibiting high ampli tude and characterized by erosional truncations The transition between the BVE-200 and BVE-100 intervals is identified by a negative reflector with high amplitude commonly observed throughout the study area Fig 10 black line In general the ITPF reflectors demonstrate onlap onto the basement and exhibit a greater dip angle compared to the BVF They display an average dip angle of 15 in the southeast direction ranging from irregular to sheet-like shapes with low amplitude RGP4 Fig 10B On the other hand the BVF reflectors onlap the basement RGP1 and gradually change their dip angle towards the basin southeast with an average dip angle of 6 in the BVE-200 interval and 3 in the BVE-100 interval Fig 10B These results are consistent with the dip measure ments obtained from the interpretation of bedding planes in the bore hole image log Fig 9 Towards the bottom of the BVF the reflectors exhibit a low ampli tude varying from irregular to sheet-like shapes oriented towards the top Fig 10B RGP3 However the reflectors in the upper part of the BVF display a high amplitude and a mounded shape characterized by a bidirectional high-amplitude reflector Fig 10B and C RGP2 4 2 Borehole image and seismic interpretation In addition to describing the core samples the borehole image log BHI data Fig 9 of well SB-E1 was integrated with seismic in terpretations to enhance our understanding of the stratigraphic evolu tion of the BVF In this study the BVF is divided into two major stratigraphic zones the lower interval known as BVE-200 and the upper interval known as BVE-100 Minzoni et al 2020 Rebelo et al 2022 The base of the BVE-200 is defined by the Pre-Alagoas Unconformity PAU while the top of the BVE-100 is marked by the presence of evaporites from the Ariri Formation It should be noted that the BVE-300 interval was not identified at the location of this well 4 2 1 BHI interpretation The acoustic image log interpretation provided insights into the facies composition of non-cored intervals covering approximately 285 m of the BVF Fig 9 Following a similar approach as previous studies Muniz and Bosence 2015 Gomes et al 2020 Basso et al 2022 a total of seven facies were identified 1 spherulitestones 2 5 Discussion stratigraphic evolution of BVF Through analyses and interpretations at different scales it was possible to describe the facies associations and correlate them with the stratigraphic evolution of BVF deposits in the study area Although the 14 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 Fig 9 Well log interpretation of well SB-E1 focused on

and stratigraphic surfaces C The consistent identification of Retrogradational Pattern 2 RGP2 across diverse crosslines strongly suggests a transgressive phase most detailed work focused on BVE-100 due to the availability of core sections the same depositional relationship between reworked and in situ deposits was observed throughout the entire interval through the interpretation of image logs and side wall samples BVE-200 and BVE100 In the BHI the transition from ITPF to BVF is marked by the presence of the PAU and reworked sediments The base of BVE-200 exhibits larger clast fragments and a higher concentration of volcanic grains compared to BVE-100 see Fig 9 Additionally it displays a steeper dip angle of bedding planes During the deposition of BVE-200 sediment supply exceeded the accommodation resulting in the development of a pro gradational stacking pattern with a steeper dip angle as exemplified by Catuneanu 2002 These progradational patterns consist of large clasts particularly volcaniclastic rocks likely associated with the erosive ef fects of topographically higher regions see Fig 10 Barnett et al 2021 associate these deposits as a product of gravity flows of fan deltas originating from nearby structural highs The topographic highs iden tified in Fig 10B experienced partial erosion of the Itapema and Cam bori formations possibly contributing to gravity flows and the formation of RGP3 see Figs 3 and 4 The BVE-100 was deposited during a more stable phase character ized by frequent in-situ facies reworked by waves smaller but abundant clasts a significant presence of ooids and wedge-shaped sets The BVE100 records more coastal onlaps and shallower facies as evidenced by the seismic reflectors RGP1 and RGP2 and by BHI facies and the backbarrier and fore-barrier facies associations see Fig 11 The presence of BVE-300 was not identified in the well or seismic images likely due to erosion of its thin marginal sequences To understand the evolution of seismic-stratigraphic events between ITPF and BVF the terminations of seismic onlaps were applied to construct a lacustrine onlap curve which reflects the migration of the lake margin e g Haq and Schutter 2008 Fig 12 In the ITPF the Fig 11 2D schematic models identify the relationship between depositional environments and their main sedimentary facies 16 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024 106700 Fig 12 The evolutive geological model for BVE200 and BVE100 Seismic profile and onlap curve based on seismic interpretations of stratigraphic surfaces reflecting the lake level variation onlap curve indicates a more restricted lake with deposition occurring in a regressive phase of RGP4 The RGP4 indicates a progradational pattern whose topset was eroded by the PAU In the BVF the onlap migration direction undergoes a drastic change shifting landward and evidencing the expanding margins of the lake as expected for a sag phase While we demonstrate transgressive phases in the lake studies such as Pietzsch et al 2018 indicate that no marine contribution oc curs during BVF deposition The seismic data displays a landward onlap migration pattern for the BVF Fig 12 due to increased lake size However the occurrence of a shallowing-upward pattern is possible due to high carbonate production and accumulation during the sag phase of the basin both through the chemical precipitation of carbonates in situ and the recurring inputs of transported clastic particles Moreover Pietzsch et al 2018 interpret a shallow endorheic lake with a high evaporation rate based on 13C and 18O analyses identifying 13 cycles of lake stage with the last three cycles at the top of BVF exhibiting depleted 18O This depletion possibly indicates an increase in freshwater or groundwater input into the system promoting a rise in lake level in aligment with our onlap curve Fig 12 The BVE-100 involves the superimposition of coarse reworked facies from a foreshore-shoreface transition onto primarily in situ facies from the back-barrier deposits This facies association overlap reflects the lateral migration of environments resulting from a retrogradational stacking pattern during transgressive phase in the depositional se quences which is consistent with seismic interpretations and the onlap curve Figs 11 and 12 While we have identified the transgressive pattern of facies associations the stratigraphic profiles exhibit a different facies stacking with a coarsening upward trend attributed to the predominance of rudstone facies at the top of the stratigraphic profiles This coarsening upward stacking is a reflection of lowfrequency cycles that correspond to the lateral shift of the input source of hyperconcentrated flows Fig 12 Andrews et al 2016 describe a similar example to what is discussed here identifying a shallow lake with inter-bars ponds and ephemeral fluvial systems that exhibit a lateral shift of the input source influencing the lacustrine shore zone architecture differently and sporadically deposit and rework the top of the lacustrine facies forming a coarsening-upward pattern With regards to the BVE-100 the structures associated with RGP2 resemble a mound-like carbonate structure The carbonate mound-like feature described in this study is a barrier built through low-frequency and high-frequency cycles with lacustrine in situ facies affected by HCF and wave influence Some cyclic patterns presented in this work particularly the high-frequency reworking cycles are partially discussed in Soares et al 2023 The seismic analysis reveals bidirectional dip angles within the RGP2 strata which align with the positioning of carbonate mound-like struc tures on the reworked deposits of the BVE-200 Fig 12 However it is important to note that the mound-like structures described in this study differ from modern carbonate mounds such as those documented by Hebbeln and Samankassou 2015 Nevertheless similar features can be identified in this study including the formation of belts or clusters of mounds as observed in the seismic images depicted in Fig 10 This cluster pattern is commonly observed in numerous Paleozoic examples worldwide including regions in Morocco and Algeria Wendt et al 2001 Belgium Aretz and Chevaliers 2007 the UK Bridges and Chapman 1988 and New Mexico USA Jeffery and Stanton 1996 6 Hydrocarbon potential and exploration in reworked deposits The increasing demand for energy driven by industrial and social consumption has led to extensive exploration of conventional oil and gas reservoirs Modern stratigraphic studies highlight the significant po tential for hydrocarbon exploration in deepwater environments 17 R S P de Medeiros et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 161 2024

diverse geological settings particularly emphasizing coarse clastic deposits formed by gravity flows Yuan et al 2019 Yong et al 2023 In the Santos Basin the oil system consists of source shales from the Pi arras and Itapema formations and reservoir carbonates from the Barra Velha Formation Anomalous re gions with higher production are often associated with wells containing a significant amount of reworked material de Freitas et al 2022 Apart from the sediment type the geometry of these reworked bodies is directly linked to the development of primary porosity pore connec tivity and enhanced productivity In this context the well SB-E1 emerges as one of the top ten producers in the basin in recent years i e 2022 averaging 23 000 barrels per month and reaching up to 35 000 barrels per month during the peak exploration period ANP 2023 The upper part of well SB-E1 FA2 as discussed in the sedimentary facies analysis represents the most productive interval Several signifi cant petrographic and stratigraphic characteristics can be identified to justify this high productivity These include lower silicification compared to BVE-200 based on the image log facies Fig 9 a sub stantial amount of primary and secondary porosity with close pore connections facies exhibiting a high degree of sorting and minimal regional erosional features Additional morpho-stratigraphic aspects that contribute to the high productivity of deposits in FA1 and FA2 include their good lateral continuity strong vertical connectivity high aspect ratio and trapping of these layers by the thick overlying salt pack

comprehensive analysis of the depositional patterns and facies associations within the BVF deposits in the study area Through detailed examinations at various scales particularly focusing on BVE-100 and extending insights through BVE-200 the research has uncovered significant insights into the stratigraphic evolution of the basin A notable achievement of this work is the identification and description of foreshore-shorefacies as sociations marking the first instance of such characterization in this context The recognition of these associations in the BVE-100 with their unique features such as frequent in situ facies reworking by waves and swash-backwash activites in beach zone enriches our comprehension of nearshore environments during specific depositional phases The origin of reworked deposits in the BVE-200 and the BVE-100 is a focal point in our findings The larger clast fragments and heightened concentration of volcanic grains in the BVE-200 suggest a prograda tional stacking pattern resulting from sediment supply surpassing ac commodation The erosive effects of topographically higher regions likely associated with gravity flows contribute to the formation of these reworked deposits On the other hand the BVE-100 deposited during a more stable phase presents a distinctive combination of foreshoreshorefacies and in-situ facies from back-barrier deposits shedding light on lateral environmental shift during transgressive phase The study provides comprehensive insights into the transgressive phases in the BVF The construction of a lacustrine onlap curve coupled with seismic data demonstrates a marked shift in onlap migration di rection from a more restricted lake phase in the ITPF to an expanding phase during the sag phase of the BVF A cruacial aspect of our study centers on the interpretation of moundlike structures particularly those linked to RGP2 in the BVE-100 Drawing upon abiotic mound models we propose an interpretation shaped by both low-frequency and high-frequency cycles These struc tures exhibit a barrier-like nature influenced by lacustrine in situ facies affected by HCF and wave activity Although our findings diverge from the characteristics of modern carbonate mounds our study identifies shared features such as the formation of belts or clusters of mounds aligning with examples observed globally In conclusion this research not only deepens our understanding of Data availability The authors do not have permission to share data

Rueil-Malmaison Cedex France A R T I C L E I N F O A B S T R A C T Keywords Pre-salt Santos Basin Lacustrine carbonates Diagenesis Dolomitization Aptian carbonate rocks of Santos Basin in the Brazilian southeastern continental margin show a highly hetero geneous reservoir quality conditioned by many controlling factors This study presents a quantitative approach based on an integrated petrographic mineralogical and geochemical dataset of the Barra Velha Formation BVF to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of depositional and diagenetic aspects and the parameters controlling the nature and distribution of the diagenetic phases in Santos Basin pre-salt carbonate reservoirs In this formation 3 units can be differentiated The facies with higher Mg-clay content predominate in lower structural positions and regions with low relative relief Higher proportions of spherulites occur in the transi tional zones and fascicular calcite occurs preferentially in the transitional and higher structural positions Grainstones are observed in all depositional environments but with variations in their composition intraclasts siliciclastic volcanoclastic grain and clay content Stratigraphically facies with higher Mg-clay content pre dominate in Units 3 base and 2 intermediate whereas Unit 1 top is marked by a greater proportion of grainstones and fascicular calcite In Unit 1 fascicular calcite crusts tend to expand from the structural high toward lower areas The distribution of the main diagenetic products and their association with different facies highlight the role of depositional setting and primary constituents on the diagenetic processes The tectonic and climatic context of the BVF favored the preferential precipitation and accumulations of Mg-clays in lower structural portions of the basin The preservation of Mg-clays is also strongly linked to the structural setting with more intense diagenetic alterations in higher structural areas Dolomite is a major diagenetic phase in the studied samples followed by silica These diagenetic phases are largely associated with Mg-clay alteration and pre dominate in Unit 1 Mg-clays dissolution as well as major alteration of carbonate phases are concentrated in higher structural positions Given the higher occurrence of faults in these areas and the presence of saddle dolomite barite celestine and fluorite which are typical products of hydrothermal alteration part of the dissolution processes may be related to hydrothermal alteration The depositional and diagenetic aspects indicate a close connection between the hydrochemical evolution of the lake waters with the origin and diagenesis of these deposits 1 Introduction occurrence of giant offshore reservoirs this sedimentary formation has

2017 Pietzsch et al 2018 Artaga o 2018 Lima and De Ros 2019 Some of the first works analyzing the pre-salt de posits attributed their formation to microbial-influenced processes referring to them as microbialites and stromatolites Dias 2005 Moreira et al 2007 Terra et al 2010 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Merce des-Mart n et al 2016 while others proposed an abiotic origin Wright and Barnett 2015 Tosca and Wright 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Wright 2022 These latter works reported the scarcity of macrostructures and microstructures characteristic of microbial carbonates and the crystal line fabrics and isotopic composition indicative of an abiotic chemo genic origin of the pre-salt deposits Herlinger et al 2017 interpreted these deposits as due to syngenetic precipitation controlled by changes of the lacustrine geochemistry resulting essentially in encrustation and replacement of stevensite deposits The existence of peculiar features and mineral phases in these de posits allows the interpretation of different precipitation conditions and makes it difficult to find an ideal analogue Mercedes-Mart n et al 2017 Deschamps et al 2020 Magalhaes et al 2020 Wright 2022 Furthermore the close connection between the syngenetic and eodia genetic processes highlights the importance of disentangling the diagenesis suffered by the pre-salt deposits Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Sartorato et al 2020 Wright and Barnett 2020 Several studies emphasized the role of early diagenesis on the evolution of the deposits mainly related to the dissolution of Mg-clay substrates and its replacement by calcite spherulites dolomite and silica Tosca and Wright 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 In fact the Aptian carbonate rocks of Campos and Santos Basins show that reservoir quality is strongly conditioned by the characteristics of the depositional envi ronment and the associated diagenetic alterations Rezende and Pope 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 The impact of diagenesis on the evolution of porosity and permeability is according to several authors not restricted to early alteration processes clay replacement or dissolution calcite cementation but also to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids in some locations of the basin Vieira de Luca et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Lima et al 2020 Sartorato et al 2020 Thus the combination of these sedimentary and diagenetic processes leads to the formation of complex and heterogeneous reservoirs Un derstanding the spatial distribution of the diagenetic products is essen tial to determine the factors controlling the reservoir properties and to be predictive Morad et al 2012 Whitaker and Frazer 2018 Although previous studies have provided detailed petrographic analyses and paragenetic relationships of the primary and diagenetic constituents of the Barra Velha Formation BVF from the Santos Basin Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Farias et al 2019 Carramal et al 2022 and the coeval Macab Formation from the Campos Basin Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 an integrated quantitative view of the spatial and temporal distribution of the syngenetic and diagenetic phases is lacking The characterization and interpretation of these pro cesses and products are still a matter of debate and the definition of their quantitative distribution will contribute to the understanding of the paleoenvironmental conditions that drove the formation and mod ifications of these sediments Based on a huge database of petrographic descriptions this study aims to present a comprehensive quantitative characterization of the main depositional and diagenetic features of the lacustrine carbonates of the Barra Velha Formation BVF from a key area of the outer high in the Santos Basin It also seeks to present spatial and temporal distribution patterns of facies and diagenetic products at reservoir scale based on petrography mineralogical analyses and carbon and oxygen stable isotope data Finally it discusses the different processes syngenetic eodiagenetic and late hydrothermal-related that control the reservoir heterogeneities of the South-Atlantic pre-salt succession The results will contribute to a better understanding of the origin and evolution of these carbonate rocks and provide valuable constraints to reservoir characterization 2 Geological setting 2 1 Geodynamics The Santos Basin on the southeastern portion of the Brazilian con tinental margin extends along the coast of Rio de Janeiro Sa o Paulo Parana e Santa Catarina states between parallels 23 and 28 South and covers a total area of approximately 350 000 km2 Fig 1A and B The basin is located between the Pelotas Basin to the south bounded by the Florianopolis high and Campos Basin to the north bounded by the Cabo Frio high Moreira et al 2007 The Santos Basin was formed during Early Cretaceous by the breakup of the Gondwana Continent The Mesozoic rifting started in the southern parts of the South American continent in the Late Jurassic reaching the equatorial margin by Late Aptian Early Albian culminating in the separation of South American and African Plates Rabinowitz and Lab recque 1979 Concei a o et al 1988 Chang et al 1992 Cainelli and Mohriak 1999 Moulin et al 2010 The South Atlantic Ocean can be divided into four long segments from North to South the Equatorial segment the Central segment the Austral Segment and the Falkland Segment The beginning of the rupture during the Jurassic occurred in the southern portion of the Austral Segment Popoff 1988 Torsvik et al 2009 Moulin et al 2010 In the Equatorial segment the movement of the continent to the north and northwest was impeded by the young oceanic lithosphere of the Central Atlantic Ocean Gulf of Mexico and proto-Caribbean Szat mari and Milani 2016 As a result from about 145 to 113 Ma the South Atlantic rift remained closed in the northwest along the Equatorial margin but widened wedge-like to the south along the South America s eastern margin As the rift widened the basaltic volcanism along the Ponta Grossa and Namibia dike swarms created the proto-Walvis Ridge which barred the access of ocean waters to the central South Atlantic rift from the South Szatmari and Milani 2016 Moulin et al 2010 reviewing the kinematics of the opening of the South Atlantic proposed that from 132 to 130 Ma the opening occurred between the Walvis Ridge and Pelotas Basin After 130 Ma and until Aptian the Santos block started to follow the general westward move ment of the southern part of South America playing the role of a kine matic buffer between the movements that created the northern Aptian basins Since the rift was also barred from the Central Atlantic Ocean in the northwest where the Equatorial margin had not yet rifted an endorheic lacustrine basin formed Szatmari and Milani 2016 Moreira et al 2007 divided the tectono-stratigraphic evolution of Santos Basin into rift post-rift and drift supersequences Fig 2 The basement of the Santos Basin is composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks from the Mantiqueira Province generated during the Neo proterozoic Brasiliano-Pan African Orogeny Almeida et al 1981 Heilbron et al 2004 The rift phase spans from Hauterivian to Early Aptian time Pereira and Feijo 1994 comprising the rocks of the Cambori Pi arras and Itapema Formations Figs 1D and 2 This phase is characterized by the development of rotated tilted-blocks and half-graben basins filled with thick sedimentary successions Milani et al 2007 Alves et al 2017 The Pi arras Formation deposited above the basaltic rocks of the Cambori Formation comprises alluvial sediments in proximal areas and shales of talc-stevensitic composition in lacustrine distal areas In contrast the Itapema Formation is composed of bivalve bioclastic rud stones concentrated on structural high domains and of lime mudstones and organic-matter rich shales in the distal parts of the basin Moreira et al 2007 From Barremian to Aptian in the Central segment the rift devel opment is characterized by lithospheric extension with block tilting in the inner upper continental crust and formation of small grabens 2 A M Almeida Carvalho et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 141 2022 105708 Fig 1 A Location of the Santos Basin in the

reservoir characterization of the Brazilian Santos Basin s pre-salt carbonates is a major challenge due to the faciological and depositional complexity providing high lateral and vertical heterogeneities and consequently the formation of static dynamic intraformational seals Regarding this context there is a massive pre-salt accumulation known as the Iara Cluster During the early development stage this cluster was split into three distinct accumulations named Berbiga o Sururu and Atapu This study aims to characterize the geological and hydrodynamic factors that affect the Iara Cluster reservoir compartmentalization To achieve this objective we applied an integrated analysis based on 3D seismic interpretation well logs pressure formation and fluid geochemistry analysis The spatial distribution of the reservoir range s five main seismic patterns indicates po tential stratigraphic-structural barrier zones The well log analysis correlated with formation pressure data enabled the identification of several irregular oil-water contacts and free water levels Small relative variations are associated with the perched-water phenomenon while large variations are related to compartmentalization The formation pressure analysis shows the hydraulic compartmentalization of the reservoirs in the Berbiga o Field Sururu and Atapu fields oil zones are possibly connected by a dynamic sealing zone or a common aquifer which provides a pressure balance on a geological time scale since their oil gradients are similar Our analyzes identified stratigraphic components in reservoir trapping associated with reservoir quality lateral obliteration Dissimilarities in the oil sample composition and properties indicate different petroleum charge histories along with the distinct CO2 contamination timing The Berbiga o oil-associated gas formed in earlier stages of matu ration than the Sururu and Atapu samples The results integration through a risk matrix revealed areas with a greater chance of compartmentalization and perched-water phenomenon Our study highlights the importance of multidisciplinary analysis to comprehend complex carbonate reservoirs connectivity and offers input to de-risk new ventures pre-salt reservoir quality 1 Introduction Understanding the spatial variations of reservoir properties and their consequences is a critical step in reservoir modeling Heterogeneities are mainly determined by the depositional environment in which the reservoir was formed as well as subsequent structural and diagenetic events Ahmed 2006 As a result of the heterogeneity a petroleum accumulation can be separated into individual fluid or pressure segments due to flow prevention across sealed reservoir boundaries Jolley et al 2010 These boundaries are divided into two categories static and dynamic seals The first are completely sealed and capable of trapping petroleum columns over geological time Dynamic seals are characterized by low to very low permeability flow baffles that reduce petroleum crossflow to infinitesimally slow rates allowing fluids and pressures to equilibrate across a boundary over geological time-scales but acting as seals over production time-scales Jolley et al 2010 Corresponding author E-mail address juliocsvital gmail com J C S Vital https doi org 10 1016 j marpetgeo 2023 106163 Received 17 November

151 2023 106163 Reservoir compartmentalization comprises one of the fundamental risks to the delivery of today s production and the development of up coming fields Fox and Bowman 2010 This phenomenon has an impact across the full exploration and production value chain from in-place volume estimation recoverable reserve evaluation and infrastructure planning to project economics Chen 2013 Therefore recognizing and comprehending reservoir compartmentalization during the appraisal or early stages of field development is critical in preventing asset value erosion by driving up costs or introducing significant development risk which can lead to project failure in extreme cases Fox and Bowman 2010 Due to the absence of dynamic production data identifying reservoir compartmentalization during early field history is challenging Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 requiring multi-disciplinary analysis to maxi mize the synergy of available static subsurface data The pre-production compartmentalization assessment has been proved to be assertive in case studies the most common static data used are variations of petro leum fingerprints and PVT properties Smalley and England 1994 Pe ters and Fowler 2002 Weissenburger and Borbas 2004 Milkov et al 2007 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 water geochemistry Gill et al 2010 Permanyer et al 2013 static reservoir pressure and

data McKie et al 2010 Scott et al 2010 Tozer and Borthwick 2010 Wonham et al 2010 Because no single static data set analysis can forecast the compartmentalization phenomenon a thorough inte gration of existing data is recommended to reduce and quantify reservoir connection uncertainty Milkov et al 2007 After 16 years of exploratory efforts more than 240 wells drilled and the discovery of one of the world s largest oil provinces the pre-salt play remains an extremely attractive business Mello et al 2021a However as exploration campaigns in the Santos Basin progressed the scenario became more challenging due to a decrease in more evident and low-risk opportunities Rostirolla et al 2021 necessitating a better under standing and awareness of the geological uncertainties surrounding the pre-salt exploratory play Among the causes of uncertainty for petro leum system elements proposed by Rostirolla et al 2021 reservoir heterogeneities and connectivity are one of the main factors affecting reservoir risk The aim of this paper is to comprehend the uncertainty and estimate the degree of compartmentalization in a complex carbonate reservoir of the Brazilian pre-salt play using pre-production static data To clarify this issue we used the intriguing Iara Cluster of the Santos Basin as a case study The pre-salt carbonate reservoirs are characterized by the faciological Wright and Barnett 2015 Abelha and Petersohn 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Azere do et al 2021 depositional Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Farias et al 2019 Minzoni et al 2021 de Carvalho et al 2021 Wright 2022 and diagenetic Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 complexity which is responsible for great lateral and vertical heterogeneities This scenario is susceptible to the formation of static and or dynamic intraformational seals which can act as flow barriers within the reservoir enabling the segregation of the hydrocar bon accumulation The method performed for compartmentalization modeling comprises the integration of a conceptual geological model of the Iara Cluster based on seismic facies interpretation with basic pet rophysical analysis geopressure fluid molecular composition and PVT properties interpretations Furthermore as an impact of low permeability zones several step ping oil-water contacts can coexist in the same reservoir segment in a static and stable manner due to the static perched-water effect Rolfsv g and Danielsen 2016 This phenomenon is defined as movable water above the transition zone that is not directly connected to the actual free-water table of a given hydrocarbon column and occurs when satu rated conditions above a low permeability layer force the water to move vertically Gaafar et al 2016 Similar to reservoir compartmentalization the implication of perched-water zones is the misunderstanding of reservoir behavior leading to an incorrect esti mation of stock tank oil in place reserve evaluation well placement and completion design all of which can cause the propagation of potential expenditure for field development Gaafar et al 2016 Rolfsv g and Danielsen 2016 Our study discusses the perched-water phenomenon in the same reservoir segment based on the recognition of significant over-pressured water zones Then the results and discussion raised by this study contribute to de-risking the reservoir quality in new explo ration ventures in stratigraphic-structural pre-salt prospects as well as reinforcing the importance of an integrated multidisciplinary evaluation of static data to predict the early field development reservoir segments and consequently prevent asset value erosion 2 Geological and exploratory background 2 1 The Iara Cluster The Iara Cluster is a massive pre-salt structure with more than 300 km2 of extension in the northeast portion of the Santos Basin Fig 1A which encompasses three of the biggest accumulations of the basin Sururu Berbiga o and Atapu The first exploratory efforts in this area started in June 2000 with the concession of the BM-S-11A block from the 2nd Bidding Round under the Concession Regime This was before the consolidation of the pre-salt as a play in the Santos Basin The block is currently operated by a consortium between Petrobras 42 5 Shell 25 Total 22 5 and Petrogal 10 Later in September 2008 the well 1-BRSA-618-RJS discovered the Sururu accumulation However at the time this discovery was interpreted as a non-segmented mega structure called Iara spanning the entirety of the Iara Cluster This was due to the poor quality of the seismic imaging and the almost complete absence of well data GaffneyCline 2010 In April 2012 the Berbiga o accumulation was discovered by the 3-BRSA-1032-RJS well Both of those accumulations extended outside the limits of the BM-S-11A block into an area not yet contracted Therefore the Brazilian government decided to include an additional block called Entorno de Iara Iara Surrounding covering this area Unlike the BM-S-11A block this block was contracted and operated by Petrobras directly under the transfer of rights regime Petrobras 2014 In May 2013 the Atapu accumulation was discovered by the 1-BRSA-1146-RJS well inside this new block Later an extension of this structure to the eastern area of the BM-S-11A block was confirmed by the 3-BRSA-1243-RJS well Petrobras 2014 The Brazilian government offered the Atapu ring fence through the transfer of rights surplus regime in 2021 which was acquired by a consortium formed by Petrobras 52 5 Total 22 5 and Shell 25 The Atapu ring fence is therefore subject to both the transfer of rights and the transfer of rights surplus regimes In summary as a result of the exploratory campaign in the Iara Cluster three different accumulations were discovered Berbiga o Sur uru and Atapu Petrobras 2014 Due to different kinds of E P regimes coexisting side-by-side these three accumulations ended up being divided into eight different ring fences for contractual reasons Fig 1B Berbiga o Sururu Oeste de Atapu West of Atapu Norte de Berbiga o North of Berbiga o Sul de Berbiga o South of Berbiga o Sul de Sururu South of Sururu Norte de Sururu North of Sururu and Atapu The first three ring fences are under a concession regime and the others are under a transfer of rights regime 2 2 General geological settings and tectono-stratigraphic evolution of presalt sequence The formation of the Santos Basin began in the Late Jurassic with the destabilization and consequent fragmentation of West Gondwana that resulted in the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean in the Early Creta ceous Heine et al 2013 Rigoti 2015 Dehler et al 2016 In this basin this process took place on a complex and heterogeneous basement 2 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Fig 1 A Iara Complex is located on the east-central portion of the Santos Basin in southeast Brazil B Ring fences of the fields brown and green polygons the area covered by the seismic data a grey polygon with the survey name R0302 Franco Florim and wells used in the study area identified as the Proterozoic Ribeira Belt which controlled the overall rifting architecture through structural inheritance Pereira and Macedo 1990 Milani et al 2005 Zalan et al 2011 Gomes et al 2012 Dehler et al 2016 Matos et al 2021 The structural framework of the basin is characterized by regional NE-trending normal faults affected by E-W strike-slip transfer zones and a regional sinistral shear zone that forms an S-shaped feature in the northeastern region of the Santos Basin Matos et al 2021 de Freitas et al 2022 The regional structural trend is again inflected to the NW-trend near the continent-ocean crustal transition Meisling et al 2001 with the fold axial trace located at the Boomerang structure Matos et al 2021 Based upon kinematic reconstruction methods Heine et al 2013 suggested a multi-phase and multi-directional extension history along the development of the South Atlantic rift characterized in the Santos Basin by a general oblique extension and rifting This obliquity enabled the formation of regional transfer zones that compartmentalized this basin Meisling et al 2001 as well as induced the formation of asso ciated strike-slip structures Souza 2008 Stanton et al 2014 Dehler et al 2016 identified a regional magnetic anomaly named Helmut which is interpreted as a crustal-scale sinistral transtensive shear zone system active during the Late Aptian that affected the structural framework of the basin This event possibly produced changes in fault ing regimes formed several loci of transpression or transtension fea tures rotated basement blocks and affected crustal thinning and thickening processes The Santos basin-fill history starts in the upper Valanginian Hau terivian with the deposition of basalts from the Camboriu Formation representing the economic basement and records the first signs of the West Gondwana fragmentation During the early stages of the rift in the Barremian age the half-grabens were filled by non-marine deposits from the Pi arras Formation which is characterized by lacustrine sandstones siltstones and talc-stevensitic shales Moreira et al 2007 Carlotto et al 2017 From the Neobarremian until the Eoaptian the Itapema Formation was deposited in a lacustrine environment and it is composed of the intercalation of coquinas bivalve rudstone grainstone wackestone and packstone and black shale Moreira et al 2007 Carlotto et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 Extensive clinoforms succession with more than 100 3 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 m thick of coquinas was identified in Mero Field and interpreted by Barnett et al 2020 as a large bar produced through the reworking of bivalves from lower energy depositional environments by shore-parallel currents Such deposits comprise the best reservoir facies shown by well 2-ANP-2A-RJS Carlotto et al 2017 The top of the Itapema Formation is marked by a regional unconformity in the Santos Basin known as the Pre-Alagoas Unconformity Moreira et al 2007 During the Aptian and within the Brazilian Alagoas Stage the main pre-salt carbonate reservoirs of the Santos Basin were deposited belonging to the Barra Velha Formation BVE This formation is mainly lacustrine in origin and characterized by exotic carbonate texture as sociation which consists of in-situ components described as fascicular calcite crystal shrubs calcite spherulites and mud as well as reworked facies derived from those carbonates Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Wright and Barnett 2017a Microbialites have also been described in the Barra Velha Formation However these facies are considered rare and are mainly located in the uppermost 20 30m of the formation Wright and Barnett 2015 2017a 2020 In addition in distal portions there is a predominance of shales and mudstones Moreira et al 2007 as evidenced by the well 1-BRSA-886-RJS with 300 m of continuous shale located in the flank of the main depocenter of the Santos Basin de Freitas et al 2022 There is also an intra-formational unconformity named Intra-Alagoas Unconformity dated 117 Ma based on the Ar Ar method in synchronous basaltic lava flow deposits Moreira et al 2007 Whilst in the top of this formation there is an unconformity that precedes the evaporites of the Ariri For mation named Salt Base characterized by an intense erosion process as described by Alves et al 2017 Magmatic events have been identified along all the pre-salt sequence in the Santos Basin in addition to the Valanginian Hauterivian basalts of the Cambori Formation subaqueous basalts are identified inter bedded with sedimentary rocks in the Pi arras and Itapema formations dated between 121 and 130 Ma and in the lower Barra Velha Formation dated at 128 Ma Moreira et al 2007 In the Libra Block Rancan et al 2018 and Penna et al 2019 identified different igneous suites with different ages and natures the first one comprises predominantly Bar remian Aptian tholeiitic basalts placed mostly in the Itapema Formation dated based on 40Ar 39Ar at 125 5 0 7 Ma whilst the second one comprises Santonian Campanian intrusive alkaline hypabyssal rocks placed predominantly on the top of the Barra Velha Formation and locally in the Itapema Formation In summary Fig 2 presents a simplified chronostratigraphic chart for the Iara Cluster 2 3 The Barra Velha formation depositional setting The genesis of the Barra Velha Formation and the Macabu Forma tion its equivalent in the Campos Basin has been the subject of intense debate in the geoscientific community owing to its unusual carbonate texture considerable thickness and the lack of more typical carbonate lake deposits Muniz and Bosence 2015 2018 Wright and Barnett 2015 2017a 2017b 2020 Wright and Tosca 2016 Ceraldi and Grenn 2017 Chafetz et al 2018 Pietzsch et al 2018 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 Azere do et al 2021 Barnett et al 2021a b de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 Most studies published agree about the overall depositional settings characterized by the non-marine alkaline lakes However as pointed out by Azere do et al 2021 some points still have not reached consensus among geoscientists such as a the origin of carbonate fabric whether it is biotic biotic-induced or abiotic b lake settings and their evolution over time c carbonate rock terminology and classification d genesis and significance of spherulites and the Mg-rich clays The pre-salt carbonates of the Santos Basin were deposited in a continentally proportioned lacustrine setting that exceeds the area of the modern-lake Lake Tanganyika the largest rift lake in the world Pietzsch et al 2018 This palaeolake is defined as a closed endorheic environ ment Szatmari and Milani 2016 Farias et al 2019 which evolved for a long time completely disconnected from the oceans basically controlled by the catchment areas and subsurface recharge system input Pietzsch et al 2018 Inferences based on the use of seismic-scale ge ometries such as clinoforms and draping as depositional relief proxies indicate significant bathymetry at the time of BVE carbonate deposition Buckley et al 2015 Minzoni et al 2021 In general large lacustrine systems can mimic the sequence-stratigraphic architecture of marine settings except for the details of carbonate components and perhaps high-frequency stratigraphy Minzoni et al 2021 Taking this into consideration Minzoni et al 2021 suggested that the primary controls on the large-scale depositional architecture of continental carbonates from the Barra Velha Formation are the antecedent topography subsi dence patterns palaeowind direction and the production rate of the

Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 carbonate factory which is affected by the carbonated fabric type and mainly the fluctuations in lake-water chemistry On this basis Fetter et al 2018 highlighted the importance of the balance between the carbonate factory keep up and tectonic uplift related to elastic rebound and transpression features to control the depositional architecture of this palaeolake In the Santos Basin the complex basement topography framework derived from the multi-phase oblique rift Zalan et al 2011 Rigoti 2015 process was induced by inheritance and reactivation controlling the architecture of the carbonate systems and consequently contrib uting to the control of its facies deposition Buckley et al 2015 Minzoni et al 2021 The carbonate sediments of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations were accumulated in shallow waters upon or around struc tural palaeohighs within a deep lacustrine depositional context where profundal facies were deposited on the structural depressions Buckley et al 2015 Fetter et al 2018 Neves et al 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Minzoni et al 2021 In contrast based on petrographic and geochemical analysis some studies Wright and Barnett 2015 2017b Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Wright 2022 Farias et al 2019 suggest an overspread shallow evaporitic and alkaline lake model for the Barra Velha Formation disregarding its possible rugged palaeotopography during deposition This interpretation is mainly supported by the regional correlation of the BVE shallow water facies characterized by the gamma ray log pattern known as Lula s Fingers or Marco Tupi observed in several wells across the Santos Basin which comprise on average 24 3 m defined by 9 gamma-defined cycles and interpreted as one or more shallowing-upward cyclothems Wright and Barnett 2017a 2017b Wright 2022 However two possible pitfalls can be addressed in this model a this model can be easily biased since the pre-salt wells in those studies are derived from the structural highs of the Santos Basin which are related to shallow-water platform settings owing to the current pre-salt exploratory play Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 b the Marco Tupi facies are not related to the envi ronment described in the majority of the BVE carbonates and probably represent another depositional sequence associated with modified wa ters related to the first marine inflow in the basin de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 In addition Wright 2022 points out potential dif ficulties in interpreting seismic features due to the high structural complexity observed in basins containing BVE carbonates and their equivalents Among the processes mentioned Wright 2022 the extension discrepancy and polyphase faulting the effects of an outer margin collapse during the late Albian and the reactivation and sub sequent inversion of faults Alves et al 2017 could trigger a posterior deformation producing a relief at the top of the BVE unit which could be confused with depositional relief Despite the challenges behind the BVE and MCB carbonate charac terization and interpretation major advances have been made in the last decade Many studies Muniz and Bosence 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Tosca 2016 Gomes et al 2020 Azere do et al 2021 de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Wright 2022 described the high-frequency cyclical nature of these deposits which in general are characterized by a shallowing upward-increasing shrub stacking pattern composed of a transition from mudstone to spherulitestone and respectively to shrubstone Gomes et al 2020 and eventually to grainstones due to reworking processes Gomes et al 2020 based on the Farias et al 2019 model proposed a shallowing spherulite upward increasing facies stacking pattern in which the shrubstone facies tran sition to spherulitestone with Mg-clay facies In order to explain the coexistence of both facies stacking pattern models Gomes et al 2020 interpreted that these variations are the result of the balance between the sedimentary input and the lake chemistry in different climatic con ditions the first being related to the transition from a humid to an arid environment and the second to a semi-arid to arid environment Regardless the divergence of palaeobathymetric and depositional interpretation related to the BVE lake settings the published models converge approximately in relation to the spatial gross facies distribution Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Grenn 2017 de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 Whilst on the relative structural high position prevails the presence of reworked facies shrubs dominated sedimentary facies and travertine on the low structural position there is the occurrence of spherulite dominated facies mudstones and even shales according to the prevalence of rela tive deeper water settings 2 4 Hydrothermal activity evidence on pre-salt carbonates Hydrothermal systems are sets of processes that redistribute energy and mass in the earth through the circulation of hot fluids laterally and vertically at various temperatures and pressures Norton 1984 Pirajno 1992 Pirajno 2009 The circulation of such hydrothermal fluids pro duces a complex process involving physico-chemical changes in preex isting rocks known as hydrothermal alteration Pirajno 2009 Pirajno 1992 Other results of hydrothermal activity are subaerial and sub aqueous hot springs common in volcanic and tectonic lakes as well as on the seafloor along mid-ocean ridges and in volcanic islands Those sys tems occur in areas of high geothermal gradients due to ongoing or re sidual magmatic or anomalous crustal conditions and as a result of anomalous heat flow due to high concentrations of radioactive elements in the crust Pirajno 2009 In continental settings those springs can produce travertine depositional environments related to hydrothermal vents fissure ridges rimstone dams pools and terrace features as well as tufa depositional environments Jones and Renaut 2010 de Filippis and Billi 2012 Renaut et al 2013 Mancini et al 2019 Evidence of syn and late hydrothermal systems has been reported in pre-salt settings of the Santos and Campos Basins Alvarenga et al 2016 Herlinger Jr et al 2017 de Luca et al 2017 Oliveira and Rancan 2018 Lima and De Ros 2019 Lima et al 2020 The first piece of evidence is the hydrothermal alteration observed in the carbonates of the Barra Velha Ren et al 2019 and Macabu de Luca et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Lima et al 2020 formations characterized by hydraulic fracturing silicification dolomitization dissolution and precipitation of hydrothermal mineral phases such as saddle dolomite macrocrystalline calcite megaquartz sulfides and sulfates filling sec ondary porosity Lima et al 2020 due to the interaction between the hot fluids focused by fault systems and the preexisting rocks In northern Campos Basin based on petrographic characterization fluid inclusion analyses and isotopic analysis Lima et al 2020 identified a late-stage deep-burial hydrothermal alteration in carbonates related to the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene magmatic events and possibly the rising and exhumation of the asthenosphere in addition to the interaction with the granitic-gneissic basement and the rift sedimentary succession In the northern Santos Basin Ren et al 2019 identified a hydrothermal alteration related to the existence of a multi-stage magmatism mainly associated with Aptian and Santonian-Campanian magmatic events through hydrothermal minerals and fluid inclusion analysis The second piece of evidence is hydrothermal vent systems that are defined by pipe-like complexes formed by the fracturing transporting and erupting of hydrothermal fluids and sediments Planke et al 2005 These depositional features occur in association with travertine conti nental rift systems as observed in Lake Bogoria in the Kenya Rift Valley Renaut et al 2013 Those features are seismic-scale and their recognition was discussed by Planke et al 2005 and Hansen 2006 which defined the seismic pattern of this structure related to intrusive events Hydrothermal vents have been broadly identified in the sedi mentary basins of the Brazilian eastern margin at different stratigraphic levels including in the pre-salt section of the Campos and Santos basins Alvarenga et al 2016 identified several intrusive-related hydrother mal vent complexes in the rift section of the Campos Basin Central platform Oliveira et al 2018 identified those complexes in the Eocene interval of the Esp rito Santo onshore basin possibly related to the Abrolhos magmatic event Oliveira and Rancan 2018 also identified these features in the Aptian interval in the northern portion of the Santos

prop erties and fluids with similar fingerprints Milkov et al 2007 The first analysis performed consisted of the interpretation of seis mically imaged faults unconformities and seismic facies to comprehend the Iara structure in the pre-salt interval The seismic interpretation was based on the identification and tracking of seismic reflectors correlated with key pre-salt unconformities registered in well logs considering the amplitude continuity and reflector terminations The seismic facies were defined by the external geometry and reflection configuration identified and subsequently compared with seismic patterns described previously in the bibliography such as Mitchum et al 1977 Buckley et al 2015 Kattah and Balabekov 2015 Alvarenga et al 2016 Saller et al 2016 Ferreira et al 2019 Minzoni et al 2021 and Ferreira et al 2021 We carried out this analysis on two scales a Semi-Regional - in this step-the basement and base of salt discontinuities were interpreted throughout the seismic volume in order to understand the structural and depositional context of the target of this study b Detailed -in this stage-beyond the interpretation of the Pre-Salt key unconformities such as the base of salt Intra-Alagoas Unconformity and Pre-Alagoas Un conformity the recognitions and description of seismic facies was per formed as well as the analysis of RMS Amplitude Sweetness Variance and Isochore maps extracted from the surfaces mentioned The Base of Salt was interpreted as a high amplitude reflector characterized by a positive acoustic impedance reflector with high lateral continuity sparsely affected by faults which can be correlated regionally The Intra-Alagoas Unconformity is a high positive amplitude fairly continuous moderately affected by faults and appears conform able in some palaeodepressions The Pre-Alagoas Unconformity corre sponds to a low to medium amplitude discontinuous reflector intensively affected by faults The key seismic patterns identified in this study are illustrated and characterized in Table 1 Environmental setting depositional processes and lithology esti mation can be interpreted through the three-dimensional relationship between seismic patterns Mitchum et al 1977 On this basis a con ceptual geological model of the Iara Cluster was created derived from the integration of the spatial distribution of the seismic facies associa tions observed throughout the Barra Velha formation geometry of the main unconformities and lacustrine carbonate depositional environ ment analogs described in Santos Campos and Kwanza Basin Saller et al 2016 Ceraldi and Grenn 2017 de Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 This model was used to 3 Data and methods 3 1 Dataset and quality control The project database consists of a 3D-seismic cube and data from 17 wells provided by the Exploration and Production Data Bank BDEP from the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels ANP The arrangement and location of the data used in this study are illustrated in Fig 1 The post-stack depth-domain seismic volume used in this study covers 3709 km2 including the Iara pre-salt cluster Itapu as well as parts of the B zios Mero and Se pia Oil Fields The average seismic resolution observed in the pre-salt section is approximately 68 m Despite the presence of noise features such as diffraction geometries and acquisition footprints the volume in general expresses a good image quality enabling the recognition and interpretation of the main seismic patterns meeting the objectives of this work In addition we carried out a basic preconditioning workflow based on structural smoothing and filtering to improve the signal-to noise ratio Of the 17 wells eleven are exploratory wells and the others are development wells The data used were well logs rock and fluid sample reports and when available basic petrophysical data reports We per formed a calibration of the Salt Base between the seismic surface and the formation tops This is necessary due to the uncertainty in the velocity processing model used to migrate the data The maximum and minimum deviations estimated are 64 and 60 m respectively with an average value of 21 7 m Moreover we correlated four wells from Iara s accu mulations with the seismic yielding a detailed analysis of the seismic facies 3 2 Methodology Reservoir compartmentalization modeling is a multidisciplinary approach to identify and characterize fluid units baffles and barriers within a reservoir before production Smalley and Hale 1996 Edman and Burk 1999 Raba a and Nagel 2004 Milkov et al 2007 Jolley et al 2010 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 Chen 2013 In this study this workflow incorporates the integration of two main analyses the seismic interpretation and the formation evaluation Fig 3 For non-segmented reservoirs with a low risk of flow barriers between two wells we can expect no abrupt change in reservoir properties Fig 3 Schematic flowchart used in this study containing the main analyses performed 6 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Table 1 Iara Cluster carbonate seismic facies SF classification summary and interpretation qualitatively estimate the distribution of the large-scale lithofacies variations and faults which are potential permeability barriers Observations of fluid-related properties in different parts of the reservoir provide supporting evidence that there are physical barriers to the oil flow Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 Then the second step of this study consisted of a formation evaluation which encompassed qualitative analysis of well logs geopressure data analysis PVT prop erties and composition evaluation of fluids The well logs analysis enabled the identification of vertical permeability barrier zones and petroleum-water contact The geopressure analysis used point static pressure measurements acquired by the modular formation dynamic tester MDT tool from eleven exploratory wells that tested the reservoir in virgin conditions enabling the estimation of fluid gradients and free-water levels FWL In addition we analyzed 33 differential liber ation PVT property reports and 26 flash-liberation PVT compositional analysis reports obtained via gas chromatography These reports con tained restricted data on the molecular composition and the fluid physical properties enabling a basic comparison between oils sampled in different wells Upon analysis there were only five carbon and hydrogen isotopic data from methane samples present in this dataset No individual analysis can provide a reliable prediction of reservoir compartmentalization Smalley and Hale 1996 Edman and Burk 1999 Raba a and Nagel 2004 Milkov et al 2007 Jolley et al 2010 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 Chen 2013 therefore a thorough integration 7 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 of the data available and models built were performed in order to reduce uncertainties in the reservoir compartmentalization evaluation and es timate the potential flow barrier and baffle locations The integration tool applied in this study was the compartmentalization risk matrix CRM proposed by Milkov et al 2007 well as immediately next to the Iracema Fault System which is the NE-trending continuity of the Outer Santos High Master Fault System Gomes et al 2012 The pre-salt section is deposited in grabens half-grabens and horsts underneath a thick evaporite sequence that exceeds 3 km in thickness As a result of a complex oblique-sinistral extensional system locally represented by the sinistral shear zone related to the Helmut Anomaly Dehler et al 2016 the structural framework Fig 4 of this basin s segment is characterized by the in flection of the regional NE NNE trend observed in the Itapu Field to the overall NW trend in the Iara Cluster location which rotates back to the NE trend in the south near the Se pia Field The structural inflection areas exhibit a large-scale flexural folding geometry conditioned by the 4 Results 4 1 Semi-Regional structural context of Iara Cluster The Iara Cluster is

setting whilst the Sururu structure is in an interme diary zone Fig 5A Despite the influence of lower order cycles and post-depositional fault systems there is a positive correlation between the Pre -Alagoas Unconformity depth at present-day and the mudcarbonate proportion ratio gathered from the composite logs Fig 5B Thus further fault activity in general preserved the overall stratigraphic architecture of the Iara Cluster during the Jiquia Stage in which deeper lake water conditions prevailed in Berbiga o and the western portion of Sururu whilst at the structural highs of the Sururu and Atapu shallower lake water setting prevailed enabling the deposition of coquina banks Fig 5A The Pre -Alagoas Unconformity is predominantly conformable with the superior reflectors however there are local vestiges of erosion defined by angular and erosional truncation In the study area this seismic unit correlated with the Itapema interval is predominantly characterized by subhorizontal to horizontal parallel seismic patterns associated to continuous and high amplitude SF 1B in the Berbiga o and in the western Sururu low-angle clinoform seismic patterns asso ciated to semicontinuous to continuous related to downlap termination and moderate amplitude SF-3 near the well 3-BRSA-891A-RJS location in the southern slope of the Sururu and intensive sequence thinning associated to semiparallel to wavy seismic pattern and discontinuous reflectors with moderate to low amplitude on the top of the Atapu structure structural inheritance of the Proterozoic dextral transpressional Ribeira belt as shown by Matos et al 2021 This configuration results in a regional S -shaped structural architecture in the eastern Santos Basin that is strongly influenced by a strike-slip component The Iara Cluster comprises a vast four-way structural closure at the Aptian level composed by three internal pre-salt structural highs known as Berbiga o Sururu and Atapu separated from each other by extensive grabens associated with local relay ramps The regional bimodal struc tural framework trend is represented in the Iara Cluster two fault families are clearly observed characterized by a main NW-trend asso ciated with a subordinate NE-trend Fig 4 Despite the proximity of the fields a distinct structural architecture is observed The Berbiga o structural framework is mainly characterized by a depressed basement relief with thick syn-rift filling associated with NW-trending rotated hemigrabens with NE dip directions moreover secondary antithetic faults and NE-trending faults are observed including NE sinistral strikeslip transfer faults The Sururu structural framework comprises an intermediary basement relief characterized by a sequence of interca lated NE-trending horsts and grabens highly associated with relay ramps The Atapu accumulation is situated on top of an expressive rhombohedral-shaped basement structural high formed by a trans pressive uplift caused by the accommodation of oblique rifting faults in the Helmut sinistral shear zone settings In the study area syn and post-deposition faults were identified affecting all of the pre-salt sequence The Itapema formation and lower rift intervals are structurally most affected indicating high tectonic activity Moreover expressive reactivated faults and growth faults were identified affecting the lower and upper Barra Velha formations indi cating the concomitance between sedimentary filling and structural activity Therefore the tectonic subsidence and its lateral variations along fault families were an important control of the BVE exotic car bonate deposition and facies distribution in Iara Cluster and conse quently in lateral variation of reservoir quality The reactivation of preexisting faults caused the structural inversion of certain fault families mainly in the Berbiga o and Sururu regions as well as at the inflection point of the regional structural trend as in the northwest of Atapu 4 2 2 Barra Velha formation The lower Barra-Velha formation was sampled by all the wells in this study and is defined by the first occurrence of in-situ carbonates Minzoni et al 2021 The few petrography reports available in the dataset describe the predominance of mudstone-spherulitestone inter calation in this interval regardless of the wells structural position The upper limit of this unit is characterized by the Intra-Alagoas Unconfor mity IAU which is represented by a regional trackable positive amplitude reflector The IAU structural map varies between 5140 and 6800 m and dis plays the same structural trend as the PAU structural map Fig 6A The thickness of the Lower Barra Velha formation Fig 6B varies greatly along the structural framework indicating the importance of tectonic control on the deposition and consequently in the facies distribution The highest values of thickness are associated with growth strata whereas the lowest values are related to erosional settings mainly observed in Berbiga o and Atapu The seismic unit corresponding to the Lower Barra Velha Formation is characterized by the lack of continuity and low amplitude contrast of seismic reflectors even resulting in a reflection-free seismic pattern Fig 7 However locally there are continuous parallel patterns asso ciated with a medium to high amplitude in the Berbiga o Field and the western portion of the Sururu Field Also there are semiparallel discontinuous seismic patterns associated with onlap reflector termi nations in the northwestern portion of the Atapu Field The absence of seismic pattern diversity in the lower Barra Velha Formation could be associated with the facies homogeneity as shown by the petrography reports The co-rendering of the amplitude seismic with the cosine of the phase attribute

upper Barra Velha Formation comprises the interval above the IAU and is limited by the Base of Salt unconformity Moreira et al 2007 Buckley et al 2015 Carlotto et al 2017 Minzoni et al 2021 Ac cording to the petrography reports this unit mainly comprises a com plex stratigraphic succession characterized by cycles of in-situ carbonates defined by mudstones spherulitestone shrubstone and reworked

detailed interpretation and classification of seismic patterns differentiated by geometry and reflection character five main seismic facies were identified Tabular Mound Bank Chaotic Lens Filling There are important variations in the tabular seismic unit in relation to its structural position which motivated its subdivision Other seismic patterns with a smaller regional scope such as karst features were also recognized but were not mapped due to their scale The main seismic facies recognized and mapped of the Iara Cluster are summa rized in Table 1 4 2 1 Itapema Formation The Itapema Formation was sampled in 15 wells 4 in Berbiga o 3 in Sururu and 8 in Atapu As shown in previous work Moreira et al 2007 Carlotto et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 the Itapema Formation is constituted by the intercalation of coquinas and shales mudstones The transition between this unit and the Barra Velha Formation is defined by a funnel gamma ray pattern related to the occurrence of shales infor mally known as Jiquia in the most radioactive portion or by the occurrence of coquinas which is defined by a cylindrical gamma ray pattern De Freitas et al 2022 analyzed the organic geochemistry of well samples in the Santos Basin including the 1-BRSA-618-RJS 3-BRSA-891A-RJS and 3-BRSA-1172-RJS from Sururu and Atapu fields and pointed out a high source rock interval potential with high content of TOC up to 15 9 and kerogen type I related to the Jiquia member interval The Jiquia Stage was highly affected and controlled by the tectonic activity related to the rift phase of the Santos Basin shaping the Iara 9 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Fig 5 A Map of the Pre-Alagoas Unconformity containing gross rock facies pie-charts of Itapema Formation B Scatterplot between Mud-Carbonate Ratio and SSTVD in meters showing a low correlation trend in a grey line travertine The Base of Salt BS structural map varies between 6470 and 4880 m and introduces the mounded seismic features along the NW align ment trend or as an isolated geometry Fig 8A The thickness of the upper Barra Velha Fig 8B also varies greatly along the structural framework The highest values of thickness are associated in this in terval with mound seismic facies and growth strata features whereas the lowest values are related to erosional settings mainly in the Atapu Field The seismic interval corresponding to this unit is characterized by a high diversity of seismic patterns Figs 9 and 10 The most outstanding seismic features observed in the Iara Cluster are the carbonate mounds which are characterized by mounded external geometry associated with low amplitude contrast and chaotic or convex internal reflections This feature is deeply structurally controlled occurring mainly along the major fault systems in the border of horsts forming and producing mound ridges or an isolated mound The aggradational stacking pattern and thickening of the BVE interval along these structures indicate the synchronicity between the fault activity and the carbonate deposition The height of the identified mounds varies between 120 and 360 m with 275 m as the mean value On the top of the structural highs there is a predominance of tabular external geometry associated with wavy to horizontal semiparallel continuous seismic reflection with low to moderate amplitude Figs 9 and 10 SF-1B The tabular geometry seismic pattern also occurs in the structural lows but with higher amplitude contrast and a highly parallel continuous seismic pattern SF-1A as clearly observed in the Berbiga o structure Fig 9 The transition between these two seismic patterns occurs abruptly either associated with faults or through slope-related seismic patterns such as progradational clinoforms SF-3 and filling features SF-4 The clinoforms are steep 15 achieving 60 locally in some areas and their profiles are predominately sigmoidal and obliqueparallel Some authors suggest a dominance of reworked coarse-grained sediments or in-situ boundstone accumulation on the upper slope of this feature Buckley et al 2015 Ferreira et al 2019 2021 Minzoni et al 2021 The recognition and spatial delimitation of external filling seismic geometry were determinants for inferring significant lateral variation of depositional facies in the upper Barra Velha Lake System These features in the lower slopes are characterized by an onlap front slope fill indi cating a retrogradational stacking pattern with a predominance of relatively deeper lake deposits We identified possible pool features through the fill geometry at the top of the platform The distal basins associated with the post-slope front fill setting are characterized by a high amplitude parallel seismic pattern therefore amplitude attributes 10 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Fig 6 A The Intra-Alagoas Unconformity map for the Iara structure which represents the top of the lower Barra Velha formation B The lower Barra Velha formation thickness map and the thickness distribution in meters Note the fault influence on the deposition of the Barra Velha formation encompassing the formation thickening toward the active fault wall and the thinning of structurally higher portions due to erosion are important tools for the spatial delimitation of this feature Further more the spatial distribution of these elements indicates an asymmetric large-scale architecture margin in eastern Sururu Fig 7 which is a possible result of the windward-leeward effect Minzoni et al 2021 4 3 2 2 pressure-volume-temperature PVT properties and fluid sample composition The comparison of reservoir fluid composition and properties can indicate dissimilarity between reservoir fluid segments Furthermore understanding how fluid properties vary in depth is essential for esti mating post-accumulation processes such as gravitational segregation and fluid displacement On this basis we interpreted PVT properties and composition data derived from downhole fluid samples wireline for mation tests and extended well tests This analysis supported the observed complexity between Iara reservoirs Table 3 The Berbiga o Sururu and Atapu reservoirs contain oil with associated gas There is no clear evidence of gradational segregation in the Atapu and North Berbiga o reservoirs since there is no clear trend in API gravity variations with depth which vary mainly from 26 to 30 API The fluid samples from the South Berbiga o accumulation well show variations In the Sururu Field a clear slight decrease in these values is observed with depth ranging from 21 5 to 27 5 API which may be a callsign for gradational segregation Fig 12 There is a strong distinction between the saturation pressure signa tures of the reservoirs studied Berbiga o samples show low values with small variations related to well 4-BRSA-1226-RJS Table 3 The Sururu samples present intermediate values with strong variation conditioned by the increase in depth Fig 12B The Atapu samples on the other hand show higher values with low variability with the exception of a sample from the 3-BRSA-1172-RJS wells which is an accumulation in the reservoirs of the Itapema formation The saturation pressure presents a strong positive correlation with Bo therefore in short Berbiga o pre sents lower values than Sururu which in turn presents lower values than Atapu Fig 12C The solubility ratio Rs exhibits a strong positive correlation with the saturation pressure Fig 13E Thus this property also shows important distinctions between Iara structures Fig 13A The Berbiga o reservoirs have the lowest values for this property referring to 76 m3 std m3 std However despite the lack of data density the values from 4 3 Formation evaluation 4 3 1 Integrated pressure survey analysis The initial pressure of the Iara Cluster reservoirs is greater than the bubble-point pressure therefore it is classified as an undersaturated oil reservoir and exhibits a single liquid hydrocarbon phase In order to evaluate the communication between the Iara Cluster fields a detailed geopressure plot analysis was performed and calibrated with some well fluid samples Thereafter based on the resistivity log integrated with NMR porosity curves and gamma ray the oil-water contact was esti mated The result of this analysis is summarized in Table 2 The field consolidated formation geopressure plot Fig 10 indicates that the Sururu and Atapu reservoirs have similar oil gradients 0 0785Kgf cm2 m and 0 0777 Kgf cm2 m On the other hand not all of Berbiga o s structures are connected in the same oil zone as two oil gradients were clearly observed Fig 11A The main one is slightly different from those of the Sururu and Atapu fields 0 0809 Kgf cm2 m while the second one obtained by the well 3-BRSA-1032-RJS is quite different 0 0989 Kgf cm2 m Furthermore different water gradients and consequently free water levels related to the main oil gradients of the Berbiga o and Atapu fields were observed In general they present similar water gradients around 0 1125 Kgf cm2 m and are parallelly shifted in depth This arrangement forms a horse-tail shape in the plot Fig 11D It is noteworthy that due to the high clay content in the Sururu Field water zone there were few reliable pressure sampling points in this interval impairing the estimation of the water gradient by linear regression but the free-water level was qualitatively estimated by the arrangement of the dataset 11 J C S Vital et al Marine and

structural lows present plane-parallel reflectors with strong amplitude contrast that onlaps over inclined reflectors analogous to clinoforms located on slopes At the top of the platform semi-parallel reflectors with lower amplitude contrast are observed there is also the effect of reactivated faults on the deposition of the Barra Velha formation the well 4-BRSA-1226-RJS can indicate an increasing gradient toward the top of the reservoir The Sururu reservoirs have a wide intermediary distribution ranging from 123 to 217 m3std m3std with a clearly negative correlation trend between the Rs and depth which corrobo rates the gradational segregation indicated in the API gravity plot The highest values are observed in the Atapu reservoirs at 241 m3std m3std The only exception is the oil sample from the Itapema reservoir section of well 3-BRSA-1172-RJS which shows lower values of Rs and all other properties indicating a possible local vertical fluid compartmentaliza tion in the Atapu Field related to the Jiquia shale sealing behavior There is different CO2 contamination content associated with the gas phase of those oil accumulations Fig 13B The Berbiga o reservoirs have the lowest contamination ranging from 0 1 to 3 37 There is a slight internal variation since southern Berbiga o well 4-BRSA-1226RJS shows decreasing CO2 contamination with depth indicating local compositional gradation while the other wells do not show a clear trend despite having a slight difference between them The Sururu reservoirs have high variability of CO2 content ranging from 23 5 to 33 5 associated with a negative correlation also indicating compositional gradation With the exception of the sample from the Itapema reservoir 12 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023

throughout the geological history the growth of carbonate mounds during the deposition of the upper BVE and its expressive relative thickening in the Atapu Field well 3-BRSA-1172-RJS there is a low variability of CO2 contamination ranging from 27 to 30 with no correlation observed The C1 content in the reservoir fluid per depth plot Fig 13C ex hibits the same patterns discussed above reinforcing the clearly observed compositional gradient in the Sururu reservoirs The only exception is observed in the Berbiga o reservoirs which exhibit an in crease in C1 values with depth and a dispersed relative distribution This unexpected trend may be related to the existence of fluid compart mentalization between the three locations drilled since the Southern Berbiga o 4-BRSA-1226-RJS has higher values than the Western Berbiga o 3-BRSA-1032-RJS which in turn has higher values than the Eastern Berbiga o 3-BRSA-1132-RJS The PVT compositional analysis through gas chromatography points out internal dissimilarities between the wells mainly in the Berbiga o and Sururu reservoirs as well as external differences between the Iara oilfields Fig 14 In general Berbiga o reservoirs have a higher content of C2 C20 compounds and lower values of C1 and CO2 in relation to the other fields Dissimilarities of hydrocarbon compounds between Berbiga o wells are mostly clear in the C1 C3 interval and C20 The reservoir fluid components of Sururu and Atapu are quite similar except for the C20 and the interval C12 C16 The oil sample from the Itapema Reservoir s Atapu field collected from well 3-BRSA-1172-RJS is different from the other samples collected in Atapu corroborating the local ver tical oil pool segmentation hypothesis in this field Furthermore internal dissimilarities in the Sururu field are also clear in the C12 C16 interval and in the C20 The ascending gradational aspect observed in the C20 peak in south Berbiga o corroborates the hypothesis of gradational segregation 4

acquired by well 9-BRSA-1212-RJS showing 39 051 of 13C C1 and -150 902 of 2H C1 The Atapu samples were acquired in wells 1-BRSA-1146-RJS and 4-BRSA-1284-RJS which show very low variability between them the values obtained for 13C C1 are respec tively - 38 256 and 38 365 while for 2H C1 they are 145 128 and 145 185 5 Discussion 5 1 Iara Cluster conceptual geological model Overlapping the structurally rugged relief of the Iara Complex sub strate the Itapema Formation Barremian to Aptian was deposited mostly associated with a deep lacustrine system which resulted in the prevalence of shales and mudstones along the Berbiga o hemigrabens and the Sururu horst and graben systems Fig 5 However the high relative position of some palaeohorsts enabled the formation of a highenergy shallower lake water system that produced coquina bank 13 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Fig 9 SW-NE seismic line through the Iara Cluster with an emphasis on the lower

Interpretation of seismic facies showing the architecture of the BVE Note the radical difference in the spatial distribution of seismic facies throughout the Iara Cluster In Berbiga o structure prevails the contrast of high-amplitude parallel seismic unit SF-1A and the carbonate mounds there is also the remarkable erosion of the lower BVE footwall and the thickening of hangingwall In Sururu an overall tabular geometry prevails with a lower amplitude parallel seismic unit SF 1B and a downstepping seismic unit SF-3 associated with faults A major syn-hemigraben separates the Sururu and Atapu structures in which the contrast of carbonate mounds SF-2 and a lower-amplitude seismic unit SF 1B prevails deposits mainly in the Atapu Field and also locally in the Sururu Field Fig 5 At the top of the Itapema Formation in the Atapu Field there is the occurrence of a highly radioactive shale This shale a k a the Jiquia member is interestingly important because it not only presents a high source rock potential with a high dispersion throughout the area de Freitas et al 2022 but it can also function as a seal segmenting vertically different oil composition pools Fig 14 Furthermore there are occurrences of clinoforms SF 3B related to the Itapema Formation in the northwest and southeast of the Sururu slopes Fig 7 morpho logically analogous to the Mero Field Carlotto et al 2017 Oliveira

seismic facies showing the architecture of the BVE Note the internal complexity of the Atapu spatial dis tribution of seismic facies the northwest portion is characterized by the north carbonate mound system with internal downstepping reflection pattern and associates collapse feature the tabular parallel seismic unit onlap over the mound system the central portion is characterized by the central carbonate mound system which is separate by a syn-hemigrabens and was tested by the 3-BRSA-1243-RJS and 3-BRSA-1172-RJS wells the southeast portion is characterized by a reactivated horst associated to tabular parallel seismic facies and tested by the 1-BRSA-1146-RJS well which confirmed the abundant presence of reworked carbonate facies et al 2021 Petersohn et al 2021 However these seismic facies occur below the oil-water contact and were not drilled by wells not allowing for their calibration The lower Barra Velha Formation predominantly presents vertical stacking of plane-parallel seismic facies with the prevalence of spheru lites and laminites The palaeodepth of the alkaline lake systems forming the BVE is still under debate Several authors Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Barnett 2017a Herlinger et al 2017 Ceraldi and Grenn 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Minzoni et al 2021 Wright 2022 agree that spherulites and laminites are deposited at greater water depths than shrub and reworked facies Therefore we interpret the aggradational stacking of relatively deeper lacustrine facies above the platforms as prevalent in the lower Barra Velha Formation Reactivation of the palaeohighs related to strong erosional behavior of IAU is observed mainly in eastern Berbiga o and Sururu areas Locally in the eastern Sururu horst we observed a strong pro gradational seismic pattern whereas in the south a backstepping seismic pattern prevailed Fig 7 This architecture can be a response to a differential subsidence rate related to the uplift of the reactivated fault system that affects the balance between the carbonate factory keep-up 15 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Table 2 Summary of geopressure and well log

the carbonate facies distribution and in putting distal facies in high relief locations During the deposition of upper BVE carbonate towers were depos ited due to the outbreak of geothermal fluids possibly enriched in Ca 2 and HCO3- in the surface along reactivated deep-seated faults The complex structural framework of the Iara Cluster influenced by a possible regional transfer zone probably focalized the occurrence of hydrothermal activity similar to other modern geothermal deposits Brogi et al 2014 DeMott et al 2021 The external geometrical result of those systems was diverse mound-type deposits SF-2 distributed along the NE-trending faults Fig 15 which are distinctly observed in the seismic section and constitute at least four main mound systems The wells that tested the carbonate reservoirs related to these mound fea tures found outstanding net pay and a high productivity index The central mound system in the Atapu area is dome-shaped with flat-lying basal concordance onlapping overburden relationship and chaotic internal geometry Fig 10 They are separated by a syn-tectonic parallel geometry with high amplitude The northeast mound Fig 10 system is characterized by a dome-shaped external geometry with a truncational basal relationship which could be a result of hydrothermal breccia deposits Planke et al 2005 and an onlapping overburden relationship as well as a downlapping internal geometry that indicates a possible NE progradation of the venting The high amplitude parallel seismic unit SF-1A onlaps this carbonate mound this contact can be a major reservoir property variation Travertine and carbonate breccia facies have been described in the 3-BRSA-1284-RJS lithology report associated with these seismic facies in the southeast area of Atapu The Sururu and Berbiga o twin mound systems occur in the western portion of the Iara Cluster separated from each other by an extensive graben Fig 9 The Sururu mound trend follows the S structural framework of the region culminating in a major mound feature in the Sepia Field that has been recently drilled and confirmed a discovery with an outstanding effective oil column Those mounds are character ized by a dome-shaped external geometry associated with flat-lying basal concordance onlapping overburden relationship and chaotic in ternal geometry Fig 9 In the Berbiga o area the basal concordance is characterized by an angular unconformity and the internal geometry locally exhibits aggradational internal convex-upward reflectors which is highlighted by the contrast with the surrounding high amplitude parallel seismic unit The southwestern mound trend of the Sururu Field was drilled by the well 3-BRSA-1212-RJS which in wellcore photog raphy exhibits steep shrubstone crust possibly deposited in epigean conditions by the thermal water flowing from the vent along the lateral slopes or in hypogean conditions related to the infilling of vertical to the tectonic uplift and the aggradation stacking that control the rift lake setting as presented by Fetter et al 2018 Although this architecture has already been described in other portions of the Santos pre-salt province Minzoni et al 2021 we cannot neglect the influence of seismic illumination and resolution in the interpretation of this feature Therefore we recommended that those patterns be confirmed in a higher-resolution seismic dataset Tectonic reactivation increases from the IAU to the Base of Salt resulting in a variety of seismic patterns throughout the Upper Barra Velha Formation Throughout the BVE deposition the Atapu area has the highest relative relief Fig 8 It was most likely experiencing tec tonic uplift as a result of the restraining bend caused by the accommo dation of tectonic blocks in the Iracema transfer zone Fig 4 In this context a considerable thinning of this unit has been identified Fig 8 indicating a possible imbalance between uplift and carbonate fabric maintenance resulting in evaporitic concentration of the palaeolake as well as sub-aerial exposition The predominant seismic pattern identi fied is a low amplitude discontinuous parallel seismic unit SF 1B which is interpreted as a shallow alkaline lake associated with strong reworking processes Fig 15 This interpretation is supported by the lithology descriptions of the wells 1-BRSA-1146-RJS and 3-BRSA-1284RJS which indicate the intercalation of shrubstones grainstones and rudstones as well as spherulitestones In contrast the other structures occupied relatively deeper alkaline lake settings compared with the Atapu area The Sururu area displays a predominance of an aggradational low amplitude parallel seismic pattern SF 1B associated with high internal reflector frequency on the top of the platform while the northwest portion exhibits a front-slope fill pattern SF-5 characterized by an onlap surface that culminates below the seismic resolution Fig 7 and in the southeast there is a highangle slope defining an asymmetrical platform The petrography report and wellcore sample photography of the wells 1-BRSA-618-RJS 3BRSA-1181D-RJS and 3-BRSA-891A-RJS that drilled the seismic pattern appointed indicate the predominance of mudstones and spherulites along the Upper Barra Velha Formation Therefore we interpreted that Sururu represents an aggradational stacking of relative distal alkaline lacustrine carbonate deposits related to a cyclical platform drowning through the NW low-angle slope in a proximal sublittoral environment The Berbiga o area represents an even further relative distal setting Fig 15 and it is characterized by a carbonate ramp platform restricted in the upper portions of a hemigrabens system surrounded by profundal deposits represented by the high-amplitude parallel seismic pattern SF1A Reactivation and fault reversal is distinctly observed in the area which is interpreted with a major control on the subsidence and 16 Marine and Petroleum

is larger than recent lake carbonate towers one of the largest described is placed on Pyramid Lake at nearly 100 m Benson 1994 The seismic morphology described for these features is totally anal ogous to the hydrothermal vents described by Planke et al 2005 Hansen 2006 Alvarenga et al 2016 the only missing feature is the intrusion event as a source system This can be the result of the low seismic resolution of the dataset used as indicated by Oliveira and Rancan 2018 or these vents are linked to the natural exhumation of mantle CO2 during the BVE deposition through the deep-fault systems Further reactivation of these systems after the salt deposition could trigger new upwellings of CO2-enriched fluids that were trapped and consequently contaminated the reservoir fluid as observed mainly in the Sururu and Atapu fields Based on those observations we interpreted that the mound units in Table 3 Summary of basic PVT and main reservoir fluid compositional properties Characteristics

condensate Pa o de A car discovery de Luca et al 2017 in the Campos Basin characterized by hydrothermally altered silicified carbonate on top of a paleovolcanic edifice onlapped by the deep lake profundal marls and shales beneath the salt unit brought attention to the role of stratigraphic-structural entrapment The identification of a stratigraphic closure related to lateral facies variation and pinch-out demands deeper seismic interpretation work flows In pre-salt studies this analysis is even more critical due to the low seismic resolution and the fact that the thinner the pay zone the harder it is to image the lateral trap Dolson et al 2018 which can be below the tuning thickness The seismic facies mapping integrated with multi-attribute analysis and conceptual geological modeling proved to be a strong tool for the qualitative estimation of reservoir boundaries during preliminary research Before the drilling of appraisal wells and 3D seismic survey acqui sition with higher resolution the Iara Cluster was interpreted as a nonsegmented megastructure defined by a vast four-way closure at the salt base GaffneyCline 2010 The continuity of the exploration campaign has shown not only the segmentation of the Iara Complex Petrobras 2013 but also an interesting hydraulic framework that highlights the existence of a stratigraphic-structural entrapment related to the lateral facies variation of a burial carbonate relief reservoir From the 11 exploration wells analyzed in this work which tested the reservoir in virgin condition 6 reached the water zone and several irregular OWCs were estimated with great vertical variation up to 200 m The projection of the maximum values of OWC for each structure reveals that only the Atapu area has the slight possibility of being defined as a four-way closure trap against the salt layers considering the velocity model uncertainty of 25 m obtained by the depth-seismic cali bration Even considering the maximum residual of 68 m the maximum the Sururu and Berbiga o areas are likely hydrothermal sublacustrine springs placed on a relatively distal alkaline lake settings The best morphological recent analog for those deposits is the Lake Abhe DeMott et al 2021 and Lake Bogoria Renaut et al 2013 located in the modern Kenya Rift Valley as well as the Pyramid Lake Benson 1994 and Searles Lake Guo and Chafetz 2012 located in the extensional basin lake of the USA The Atapu mounds are placed in shallower alkaline lake settings where the subaerial exposition played an important role It is identified as terrestrial travertine associated with mound-type and fissure ridge-type deposits in these settings Recent morphological ana logs for these deposits are the travertine described in Turkey and Italy De Filippis et al 2012 De Filippis et al 2013 Brogi et al 2014 Claes et al 2017 Mancini et al 2019 Brogi et al 2021 5 2 2 reservoir delimitation and pre-salt trapping model The investigation and definition of a trap have a major role in the prospect and play scales evaluation since it is an essential parameter for the economic assessment and consequently the target viability with the available technology and tools at that time Magoon and Dow 1994 Thus the early recognition of the entrapment style its complexities and modifications can help de-risk exploration and development campaigns Biddle and Wielchowsky 1994 The pre-salt play entrapment style has been defined as a structural trap characterized by a structural four-way closure of the Aptian car bonate reservoir against a thick salt layer Gomes et al 2012 Carlotto et al 2017 Abelha and Petersohn 2019 Zalan and Newman 2019 Some authors suggest and highlight the possibility of stratigraphic contribution to those traps in new exploration areas Buckley et al 2015 Kattah and Balabekov 2015 Kattah 2017 The gas and 18 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Fig 13 PVT and compositional properties Scatter plots

151 2023 106163 Fig 15 Conceptual geological model for the Iara Cluster highlighting the potential zones of lateral property variation surfaces and structural lows can be a powerful tool for estimating the stratigraphic boundaries of carbonate buried relief prospects When the initial accumulation area estimated by GaffneyCline 2010 is compared to the accumulation area obtained in this study considering the strati graphic boundary 310 22 km2 a reduction of 55 7 is observed Furthermore the Sururu and Berbiga o accumulations echo the discov ery of the Pa o de A car and encourage exploration to look beyond traps associated solely with four-way closures at the Base of Salt and inves tigate stratigraphic and combined traps in the deepest portions of the BVE and MCB settings structural closure of the Sururu area is 130m above the oil-water con tact In the Berbiga o area this relation is even more prominent almost 200m Therefore the stratigraphic framework plays a major role in the lateral stratigraphic entrapment of both areas As a result the reservoir s delimitation becomes a challenge which has a direct impact on the reserve estimation On the other hand the conceptual model built from mapping the spatial distribution of the seismic units can qualitatively indicate possible contacts between large-scale domains with the pre dominance of the reservoir and non-reservoir facies It is important to note that future quantitative interpretation analysis based on seismic inversion which increases seismic resolution and can be associated with rock properties could be decisive in consolidating or improving this model In the northern portion of the Sururu Field a high-amplitude parallel seismic unit SF-1A of the Upper BVE onlap the low-amplitude unit SF 1B creating a wedge-shaped feature This feature is interpreted as the onlap of deep facies over the tight alkaline sublittoral carbonates of the Sururu area similar to what occurs at the Pa o de A car discovery de Luca et al 2017 The occurrence of high amplitude parallel seismic units dominates structural lows which are characterized by local depocenters associated with graben and hemigrabens features although these features were not drilled in the area by public-domain wells The well 1-BRSA-886-RJS drilled the flank of a regional depocenter in the Santos Basin and was located 63 m from the Iara Cluster revealing a predominance of shales along the BVE formation de Freitas et al 2022 in this setting In the Berbiga o the contrast between high-amplitude parallel seismic units SF-1A and mounded patterns SF-2 or low-amplitude parallel seismic units SF 1B is even more pronounced indicating that the lateral variation of the carbonate facies is possibly even more abrupt significant and indicates a greater presence of non-reservoir facies along the platform areas stratigraphic stacking As a result of these findings we conclude that seismic pattern con trasts can be used to detect large-scale lateral variation in carbonate facies depending on the scale of investigation In particular identifying high-amplitude plane-parallel seismic units associated with onlap 5 3 Reservoir compartmentalization of Iara Cluster Different causes and processes can trigger the phenomenon of reservoir compartmentalization Jolley et al 2010 The primary causes are structural and depositional flow barrier formations although facies variations diagenesis geochemical variation and non-turbiditic events in siliciclastic systems can also result in reservoir zone dysconnectivity Chen 2013 However identifying and characterizing this phenome non is not an easy task considering that the analysis of any individual dataset can t reliably predict the compartmentalization of the reservoir Milkov et al 2007 This complicating factor stems from the inherent ambiguity in each type of pre-production data s individual interpreta tion For example not all faults identified in seismic data are potentially sealants requiring the analysis of cross-fault flow from the juxtaposition between reservoir and non-reservoir rocks along the fault Jolley et al 2010 Similarly the presence of low permeability rocks in the field can act as vertical flow barriers only if they are laterally extensive and correlatable Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 Reservoir pressure can equilibrate over time through a common aquifer Westrich et al 1999 Milkov et al 2007 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 or a dynamic seal Jolley et al 2010 Different oil-water contacts can be the result of a hydrodynamic aquifer Muggeridge and Mamode 2012 or the perched-water phenomenon instead of compartmentalization Gaafar et al 2016 Rolfsv g and Denielsen 2016 Macaluso et al 2019 20 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Dissimilarities in fluid properties can arise from petroleum charge his tories Peters and Fowler 2002 Milkov et al 2007 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 or post-accumulation processes such as thermal degradation Peters and Fowler 2002 Isaksen 2004 biodegradation Peters and Fowler 2002 Milkov et al 2007 Smalley and Muggeridge 2010 and gravitational segregation Peters and Fowler 2002 Milkov et al 2007 Pomerantz et al 2010 Therefore the best approach to reducing uncertainty when addressing the reservoir connectivity issue is through data integration which can be interpreted in terms of risk as proposed by Milkov et al 2007 The reservoir compartmentalization matrix generated for the Iara Cluster is shown in Table 4 The complex tectonostratigraphic history in the Iara Cluster is characterized by indications of hydrothermal vents in the formation of the reservoirs tectono-structural influence on the deposition of car bonates lateral facies variation associated with the transition from a shallow alkaline lake setting to a distal lacustrine environment and posterior reactivation of the structural framework Fig 14 This complexity contributes to the heterogeneity and abrupt contrast of permo-porous properties in the reservoir The scenario is prone to the formation of regional and local static or dynamic seals that affect hy draulic communication between reservoirs The high heterogeneity of these reservoirs also reflects the sharp contrast of the productivity index in the wells within the Berbiga o Sururu and Atapu structures with an emphasis on the occurrence of the highest indexes when associated with mound features or areas with reworked evidence The main potential permeability barriers identified in the Iara Cluster were faults and fractures with a high density of occurrence primarily in the Sururu and Atapu areas the Jiquia shale a significant vertical permeability barrier identified in almost all wells and clearly identified in gamma-ray and NMR porosity logs lateral facies variations in the upper Barra Velha system estimated by the abrupt contrast be tween the high amplitude plane-parallel seismic facies SF-1A and the others particularly the carbonate mound unit the occurrence of filling seismic features SF-5 and in the hanging wall of syn-depositional reactivated faults Therefore the occurrence of those features in the seismic data between the wells analyzed increases the risk of reservoir compartmentalization Table 4 The analysis of pre-production reservoir pressure indicates hydraulic communication of the oil zone between the Atapu and Sururu reservoirs whose gradients are compatible with each other respectively 0 0777 and 0 0785 kgf cm2 Fig 11 Berbiga o area presents two different oil gradients 0 0809 and 0 0989 kgf cm2 Fig 11 The first is slightly similar to those identified in the Sururu and Atapu accumulations while the second is observed in a more distal-setting structure distinctly hy draulically segmented from the others The density estimated from the oil gradient of the 3-BRSA-1032-RJS well presents values above the expected this result may be influenced by overpressured sampling points We observed irregular oil-water contacts and free water levels along and between the reservoirs some of which are associated with the same oil zone In static pressure by depth graphs Fig 16 the water gradient line occurs parallel with a vertical shift related to the same oil zone This pattern not only occurs in the Iara Complex but also in the Mero Petersohn et al 2021 and Tupi fields Mello et al 2021b This arrangement can indicate the phenomenon of the perched-water effect in the studied reservoirs It is defined as movable water above the transition zone that is not directly connected to the actual free-water table of a given hydrocarbon column due to the local entrapment of connate water that forces the water to move vertically through the layer Gaafar et al 2016 Rolfsv g and Denielsen 2016 Macaluso et al 2019 Therefore this effect is prone to occur when associated with rugged relief of the reservoir base Rolfsv g and Denielsen 2016 characteristic of buried-relief reservoirs and in carbonate mounds due to the influence of tight impermeable carbonate zones resulting from the depositional environment and diagenesis processes Gaafar et al 2016 Both situations are distinctly observed in the Iara Cluster Fig 16 not only in the hydrothermal mound alignments but also in the platform settings which can entrap the water during the drainage pro cess causing the occurrence of the perched-water contacts However the high density of faults observed in Atapu Fig 16 together with the presence of the Jiquia shale vertically separating the reservoirs of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations makes this phenomenon more susceptible in the area Furthermore the distal context observed in Berbiga o Fig 16 with strong permo-porosity contrasts along the BVE Table 4 Risk Matrix for the occurrence of compartmentalization inspired by Milkov et al 2007 Note that the level of dissimilarity between wells is directly proportional to the risk of reservoir segmentation 21 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Fig 16 Conceptual geological model of the reservoir compartments of the Iara Complex A Map of the base of salt containing the stratigraphic-structural boundaries of the reservoir as well as the possible permeability barriers B Segmentation style observed in the study area Atapu Style hydraulic communication throughout all the oil zone with vertical oil composition pool segmentation in the 3-BRSA-1172-RJS due to the Jiquia shale permeability barrier the perched-water effect is observed forming shifted parallel water gradients Berbiga o Style hydraulic compartmentalization between oil zones due to stratigraphic lateral variations resulting in different oil gradients reservoir also results in a considerable risk of this phenomenon occurring The oil component analysis mainly related to the gas associated with the single liquid hydrocarbon phase of those subsaturated reservoirs indicates important differences between the studied areas Figs 13 and 14 The reservoir connectivity risk factor is directly proportional to the degree of similarity between the compositions of the fluids sampled in different wells Table 4 The API degree of the oils sampled has similar values in the three areas with the exception of punctual samples from the Berbiga o and Sururu fields Fig 12 The Sururu area shows an increase in API degree values by depth indicating the presence of a compositional gradient of the oil column by gravitational separation Locally the same phenom enon possibly occurs in well 4-BRSA-1226-RJS in the southern portion of Berbiga o Because sample dissimilarity is related to the same composi tional gradient the post-accumulation process of gravitational separa tion makes direct comparison of fluid samples difficult regarding compartmentalization identification The Atapu accumulation presents the highest saturation pressure values of the reservoir whereas Sururu presents intermediate values and Berbiga o presents the lowest values The saturation pressure is directly proportional to the solubility ratio thus resulting in a similar distribution of these properties There is a correlation between the values of the solubility ratio and the content of CO2 and C1 diluted in the reservoir Therefore the Berbiga o contrasts with the other reservoirs presenting much lower levels of CO2 contamination in relation to the Sururu and Atapu accumulations Internally in Berbiga o slight differences are observed between the oil obtained from well 3-BRSA-1032-RJS which was drilled into a structure in a more distal context and the oil obtained from the main structure The oil in the main structure presents higher values of the properties studied while its southern portion presents a possible compositional gradient In Atapu an oil sample extracted from the Ita pema Formation reservoir is distinctly different from the others The well log analysis shows the presence of a vertical permeability barrier above this reservoir characterized by the radioactive shale Jiquia which may be segmenting the different oil pools The differences in oil composition observed in the Iara Complex reservoirs are interpreted as a result of different petroleum charge his tories and post-accumulation processes De Freitas et al 2022 when analyzing organic geochemical data from ten crude oil samples from the Santos Basin observed through the analysis of conventional biomarker source-related parameters that the oil sampled from well 3-BRSA-1172-RJS Atapu location is quite similar to the 1-BRSA-618-RJS Sururu location oil sample This oil family indicates lacustrine freshwater to sub-normal salinity conditions for the source rock de Farias et al 2021 which is interpreted as belonging to the Itapema formation mainly Rocha et al 2019 slight differences can be the result of distinct facies of the same formation due to salinity con dition variations Leite et al 2020 de Freitas et al 2022 The analysis of gas geochemistry proved to be a powerful tool for understanding the generation process thermal maturity and secondary alteration processes which provides inputs to reconstruct the reservoir accumulation history Lorant et al 1998 Prinzhofer et al 2000 Katz 2002 Santos Neto 2004 Milkov and Etiope 2018 Peng et al 2019 Souza et al 2022 The use of simple ratios of the molecular composi tion of gas C1 C2 C2 C3 C2 iC4 iC4 nC4 integrated with isotopic ra tios 13C and 2H can be used as a proxy for maturity estimation Lorant et al 1998 Katz 2002 Prinzhofer et al 2000 Peng et al 2019 Souza et al 2021 The molecular and stable isotopic composition of the associated hydrocarbon analyzed in this study suggests a thermogenic origin The methane origin diagrams based on 13C C1 versus 2H C1 and C1 C2 C3 of Milkov and Etiope 2018 support the interpretation of oil-associated thermogenic gas related to the transition from an early to late maturation stage Fig 17 A and B The range of those properties analyzed in this study is consistent with the samples analyzed by Souza et al 2021 The Iara Complex samples show a clear trend of increasing maturity with the Berbiga o reservoir samples more closely related to the early mature thermogenic gas stage and the Sururu and Atapu samples more closely related to the late mature thermogenic gas stage The same trend is observed in the scatter plot of C2 C3 versus C2 iC4 Fig 17C for the Iara Complex samples based on Peng et al 2019 This suggests that the oil kitchen that fed the Berbiga o reservoirs had less thermal maturity than the Sururu and Atapu kitchen The permeability barrier characterized by an extensive NE SW graben located in the east of Berbiga o presents very high efficiency preventing the homogeniza tion and mixing of fluids between the reservoirs over geological time Sururu and Atapu reservoirs may have shared the same oil kitchen Understanding the timing of the reservoir s CO2 contamination is

integration of the mo lecular and isotopic compositions of CO2 and noble gasses However other possibilities such as contact metamorphism in carbonate rock due to igneous intrusion are still in debate and require further investigation de Freitas et al 2021 Souza et al 2022 The spatial distribution of CO2 contamination contents indicates that the deep-seated fault setting associated with crustal hyperextended domains in the outer portions of the Santos Basin are the main pathways for the ascension of mantle-derived material and consequently for the migration of CO2 Gamboa et al 2019 Ferraz et al 2019 de Freitas et al 2022 the presence of spatial outliers of CO2 contamination in regions with a known expressive igneous occurrence supports other possible abiotic mechanisms of this component s generation de Freitas et al 2022 Considering that some depositional models for the Barra Velha for mation rely on CO2 degassing in the palaeolake and the chemical reactions that result Wright 2022 it appears that fluids enriched in this compound have been present in the system since the reservoir s formation Structural reactivation and igneous events in the basin can act as triggers for new pulses of CO2-enriched fluid generation and up welling migration New pulses of CO2 input in previously filled traps can cause partial or even total oil displacement Huang et al 2015 de Freitas et al 2022 The further deep CO2-rich fluids input can also change the geochemical characteristics of the crude oil present in the reservoir due to the heat and also the extraction of small saturated hydrocarbons which can be carried over long distances Liu et al 2017 The southern Berbiga o samples analyzed in this study show a clear decrease in C1 and C2 content with increasing CO2 content while C3 C5 content increases with CO2 contamination Fig 18 This pattern results in a decrease in dryness when there is such contamination The Sururu samples exhibit a clear decrease in C1 C5 content with increasing CO2 resulting in a relative increase in dryness because the decay of C2 C5 is greater than that of C1 Fig 18 The decrease in such components as a 23 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Fig 18 Relationship between CO2 and gas component content The first scatter plot represents the dryness while the others depict the relationships between the individual gas components and the CO2 contamination content result of contamination is indicative of the phenomenon of hydrocarbon light fraction displacement caused by CO2 flooding of these reservoirs The CO2 content of the Berbiga o reservoirs is strikingly lower than that of the Sururu and Atapu reservoirs Fig 13B Fig 17D This sug gests that these structures do not share the same migration pathways of fluids enriched in this component The Berbiga o reservoirs are located in a NE-SW structural trend hemigrabens system in the center of a crustal resistate domain Zalan and Newman 2019 de Freitas et al 2022 This scenario is unlikely for the ascent of mantle-derived fluids due to the large crustal thickness The Gato do Mato accumulation shares the same structural settings as Berbiga o and also does not present high levels of CO2 de Freitas et al 2022 Conversely the Sururu and Atapu reser voirs have a higher density of faults and are located in the rotated continuation of the structural trends of Se pia and Jupiter respectively which are situated in the transition from a crustal resistate domain to a thin crust Zalan and Newman 2019 de Freitas et al 2022 This external context is more favorable for the contribution of mantle-derived fluids and consequently CO2 contamination The cor relation between the increase in dryness and the CO2 content in the Sururu and Atapu samples Fig 17D could be an indication of the small saturated hydrocarbon displacement caused by the carbon dioxide migration into these structures Furthermore the lack of homogeniza tion of CO2 content along the Iara Complex reservoirs indicates the ef ficiency of reservoir compartmentalization via the permeability barriers observed mainly between Berbiga o and other oilfields Fig 16 Therefore when considering the observations discussed in sum mary we observed that there are at least four possible reservoir seg ments in the study area two in Berbiga o one in Sururu and the other in 24 J C S Vital et al Marine and Petroleum Geology 151 2023 106163 Atapu The similarity between the pressure gradients of the oil zone between the three main structures may be indicative of the presence of dynamic seals between the structures that allowed their homogenization over geological time The barrier between Atapu and Sururu appears to have been less effective allowing a more similar signature of oil composition or both structures were filled by fluid of similar composi tion which underwent gravitational separation in the Sururu area Regarding the evolution of the exploratory campaign in the region the Berbiga o and Sururu areas present the greatest risk of compart mentalization of the reservoir mainly due to the geological context of these areas which are more susceptible to the presence of stratigraphicstructural permeability barriers and baffles Meanwhile the perchedwater phenomenon is susceptible in all areas studied but presents the greatest risk in Atapu due to the abundant presence of faults in the lo cality associated with the existence of Jiquia shale vertical permeability barriers between Berbiga o B and the others Reservoir pressure equilibration through a dynamic seal or by a regional aquifer can explain the proximity of the gradients from Sururu and Atapu The PVT prop erties and composition of oil samples indicate important and pro found differences between the three oilfields and evidence of oil compositional gradient in Sururu and potentially in South Berbiga o A 4-BRSA-1226-RJS The basic gas geochemistry analysis indicates the oil-associated thermogenic origin of the associated gas from those undersaturated reservoirs A trend of maturity increasing is well defined in the sample studied indicating that the source kitchen that fed Berbiga o was in earlier stages of maturation than Sururu and Atapu In addi tion different CO2 contamination content is observed between those areas indicating the contribution of different migration pathways for the ascension of CO2-enriched fluids or different sources The decrease in the content of light oil fractions with increasing CO2 content in the Sururu and Berbiga o samples is indicative of oil displacement due to CO2 flooding 6 Conclusion Therefore our study highlights the importance of conducting a thorough integrated analysis to gain a better understanding of pre-salt reservoir connectivity and other effects of heterogeneities such as the perched-water phenomenon This analysis can contribute to predicting the reservoir behavior of other appraisal assets preventing reserve misestimation and possible unforeseen events during the production phase Furthermore our findings illustrate the effects of lateral reservoir quality obliteration on trap delimitation and how to infer them using seismic facies identification which can help with reservoir and trap derisking in new prospect evaluations This study presents a multi-proxy analysis to raise and address the impacts of vertical and lateral heterogeneities in pre-salt carbonate reservoirs in particular the evaluation of reservoir compartmentaliza tion and the perched-water effect The conclusions drawn from this analysis are A complex tectonostratigraphic history is observed in the study area with indications of syn-tectonic influence during the deposition of lower and upper Barra Velha formation and the role of hydrothermal vents in the reservoir formation from the Intra-Alagoas unconfor mity This history contributed to the formation of heterogeneity in the reservoir and abrupt contrasts in permeability through not only a high density of faults but also carbonate facies variation The seismic facies mapping integrated with structural interpretation seismic attribute analysis and consecutively conceptual geological modeling proved to be a strong tool for qualitative inference of reservoir boundaries The high amplitude parallel seismic facies SF1 are interpreted as a response to the predominance of relatively deeper lacustrine carbonate settings deposits with lower reservoir quality this unit usually transitions to low amplitude parallel seismic facies SF 1B and mounded seismic facies SF-2 through an onlap surface that forms a slope front fill seismic pattern SF-5 or abruptly by faults Therefore the occurrence of SF-5 is a strategic pattern to estimate and calibrate the stratigraphic reservoir boundary Irregular oil-water contacts were identified throughout the oilfields studied between them and internally the variation reaches 149 m between Atapu and Sururu Internal variations mainly in Atapu and Berbiga o A are interpreted as the result of the perched-water effect while external variations with high values are interpreted as a possible effect of reservoir compartmentalization The Iara oilfields are defined by stratigraphic-structural trapping related to the combination of the lateral variation of burial carbonate relief reservoir facies with the complex fault framework The best trap analog for those fields is the carbonate mound-related Pa o de A car pre-salt reservoir in the Campos basin The stratigraphic component limits the area of the Sururu and Berbiga o reservoirs mostly but guarantees a significant increase in structural relief and consequently gross pay In addition the Jiquia shale is an important vertical permeability barrier between the BVE carbonates and the ITP coquinas which compartmentalizes oil pools in central Atapu 3BRSA-1172-RJS The degree of dissimilarity between reservoir pressure the PVT properties and the composition of the oils sampled in the wells is directly proportional to the risk of reservoir compartmentalization The analysis of virgin reservoir static pressure pointed out similar ities between the oil gradient from Atapu and Sururu a slight dif ference between Berbiga o A and the rest and an abrupt difference Funding sources This research did not receive any specific grant from funding

place volume they can act as ow barriers or even high permeability layers if fracturing is high enough and contribute to the regional aquifer and pressure maintenance reservoir models Because of the FU incorporation dif culties and lack of correlation with lithological facies most 3D static models built from FU are merely a geostatistical procedure away from the well control without any lateral constraint of the facies interpolation Li et al 2017 Zhang et al 2018 However recent studies have incorporated seismic data into the FU modelling work ow for the FU interpolation Iravani et al 2018 considered the acoustic impedance as constraint for interpolation of petrophysical properties in a FU template Yarmohammadi et al 2014 Rastegarnia et al 2016 and Hatampour et al 2018 applied arti cial intelligence to obtain linear relationships between FU and seismic attributes creating their constraints to the FU facies modelling Penna and Lupinacci 2021 used a cumulative S-curve analysis to create a decametric FU rock typing and through a Bayesian probabilistic model performed 3D porosity and permeability adequate to the seismic acoustic impedance resolution All these seismic-generated FU models can later be successfully incorporated in the static modelling work ow of the reservoir as hard constraints or secondary variable in co-kriging techniques The usage of seismic attributes provides lateral control for FU interpolation away from the well and is especially relevant in large reservoirs with a reduced number of drilled wells However the vertical resolution of deterministic seismic inversion products is limited to the decametric scale above 20 m for Brazilian presalt reservoirs more details in Penna and Lupinacci 2021 In seismicincorporated FUs and uids movements detection the scale of observation is crucial as for instance porous fractured media will be more or less connected depending on the grid size Haridy et al 2020 Conventional methods of seismic facies classi cation do not extrapolate the vertical resolution further from the input data limit Considering that most of the FU classi cations are made in the core scale millimetric and transposed to well log scale centimetric then several upscale and downscale assumptions are needed to incorporate the decametric seismic results Penna and Lupinacci 2021 This paper proposes an approach to estimate seismic derived petrophysical property volumes at the metric scale Using data percentiles and a cumulative S-curve from the core porosity and absolute permeability we calculated a signi cant number of decametric and metric ow units that correlates with seismic acoustic impedance and responds for both large and small scales ow characteristics of the reservoir Within each iteration of decametric and metric ow units from the geostatistical seismic inversion we co-simulated petrophysical properties volumes that respect the well information in the metric scale and are laterally consistent with the local geology regardless of the input resolution limit 2 Study area and geological settings Mero reservoir part of the Libra block is located in the northeast portion of the Santos Basil Brazil Fig 1

FWI velocity model high and low-salt velocity layers like anhydrite tachyhydrite carnallite and sylvinite as well as igneous rocks 1701 R Penna and W M Lupinacci Petroleum Science 21 2024 1699e1718

This procedure is presented and discussed and by Seifert et al 2017 In the presalt interval the seismic data has approximately 15 Hz of peak frequency with bandwidth of 5e35 Hz Based on the local geology petrophysical characteristics and the seismic spectral distribution Penna and Lupinacci 2021 created a wedge model to estimate the vertical resolution of the full-stack seismic considering the true thickness resolving capacity According to their analyses the vertical resolution is 62 m when considering the seismic amplitude and 23 m from inverted acoustic impedance volume Thus any layer below these limits will be falsely estimated in terms of thickness This means that facies or ow unit mapped from seismic amplitude or inverted acoustic impedance volumes will present decametric proportions 4 Metric ow units facies discretization and rock typing statistics Fig 3 Barra Velha and Itapema formations SMLP Black lines represent decametric scale ow units and green lines represent metric scale ow units In this chart storage capacity is the product of core porosity versus layer thickness and ow capacity is the product of core permeability versus layer thickness We considered this only as a qualitative plot and a great visual tool for evidencing the scale-dependence of the petrophysical properties Considering the amount of conventional core analysis available in the Mero reservoir we used two methods based on permeability k versus porosity f for ow unit discretization First we considered Gunter et al 1997 stratigraphic modi ed Lorenz plot SMLP as a visual aid to estimate a minimum number of ow units and identify local reservoir ow trends in both decametric and metric scales Then we calculated rock quality index ow zone indicator RQI FZI for the discretization Amaefule et al 1993 Those are both extensively documented methods successfully applied in both clastic and carbonate geological settings The SMLP was rst introduced by Gunter et al 1997 by plotting the percent storage capacity product of porosity and thickness versus percent ow capacity product of permeability and thickness providing a visual guide to estimate how many FUs are necessary to honor the geologic framework in terms of uid movement in the subsurface Fig 3 shows the SMLP plot of both Barra Velha and Itapema formations using percentiles of all the samples for a cleaner display of the chart The minimum number of the FU estimate is performed by observing the slope and behavior of the curve as the mean storage and ow capacity increases we have better ow units in terms of its permoporous characteristics In that sense at segments can correspond to seals baf e zones or low-production zones as they may present some level of porosity but have limited contribution of permeability Steep segments correspond to speed zones of the reservoir and they can have low or high porosity but provide major contributions to the reservoir ow performance We estimated the minimum number of ow units in the SMLP using a sequence stratigraphy reasoning for high order and low order variations like a Wheeler Diagram interpretation Wheeler 1958 The plot in Fig 3 clearly demonstrates how the ow unit characterization is scale dependent Variations of the low- and high-frequency cycles are correlational since the slope of the low frequency curve depends on the constructive effect of each high frequency curve Penna and Lupinacci 2021 introduced a work ow for the detection of decametric ow units using inverted acoustic and shear impedance volumes considering the black lines 1702 R Penna and W M Lupinacci Petroleum Science 21 2024 1699e1718 1 Take all the core porosity and permeability measurements and calculate statistical relevant percentiles the number varies depending on the data characteristics Each percentile is a representative sample from a given interval 2 Calculate RQI and FZI values using Eqs 1 and 2 and the percentiles values 3 Order the data with increasing values of log FZI 4 Accumulate and normalize the percentiles of permeability values 5 Calculate the slope of the curve for each sample Fig 4 as decametric trend Fig 3 However our purpose here is to characterize higher orders of uid movements in the reservoir as metric ow units using the acoustic impedance as constraints obtained from a geostatistical seismic inversion For this eight FU are considered as metric ow trends green lines in Fig 3 SMLP are used in this work only as a visual guide for this scale-dependence of the petrophysical properties The ow unit discretization is performed in the core analysis using the rock quality index ow zone indicator RQI FZI and then transposed to the well log data This method is based on permeability in mD and effective porosity fE ratio and derived from a generalization of the Kozeny-Carmen equations Kozeny 1927 It was introduced by Amaefule et al 1993 and is widely used due to its simplicity and assertive results Let the index RQI reservoir quality index in mm be s k RQI 0 0314 fE As described in the SMLP at least two scales of variations are observable in the derivative data Fig 3 one on a small scale higher order related to metric variations and other on a large scale lower order related to decametre variations Penna and Lupinacci 2021 chosen to interpretate the major jumps in the slope curve as the decametric ow characteristics changes in the reservoir although this can be extended to many scales The lower scale of observation responds to low frequency variations in the SMLP and FZI S-curve plots and higher order of variations responds to high frequency variations This was t for purpose as the scope of their work were to characterize ow units in the decametric scale and then correlate with elastic attributes Given that the aim 1 where k is the absolute permeability in mD and fE the effective porosity Then the FZI is given by FZI RQI fZ 2 where fZ is an effective porosity normalization on the form fZ fE 1 fE Since its derivation from Kozeny-Carmen equations FZI value is approximates an average pore throat radius for a given porous media relating effective porosity and permeability Different sedimentation environments late diagenetic processes and reservoir geometry are also controlling parameters of FZI Tiab and Donaldson 2004 Taking log on both sides of Eq 2 and rearranging it we verify the linearity between FZI RQI and fZ logRQI logFZI log fZ 3 In log-log plot of the RQI versus fZ a constant value of the FZI produces an inclined straight line The inference is that samples with similar ow behavior falls around a corresponding slope line determining a single ow unit FU Samples with distinct ow characteristics are plotted in different parallel lines and arrange distinct ow units Different methodologies for clustering samples around FZI values and creating FU are available in the literature and applied in different geological scenarios In some cases a simple log FZI histogram discretization is enough to discretize the ow units considering that the samples show strong FZI versus permeability correlation and a log-normal FZI distribution More complex methods such as iterative multi-linear regressions Al-Ajmi and Holditch 2000 and normal probability plots cumulative distribution function Mahjour et al 2016 are also widely used especially in more complex geological settings Penna and Lupinacci 2020 2021 showed that the usage of percentiles and a cumulative S-curve produced a signi cant minimum amount of ow units with statistical relevance without compromising the estimation of petrophysical properties This is particularly relevant to the scope of this study considering the amount of k and f measurements the high complexity degree of the Mero reservoir and the aim to correlate the FU to seismic data with respect to its vertical resolution limit The steps to construct the RQI FZI cumulative S-curve as presented by Penna and Lupinacci 2021 are Fig 4 The log FZI S-curve for MFU discretization Grey line corresponds to decametric FU classi cation after Penna and Lupinacci 2021 and red line corresponds to metric FU classi cation 1703 R Penna and W M Lupinacci Petroleum Science 21 2024 1699e1718 of the present study is to get a step further discretizing metric ow units with the seismic data we interpret the major jumps in the slope plot rst order variation that corresponds to the decametric FU same as Penna and Lupinacci 2021 and the second order variation as the metric FU Using both effective porosity and permeability from the nuclear magnetic resonance NMR well logs the RQI FZI values are calculated for each well through Eqs 1 and 2 The discretization of the FU in the metric MFU and decametric DFU scales from the FZI S-curve plot is shown in Fig 4 Eight metric ow units are interpreted considering the changes in the FZI S-curve slope Note that the number of metric ow units correlates to the SMLP interpretation as a higher order variation from the decametric scale The cut-offs in log FZI used for discretizing the ow metric units MFU are shown in Table 1 The initial at segment parallel to the X axis of the FZI S-curve Fig 4 describes FUs that have no contributions to the ow behavior in the metric scale Therefore MFU1 and MFU2 are considered seals or baf e zones that retain uid ow acting as vertical and horizontal barriers In general rocks with reduced matrix porosity like igneous rocks cemented and clayey carbonates are into these units MFU3 is denoted by the initial detachment of the curve from the X axis and subsequently MFU4 Fig 4 These FUs have some ow capacity but are very poor in terms of overall reservoir ow behavior This is the typical behavior of carbonates with some late diagenetic effects like quartz and dolomite cementation obliterating the original matrix porosity of the rock Although not directly considered for production they are important for maintaining reservoir pressurization over production time MFU5 and MFU6 are the rst ramp up of the curve Fig 4 with better permoporous reservoir characteristics then the previous units Although some level of diagenetic effect can occur they will have considerable contributions to reservoir ow during production Some bioclastic grainstones packstones and wackestones belongs to MFU5 and MFU6 for example The end of the curve corresponds to the better FUs in terms of permoporous characteristics MFU7 and MFU8 They have considerable porosity and remarkable ow performance during production In general MFU7 and MFU8 correspond to clean calcite carbonates like bivalve rudstones coquinas from the Itapema Formation and shrubs and rework facies from the Barra Velha Formation with little or none late diagenetic effects Penna and Lupinacci 2021 Fig 5 demonstrates how the new classi cation differs from the decametric ow unit DFU considering the seismic vertical resolution limitation The relationship between DFU1 and MFU1 and MFU2 for instance are quite notable as the latter are a one-step upscaling of the rst one The mean median and standard deviation of the acoustic impedance PI effective porosity f and Schlumberger-Doll Research Al-Ajmi and Holditch 2000 permeability k for each metric ow units are displayed in Table 2 These calculations were performed using the well logs Note that the Fig 5 Application of log FZI cut-off discretization in Well 6 using the effective porosity from the magnetic resonance data Lithologies on the left correspond to a simpli ed classi cation for seismic facies analysis purposes after Penna et al 2019 overall values of the PI tend to decrease from MFU1 to MFU8 while porosity and permeability increase This is expected as MFU1 corresponds to low-FZI values small pore throat radius and MFU8 has high-FZI values large pore throat radius In general the distribution of PI porosity and permeability for MFU are close to symmetric with little mean versus median differences 5 Geostatistical seismic inversion for metric ow units Table 1 Metric FU MFU cut-offs from the FZI S-curve 5 1 Stochastic seismic inversion method log FZI values MFU1 MFU2 MFU3 MFU4 MFU5

select a random location in the volume the current state of the chain The lateral sampling is consistent with the seismic data grid and the vertical sampling is 1 m II Randomly generate a modi ed realization res1 A synthetic seismic synth1 is calculated through convolution between the estimated wavelet and res1 acoustic properties Considering the Bayesian inference scheme compute the likelihood function of res1 given the real seismic data P seis synth1 III Evaluate the prior distribution of the modi ed realization P res1 geostats which re ects the lateral and vertical continuity computed from the variograms and the value of the property at neighboring cells IV Multiply the prior distribution P res1 geostats with the likelihood function P seis synth1 to compute the posterior probability value given the input information e g statistics well data seismic horizons and stratigraphy This step is the Bayesian inference of the algorithm V Compare the posterior probability value with the current reservoir model res0 If the proposal res1 has a posterior probability value higher than res0 there is P res1 geostats seis P res0 geostats seis then res1 is accepted and the chain moves to a different random location considering res1 as the new current state Otherwise if the value is smaller res1 can be randomically rejected and res0 is the current stat for the next step or accepted as a ratio between P res1 geostats seis and P res0 geostats seis Note that this part is the Metropolis-Hastings of the algorithm avoiding the calculation to be stuck in local maxima minima as lower probabilities are sometimes accepted VI The process continues updating for the entire seismic volume until P resn geostats seis is no longer changing Due to the large number of calculations needed to sweep the entire volume the MCMC algorithm only calculate the conditional posterior pdf on a small portion of the volume at a time Combination them all gives the global posterior pdf between well data within a stratigraphic framework The most common method is the sequential gaussian simulation SGS Deutsch and Journel 1992 Since the introduction by Haas and Dubrule 1994 stochastic seismic inversion is an active topic of interest as the technique introduces seismic data as a constraint to generate possible earth models Doyen 2007 However the direct use of seismic as secondary data for reservoir modelling is usually frustrating because of vertical scale differences between seismic usually decametric resolution and well logs centimetric Finding a relationship between for instance seismic amplitude and or impedance volumes and well log porosity is constantly dif cult making the incorporation of seismic data directly into the SGS work ow a challenge for reservoir characterization Azevedo and Soares 2018 The most documented and used methods for stochastic seismic inversion are SGS Escobar et al 2006 direct sequential simulation DSS Soares 2001 global stochastic inversion GSI Soares et al 2007 and Monte Carlo Markov Chain MCMC Statmod MC Sams et al 2011 Although these methods differ in how to sample a prior posterior pdf they essentially produce multiple realizations of petrophysical properties considering the stratigraphic grid and a given vertical sampling that can be smaller than the available seismic sampling Every iteration produces a geologic model that ts the seismic and well log data i e each realization is plausible samples of the reservoir s posterior distribution and a variance measure of the input parameters considering the seismic data as constrains In this study we perform a Metropolis-Hastings MH algorithm within the MCMC method MCMC Statmod MC Sams et al 2011 to simulate the acoustic impedance There are three main steps in the stochastic inversion work ow which are detailed further 1 Statistical modelling where are estimated the probability density functions pdfs variograms and trends for each decametric and metric facies 2 Bayesian inference combining the Note that the MCMC algorithm does not change the whole res0 trace considering a single iteration Instead a small portion of the grid is modi ed a step at a time until the entire grid is swept All the pdfs are local so they are re-calculated every time it moves to another part of the volume For our purpose the stochastic seismic inversion ts very well

decametric ow units we used the mode considering each of the most likely facies volumes derived from the Bayesian classi cation Penna and Lupinacci 2021 Both lateral variograms were calculated along the main Mero structural direction NE-SW The same DFU lateral variograms were considered for the MFU Also no considerable difference was found between lateral variograms of the Barra Velha and Itapema formations therefore we used the same variograms for both formations In general they are a mixture between 90 Gaussian and 10 exponential curves with a range around 2500 m for the PI and 1000 m for DFU and MFU Fig 8 Acoustic impedance pdfs for DFU are the same as shown in Penna and Lupinacci 2021 For MFU we estimated normal PI pdfs for the Barra Velha and Itapema formations as shown in Fig 9 Due to the high resolution of the discretization it is expected that the PI seismic inversion is set to obtain the acoustic impedance and decametric and metric ow units de ned from the FZI cut-offs described in Table 1 We maintain the FZI S-curve relation between decametric and metric ow units that is MFU1 and MFU2 will only occur if DFU1 is present for instance This is compatible to the ow multi-scale of observation reasoning used for discretization We used experimental vertical variograms calculated from well logs for acoustic impedance decametric and metric ow units Fig 7 shows an example of the experimental and modelled variograms They are a mixture of 60 gaussian and 40 exponential with vertical range of 20 m for PI of 5e10 m for DFU and of 3e6 m for MFU No differences were observed between vertical variograms of the Barra Velha and Itapema formations so we considered the same variogram parametrization for both layers Experimental lateral variograms were calculated

for the cosimulation MFU1 and MFU2 are concentered along the zero-permeability axis Both Barra Velha and Itapema formations show the same behavior These sections are a good example of the advantage of using the seismic constraints over decametric scale and stochastic simulation over metric scale below seismic resolution To illustrate the special distribution PI mean and DFU and MFU mode maps from the Itapema Formation are displayed in Fig 12 Overall prior and posterior pdfs result for PI inversion are consistent within few errors along Barra Velha and Itapema formations except for MFU1 and MFU2 Fig 13 The reason for the discrepancy for these two ow units is the addition of an increasing a prior probability of DFU1 at lower structural regions areas without drilled wells mainly with predominance of mud sediments that corresponds to low PI values Because of those areas this pushes the posterior MFU1 and MFU2 PI values to the left of the plot For the other MFUs metrics such as mean standard deviation P10 and P90 are in match between prior and posterior pdfs The overall prior and posterior proportions of DFU and MFU for both Barra Velha and Itapema formations is presented in Fig 14 MCMC inversion produced occurrence volumes that corroborate the well statistics DFU except for the wells used as blind-tests are a perfect match between prior and posterior because they were used as hard constraints at the well location This is not the case for MFU whose small deviations are observed between prior and posterior proportions superimposition between MFU units is larger than the DFU pattern One of the aims is solve this ambiguity through MCMC simulations and several iterations producing a numerous amount of possible MFU occurrence volumes constrained to the seismic data in decametric scale The general behavior observed concentrates more MFU1 in higher PI values and MFU8 in lower PI values like the DFU behavior We chose not to use a constant value for the priori probability in the Bayesian classi cation as the facies are highly heterogenous in carbonate environments Instead we constructed volumes regarding the laterally variable priori probability for each DFU extrapolating through ordinary kriging the facies In the wells considering horizons and framework Since there are no wells drilled in structural lows therefore sampling low-energy settings in the study area we applied a multiplier to raise the prior occurrence probabilities of worse permoporous DFU and MFU away from the Mero main structural high This behavior is corroborated by numerous presalt analogs that drilled this speci c setting Lima and De Ros 2019 Neves et al 2019 Gomes et al 2020 For each DFU occurrence there is a prior probability of MFU that corresponds to a mean ratio between its correlated facies obtain from the well data For example if DFU1 occurs in a given location a prior probability for MFU1 is 60 and 40 for MFU2 Fig 10 exempli es how a prior probability varies laterally for DFU4 for exempli cation and a prior probability ratio from MFU1 to MFU8 considering the occurrence of each associated DFU 5 4 Porosity and permeability cosimulation We cosimulated for each PI iteration a numerous quantity of possible f and permeability k volumes given the MFU distributions calculated by the MCMC inversions The procedure for the cosimulation is similarto the work ow described in Section 5 1 with the difference that the posterior probability is now coupled with the simulated PI value there is we are sampling for P porosity geostat simPI and P permeability geostat simPI It is important to emphasize that the porosity and permeability cosimulation is restricted with the MFU below the seismic resolution However MFU is directly related to a speci c DFU that is constrained by seismic data So at the end the porosity and permeability are simulated on the metric scale without losing the seismic lateral control Through well data analysis and porosity and permeability volumes obtain from the Bayesian classi cation the vertical and lateral experimental variograms are like those used to the PI MCMC inversion Figs 7 and 8 The porosity and permeability pdfs used for the cosimulation are showed in Fig 15 As previously shown in Table 2 basic statistics MFU1 concentrate worse permoporous samples and MFU8 better We considered a cosimulation for each 5 3 Stochastic seismic inversion results and quality control QC We performed 100 iterations for the MCMC stochastic seismic inversion that is 100 possible solutions were calculated for the acoustic impedance DFU and MFU given the seismic data as constraint The mean wavelet necessary for the synthetic seismic convolution is the same used for the seismic inversion by Penna et al 2019 Initially all the wells with available well-log data were used as hard constrains for the inversion Then we removed three wells to blind-tests and performed the inversion The presented results in this publication are blind-test versions of the MCMC inversion The mean PI and DFU and MFU most probable occurrence from the 100 iterations and the results of two random iterations are presented in Fig 11 Clearly one notices the relation and distribution of low-PI values as DFU3 and DFU4 and MFU5 to MFU8 while high-PI values tend to concentrate more DFU1 and DFU2 and consequently MFU1 to MFU4 Also we noted how the occurrence of each MFU is conditioned to the occurrence of its correlated DFU 1712 R Penna and W M Lupinacci Petroleum Science 21 2024 1699e1718 Fig 16 a Most probable MFU and mean porosity and

Petroleum Science 21 2024 1699e1718 Fig 17 Prior and posterior pdfs and cumulative pdfs for the 100 cosimulations for porosity and permeability results corroborates the robustness and predictability of the method A slighter higher amount of errors for MFU then DFU in the blind wells are expected considering that the simulation constraint is stronger for decametric scale given the seismic vertical resolution characteristics Thus it s more reliable to analyze the posterior prior pdfs analysis once we are trying to mimic the probability distribution of the data Summarizing we produced a series of possible PI DFU MFU porosity and permeability volumes through an MCMC inversion and cosimulation which are laterally compatible with the seismic data and vertically with the well data statistics Fig 19 MCMC iteration that is 100 possible porosity and permeability solutions were calculated given the input variograms pdfs and PI volumes Mean and individual results are displayed in Fig 16 as well as the corresponding MFU from the related MCMC inversion In practice given these results we can stablish pessimistic optimistic and base scenarios for the Mero reservoir considering parameters such as net to gross porous volumes and volume in place We also performed the prior and posterior pdfs analysis for the permeability and porosity As previously shown in the PI QC Fig 13 the cosimulation produces results below the seismic resolution that are compatible with the well data statistics without relevant discrepancies and without losing the seismic constrain in the decametric scale The pdf comparison is presented in Fig 17 Also in Fig 18 inputs and mean outputs from porosity and permeability are displayed for two blind wells Overall the QC 6 Conclusions The proposed work ow provided means to generate numerous 1714 R Penna and W M Lupinacci Petroleum Science 21 2024 1699e1718 Fig 18 MFU porosity and permeability estimation QC for two blind wells in the area Black lines correspond to input data and red lines to output data accurate porosity and permeability relations and consequently a better volumetric distribution of these properties Due to vertical resolution limitations the distribution of MFU is not constrained by the seismic data being dependent exclusively on the simulation method used This can lead to some calculation errors that falls along any method of lateral extrapolation of discrete and continuous properties chosen However we tried to address this problem constraining the calculation of MFU with the occurrence of DFU In this decametric scale the seismic can constrain the results minimizing some of the large errors that could occur We strongly recommend that some uncertainty analysis be performed through the probabilistic outputs of the work ow We believe that interpretation of scenarios based on the volumes generated by the proposed methodology e g P10 P50 and P90 will positively impact the static and dynamic model building process as well as 4D seismic interpretation and seismic assisted history matching possible porosity and permeability 3D volumes below the seismic resolution limit respecting the seismic data in decametric scale Like many seismic Bayesian inference algorithms the prior information plays an important role in the posterior distribution of PI and consequently porosity and permeability We highly recommended that prior models are built representing local geology aspects or its analogs constraining some characteristics that sometimes are not sampled even in the presence of numerous wells That is the case of prior and posterior pdfs for MFU1 and MFU2 which the prior information volume forces the occurrence of worse permoporous facies clay-rich carbonates in structural lows causing a deviation of posterior pdf towards low-PI values These carbonates were not drilled by wells once they are below the O W contact However several analog data from other presalt reservoirs indicate the presence of such facies Even in the presence of high MFU superimposed zones in the acoustic domain our work ow achieved a satisfactory posterior blind-well proportion This issue can be addressed by generating a suf cient number of iterations and constraining MFU with its corresponding DFU guaranteeing the seismic correlation at larger scales As shown in previous studies DFU presents a reduced amount of elastic and acoustic superimposition and can be quanti ed in terms of deterministic inversion and Bayesian probabilistic classi cation However the presence of noise and imaging problems in the seismic can propagate errors in the decametric scale to metric scale causing porosity and permeability deviations Understanding ow behavior at decametric scale is the rst step to build the dynamic reservoir knowledge at smaller scales but detailed analysis can be performed with much more accuracy in the metric scale In complex reservoir settings where the uid ow is in ected by numerous processes it is important to have more ow units to correctly characterize the ow behavior producing more CRediT authorship contribution statement Rodrigo Penna Writing e review editing Writing e original draft Methodology Investigation

Seismic-stratigraphic framework The discovery of giant oil accumulations in the Pre-salt sag section of the Santos Basin has attracted huge interest in the lacustrine carbonate deposits of the Aptian Barra Velha Formation Although for the significant volume of publications on the Pre-salt section there is still limited understanding of its tectono-stratigraphic evolution and lack of a coherent published stratigraphic framework for the Tupi Field the largest and most productive Pre-salt accumulation This work aims to define a seismic-stratigraphic framework in the Aptian Presalt interval of the Tupi Field using 19 seismic lines and photomicrographs of thin sections from 13 wells Four seismic units SU1 SU2 SU3 and SU4 and two seismic facies SFA and SFB were identified The depositional pattern of the seismic units is of a continuous expansion of the accommodation space although with significant erosion at the top of SU4 SFA is composed mostly of calcite spherulites and Mg-clays mud which constitutes the background of lacustrine sedimentation preferentially formed and or preserved in relatively deeper areas SFB corresponds to crusts of fascicular calcite shrubs preferentially precipitated in relatively higher areas and to intraclastic deposits of reworked spherulites and shrubs The Pre-Alagoas unconformity represents the base of the study interval The top is characterized by a regional unconformity which represents a temporal gap between the youngest of the units SU4 and the start of the evaporitic deposits of the Ariri Formation No additional un conformities were identified within the Barra Velha Formation in the Tupi Field characterizing a continuously expansive deposition on a flat tabular and onlapping pattern upon the Outer High as a product of continuous accommodation creation under low tectonic activity The predominant post-depositional configuration together with the continuity and onlap patterns of seismic units onto a remanent high support a shallow evaporitic lake model rather than a deep lake with microbial platforms for the Tupi Field area 1 Introduction The main petroleum fields of Brazil produce from the Pre-salt section of the Santos Basin ANP 2021 The origin of these deposits is related to the Gondwana supercontinent breakup and the resulting opening of the South Atlantic Ocean during Early Cretaceous The Santos Basin extends through approximately 350 000 Km2 of the southeastern Brazilian coast with up to 10 Km infill in its depocenter Chang et al 2008 The study area is located in the Tupi Field of Santos Basin around 230 Km offshore from the Rio de Janeiro coast eastern Brazilian margin Fig 1 The interval of interest is between 4700 and 6000 m beneath sea level below more than 2000 m of water column and up to 2000 m of salt column ANP 2018 Tupi Field is not only the largest 1875 Km2 but also the main oil producer in Brazil with an average daily production of 948 076 bbl Assine et al 2008 The main objectives of this work are 1 to provide a seismicstratigraphic framework to the Aptian Barra Velha Formation BVF in the Tupi Field comprising seismic units and surfaces and their recog nition patterns and geological significance 2 to define seismic facies by combining seismic textures with petrographic characteristics in order to propose 3 a geological evolution model for the BVF in the area We hope that these results and interpretations may contribute to the exploration of other areas in the pre-salt province as well as to in crease the recovery efficiency from the producing fields

2000 Unternehr et al 2010 Lentini et al 2010 Saller et al 2016 The transition from a lacustrine to a marine environment corresponded to a change from the chemical deposits of magnesian clays and calcite of the BVF to the evaporites of the Late Aptian Ariri Formation Pereira and Feijo 1994 The evapo ration rate promoted the deposition of up to 3 0 km thick salt layers Chang et al 1990 Pereira and Macedo 1990 Thus the main Pre-salt reservoirs of the BVF are composed of carbonate rocks which seal cor responds mostly to halite and anhydrite of the Ariri Formation The Tupi Field was discovered in 2006 by a Petrobras consortium with Petrogal and Shell The study interval corresponds to the carbonate Middle to Late Aptian Barra Velha Formation Fig 2 This unit was deposited in a geological context of regional thermal subsidence char acteristic of the so-called sag section of the basin This condition developed after the mechanical subsidence of the rift section ceased as final crustal adjustments preceding the effective continental breakup took place Karner and Driscoll 1999 Karner and Gamboa 2007 The rift section is divided into two phases sin-rift I and II Chang et al 1992 Karner and Driscoll 1999 Syn-rift I phase represents the economic basement of the basin composed of volcanic rocks of the Hauterivian Cambori Formation Syn-rift II phase is characterized by a fluvial-lacustrine environment responsible for the deposition of organic matter-rich sediments from the Barremian Pi arras Formation main pre-salt source rocks and the bioclastic carbonates of the Early Aptian Itapema Formation Karner and Driscoll 1999 Chang et al 2008 The sag section Brumbaugh et al 1994 Henry et al 1995 Quirk et al 2013 also called the sin-rift III Chang et al 1992 or the transitional section Pereira and Feijo 1994 is characterized by a large and laterally continuous regional depression generated predominantly by thermal subsidence The evaporitic deposition of this phase was controlled by the presence of volcanic highs Sa o Paulo dorsal which restricted the circulation of seawater from the south and by a hot and dry climate Demercian 1996 This sag basin seems to have extended 3 Materials and methods This work was developed using 19 2D seismic lines of large regional size from the 0258 2D SPEC BM S survey These lines are final migrated zero-phase two-way travel time without depth conversion The seismic attributes used for seismic facies definition were the Rela tive Acoustic Impedance and Cosine of Phase A set of 13 exploratory wells all with checkshots was used to verify the lithologic correspon dence of the recognized seismic intervals Photomicrographs of repre sentative thin sections from sidewall samples were selected for the identification of the characteristic Pre-salt lithological types Conven tional well logs such as gamma-ray resistivity sonic dT and density present no significant differentiation within the interval and thus were not used to characterize the seismic facies All the data were made Fig 1 A Location map of the Santos basin B Location map of the study area with 2D seismic lines and wells studied Data from Geodata ANP 2021 All shown seismic panels are within the study area boundary 2 V P Sommer et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 118 2022 103947 Fig 2 Stratigraphic chart of the rift and

according to the aca demic data sharing to universities policy orders 10252 and 10253 The produced maps are on milliseconds TWT two-way travel time due to the original seismic source This includes structural maps on vertical TWT based - milliseconds and time-based thickness millisec onds also called isochores Although knowing the limitations of timebased thickness maps mainly related to the lack of real thickness determination and to the lateral variations in real thickness due to the heterogeneous velocity interval we still considered such maps useful to locate relative lows highs and to allow relative comparisons of regional thickness We considered this information relevant for areas with limited publication even with this limitation The first step in seismic stratigraphic interpretation involved the analysis of reflectors and their terminations classified in toplap downlap onlap and erosional truncation Fig 3B The analysis of those terminations allowed identifying the surfaces with the most significant chronological meaning which define the seismic stratigraphic units Mitchum Jr et al 1977 In addition the analysis of the geometric patterns as amplitude continuity and frequency configurations of the reflectors were used to determine the seismic facies This methodology was first established by Vail and Mitchum et al 1977 based on passive margins where the base level sea level is Fig 3 Summary chart for reflector termination analysis A The general interpretation of reflectors from seismic 0575 with zoomed-in sections 1 2 B Schematic interpretation of

118 2022 103947 controlled by the relationship between accommodation space tectonics and eustatic mechanisms of subsidence and uplift and sedimentary influx However the study interval was developed in a continental breakup system in which the base level is related to the lake level Vieira 1998 Further Nichols 2009 observed that level variations of intracratonic lakes without connection to the sea was controlled by climate changes what makes such level change cycles more frequent A systematic mapping of reflectors terminations was performed in four seismic lines through the entire sag interval In this particular section Fig 3A the reflectors have good traceability at all depth levels although lateral continuity decreases towards the southeast The am plitudes are variable and the biggest values are concentrated in the upper central region Although the filling concordant with the top and base surfaces indicates tabular deposition in the interval an apparently irregular pattern is related to the disturbance of the seismic response below the thick evaporitic package configuration of the sag phase This unconformity is well-known in the Brazilian margin basins and is called the Pre-Alagoas unconformity Karner 2000 Moreira et al 2007 and it defines the base of the BVF On the seismic lines this surface has a high positive amplitude and presents top erosional truncations of underlying reflections syn-rift at SE However the concordant reflections predominate Fig 3A The top surface is located between the BVF and the Ariri Formation This surface is easily identified because it is marked by a highly positive amplitude reflector originated from the acoustic impedance contrast between the thick salt package of the Ariri Formation at the top and the underlying carbonates of the BVF Fig 3A The reflectors terminations against this surface are mainly erosional truncations Fig 3C i with concordant pattern in some areas defining an unconformity at the top of the BVF and base of the Ariri Formation evaporites This unconformity was also recognized by Assine et al 2008 Both surfaces show a good match with the lithostratigraphic tops in the wells No significant thickening was recognized within the BVF indicating low tectonic activity during deposition The three-dimensional visualization of the Pre-Alagoas unconfor mity Fig 4A and of the top surface Fig 4B indicates the geomor phological similarities between them Thus the reminiscent morphology that controlled the deposition of the sag section has not changed during that time The isochronous map of the top and base 4 Results 4 1 Top and base of interval The basal surface of the study interval is an unconformity that sep arates the divergent configuration of the rift phase from the parallel Fig 4 3D view of A the

Formation ms 4 V P Sommer et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 118 2022 103947 surfaces Fig 4C shows that the central zone is shallower than the external zone on SEE In addition the Outer High Gomes et al 2002 Fainstein et al 2003 Carminatti et al 2008 is shown in the top surface map oriented SW-NE along the SEE zone which exerted an important control on the depositional pattern of the BVF The thickness map of the entire BVF Fig 4D corroborates with the previous figures providing that the thicker areas are located mostly at the center with a trend aligned to the Outer High and high values situated in the SW part of the study area This indicates also that the Outer High was already estab lished before the deposition of the BVF which it controlled since the initial deposition 4 3 Seismic units Tracking successive reflector terminations on specific surfaces allowed the characterization of three seismic surfaces SS that separate four seismic stratigraphic units from Seismic unit 1 SU1 the oldest to Seismic unit 4 SU4 Fig 5 Seismic stratigraphic units are depositional units related to different temporal events Brown and Fischer 1977 Occasionally they are separated by unconformities surfaces but they can also mark only successive depositional events without changes in patterns and trends SU1 distribution is restricted to the southwest area while SU4 was affected by posterior erosional processes that limited its record Furthermore isochore maps Fig 6 were made in time milli seconds TWT to visualize the relative depth of the first occurrence and relative thickness of every seismic unit what allowed understanding of the tectonic-sedimentary evolution of the area SU1 lies upon the Pre-Alagoas unconformity and began its deposition by filling the lower regions of the southwest and limited by the structural high Outer High from central towards the east but overlying the Outer High in the southeast which is indicated by onlap terminations Addi tionally the Pre-Alagoas unconformity is marked by successive onlaps filling the lows as well as by restricted downlaps occurring in the highs Fig 5B i The top surface is called Seismic Surface 1 and separates SU1 from SU2 It is characterized by toplap terminations and some erosional truncations at the SE Fig 5B ii The area of occurrence of SU1 is limited to the southwest which indicates that the region is the lowest of the study interval The isochore map Fig 6A corroborates this showing that Seismic Unit 1 is thinner on the external areas while the probable depocenter is situated at the center of the southwest boundary of the study area The time-thickness values may exceed 240 ms TWT but their average is around 150 ms TWT SU2 covers the previous unit and lies upon the Pre-Alagoas uncon formity in the center and northeast areas Where SU2 lies upon SU1 its basal surface is called Seismic Surface 1 The main reflector terminations against this surface are downlaps Fig 5B i which occur in almost all the lines Its top surface is Seismic Surface 2 The top terminations against this surface are erosional truncations at the center part Fig 5B 4 2 Reflections terminations Along the 0575 regional seismic line Fig 3A the reflections pre dominantly show concordance and parallelism This indicates a tabular relatively flat deposition without prominent syn-depositional differen tial subsidence Additionally the thinning of the BVF interval towards SE indicates together with the successive basal onlaps a depositional advance towards the basement high Outer High The main reflector terminations of Line 0575 are downlaps onlaps and toplaps occurring in almost all stratigraphic levels There is a predominance of onlaps against the topographic highs Fig 3C iv mostly upon the PreAlagoas unconformity which indicates a filling of already defined low areas Successions of toplaps and downlaps are the most common internally to the interval mostly in the center of the northwest area Fig 3A 2 The concordance of reflectors also occurs internally but is concentrated in the upper part near the top surface with high ampli tude reflectors Erosional truncations Fig 3C i are also present mainly at the upper part of the interval against the salt base as well as double terminations toplap-downlap The study interval becomes thinner towards the southeast where basal reflector terminations are predominantly onlap downlap Fig 5 Seismic line 0575 A in normal phase without interpretation B with the interpretation of reflectors termination and seismic stratigraphic units B-i Detailed NW part and B-ii detailed SE part 5 V P Sommer et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 118 2022 103947 Fig 6 Isochore maps of each of the seismic units identified in the study interval Units are in milliseconds TW i and toplaps Fig 5B at the SW and NE areas Although it occurs in almost the entire study area it is restricted by the Outer High except on the NE to extreme east connection The time-thickness varies exceeding 300 ms TWT in some places but the average is around 150 ms TWT like in SU1 As seismic unit 1 SU2 is thicker in the southwest region Fig 6B SU3 due to the constant rate of expansion in accommodation space is the first unit to cross the Outer High Fig 6C Its basal surface is defined by the top of SU2 SS2 and by the Pre-Alagoas unconformity upon the Outer High The basal reflectors terminations against the SS2 are predominantly downlaps with onlaps restricted to lows Fig 5B ii Where the basal surface is the Pre-Alagoas unconformity the termina tions are downlaps outside the Outer High and onlaps on the Outer High The top surface corresponds to the base of salt but also to SS3 which separates SU3 from SU4 The reflector terminations against those sur faces are somehow distinctive Erosional truncations are more common against the base of salt with few zones of concordance in the center and the SW area Fig 5B i Concordance of reflectors is also predominant against the SS3 but with toplap terminations mainly at the SW part Fig 5B i The top of the unit is preserved only where SU4 is pre served the rest was eroded Fig 6C shows that this unit is the thinnest of the interval with values of no more than 120 ms TWT Additionally SU3 does not show a main depocenter However there are some slightly thicker areas in the center and north of the study area and consistent thinning over the Outer High SU4 is restricted to the upper center of the seismic lines and its basal surface is SS3 Fig 5 The basal reflectors terminations correspond mainly to onlaps with zones of concordance Fig 5B i ii The top surface is the base of salt and is characterized by erosional truncation on the edge and concordance in the center Its occurrence is limited to the center of the study area along a north-south trend The average timethickness is about 100 ms TWT and the depocenter located in the northeast is over 160 ms TWT thick Fig 6D The interpretation of the isochore map is very limited owing to the erosion that affected this 6 V P Sommer et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 118 2022 103947 Fig 7C with an average of 1500 m in the study area The spatial arrangement of this seismic facies varies along the study interval with a tendency of concentration in the lower seismic units SU1 and SU2 Fig 8A SFA has no particular external geometry However it presents sheet and sheet drape geometries in parts of the seismic sections Seismic facies B SFB presents continuous reflectors with high to medium amplitude with large lateral continuity Fig 7C with an average of 3000 m This seismic facies is dominantly arranged as iso lated bodies with sheet geometry mainly in the upper seismic units SU3 and SU4 but also in the lower central zone of the study area Fig 8A unit and made it a relict Nevertheless SU4 is inferred to have been originally deposited throughout the entire study area due to a pro gressive increase in the accommodation space in the region and after that strongly eroded The reflectors show toplap terminations at the top and erosional truncations along the edge of the unit which is also pre sent on the top of SU3 Many erosional truncations were mapped on a traceable surface indicating a considerable erosional event between SU4 and the evapo rites of the Ariri Formation This erosional surface is continuous eroding much of SU4 in the southeast and northwest regions as well as part of SU3 in the south and southeast region The many erosional truncations their distribution and recurrence and the vertical erosion define the surface separating the top of SU4 and the base of Ariri Formation evaporites as an at least local unconformity widespread along the entire Tupi Field area 4 5 Chronostratigraphic chart A chronostratigraphic chart was built from individualized seismic units according to the procedures of Vail et al 1977 and originally proposed by Wheeler 1958 The observation of their geometries pro vides the paleogeomorphological context of deposition The spatial dis tribution of units shows the architectural arrangement of the deposition system during basin filling and the stacking of units through their relative age allowing the perception of the temporal control on depo sition Thus the chronostratigraphic diagram facilitates the visualiza tion of the relationship between deposition erosion and temporal gaps No geological time average or individual dating of the stratigraphic units was performed No internal radiometric isotope datable layers were identified and biostratigraphic zonation was not the subject of this work But further analysis may be incorporated increasing the definition of the relative time zones here discussed The Pre-Alagoas unconformity separates the syn-rift deposits controlled by mechanical subsidence from the sag deposits controlled by thermal subsidence As sag basins are formed by a lithospheric rebound Brune et al 2014 SU1 represents the beginning of a new generation of accommodation space in the basin The deposition of the BVF began with the filling of lower areas controlled by the topography inherited from the rift structures and the Pre-Alagoas unconformity SU1 deposited above the Pre-Alagoas unconformity and onlapping the Outer High Fig 8 SU2 lies above the previous unit and its deposition is very 4 4 Seismic facies Seismic facies are normally determined as patterns related to archi tectural elements depositional systems or sedimentary environments depending on the scale and resolution of the data Seismic facies are defined by the combination of seismic data and well information in order to characterize a set of three-dimensional seismic units comprising groups of reflectors with behavioral parameters that differ from the adjacent units Brown and Fischer 1977 In this study the main types of seismic features applied in the recognition and mapping of seismic facies were i seismic amplitude ii continuity of reflectors iii geometry of reflectors and iv seismic frequency properties For this the attribute cosine of phase and trace AGC Amplitude Gain Control were used together with the normal phase to define two seismic facies Fig 7 The information obtained from seismic recognition was integrated with well data to build a seismic facies model that allowed correlation with the lithological composition of the BVF in the study area Seismic facies A SFA comprises discontinuous to semi-continuous reflectors with low to medium amplitude and small lateral continuity Fig 7 Seismic line 0575 illustrating a representative seismic section and the description of the seismic facies defined in the sag interval of the Tupi Field 7 V P Sommer et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 118 2022 103947 Fig 8

layers and C the chronostratigraphic diagram indicating the time relationship between depositional events of the seismic units and seismic facies constituted by a combination of laminations and peloids of magnesian clays dominantly stevensite kerolite and saponite with calcite spherulites and feathery fascicular aggregates that replaced displaced and encrusted the Mg-clays The Mg-clays were preferentially dissolved and or replaced by silica dolomite and other minerals during further diagenesis The rocks constituted essentially by laminated magnesian clays with subordinate amounts of terrigenous silt and clays and by replacive microcrystalline calcite dolomite and silica are termed mudstones Rocks formed mostly by calcite spherulites with variable amounts of intersti tial clays are termed spherulstones Rocks whose main constituents are fascicular calcite shrubs are termed shrubstones De Ros and Oliveira in prep Frequently intercalated with the in-situ deposits there are resedi mented deposits constituted by intraclasts of reworked spherulites fascicular shrubs laminated clays and their replacement products Ex amples of the characteristic Pre-salt lithologies in the study area can be seen in Fig 9 The best reservoirs are mainly represented by fascicular crusts with growth-framework inter-aggregate porosity and by intra clastic calcarenites and calcirudites with interparticle porosity e g Herlinger et al 2017 Wright and Barnett 2017 2020 Gomes et al 2020 Carvalho et al 2022 Owing to the magnesian composition of the clays and the lack of potassium in their structure as well as to their heterogeneous often intense replacement by calcite dolomite and sil ica conventional petrophysical logs and composite logs based on the description of cuttings are useless to define the lithological types of the Pre-salt deposits The examination of photomicrographs from five selected cored wells along the study area revealed that the defined seismic facies are not corresponding to the simple distribution-specific lithologies but rather to different patterns of combination and to the predominance of certain lithologic types in relation to others The discontinuous low-amplitude character of Seismic Facies A Fig 10 corresponds to a predominance similar to SU1 filling the lows and predominantly onlapping the Outer High It is possible to say that the expansion rate of accommodation space stayed constant due to similarities seen in Fig 4C SU3 is the first to surpass the structural high at NE It has a broad occurrence in the study area and has many erosional truncations along its top The up permost unit SU4 is a relict due to extensive post-depositional erosion which removed most of it leaving just thin preserved remnants in the study area This erosional process occurred before the deposition of the Ariri Formation evaporites This erosion affected almost all SU4 and a great part of the upper SU3 Fig 8C Therefore it can be inferred that after a progressive increase in the accommodation space from SU1 to SU4 there was a significant uplift and or lake level fall before the precipitation of the Ariri salts The general interplay between the recognized seismic facies in dicates a complex relation of SFB with SFA The SFB appears as isolated bodies in all seismic units but with a stratigraphic control of its occur rence Fig 8C They are situated predominantly along the base of SU1 at de center of SU2 as dispersed bodies in SU3 and through most of SU4 particularly at the highs Fig 8 5 Discussion 5 1 Lithologic characteristics of the

et al 2022 Wright 2022 According to these authors the fascicular shrubs are a product of abiotic calcite precipitation in the relatively higher portions of a wide lacustrine system owing to supersaturation promoted by evaporation and CO2 degassing The intraclastic deposits were generated by reworking of the in situ spherulitic and fascicular deposits by waves and or currents also preferentially in the shallower portions of the lacustrine system Therefore the distribution of the defined BVF seismic facies is consistent with the interpreted genesis of their predominant lithologic types and with the relative depth of the lacustrine system This even considering that the in-situ lithologies are not corresponding to purely depositional facies but rather to the combination of depositional con ditions i e the preferential deposition and preservation of magnesian clays matrix in relatively deeper areas with the eodiagenetic to syn genetic precipitation of calcite fascicular shrubs or spherulites Furthermore the genetic processes of the lithologic types predominating in SFB would explain its continuous and high amplitude pattern in the seismic lines as the shrubstones are apparently a product of laterally continuous precipitation of fascicular crusts with coalescing calcite ag gregates and scarce clays features also exhibited by the redeposited intraclastic calcarenites and calcirudites Conversely in the spherul stones of SFA the calcite aggregates are typically less coalesced frequently separated by the Mg-clay matrix These observations and interpretations agree with the detailed quantitative petrographic and petrophysical study of the Tupi Field recently published by Carvalho et al 2022 internal unconformities or erosional truncations within the interval 2 The absent or limited syn-depositional faulting and the remark able regional continuity of the seismic units indicate a very limited tectonic activity during the deposition of the BVF in the area 3 Based on these conditions the Outer High seems to be already formed before BVF deposition syn-rift and or during the for mation of the Pre-Alagoas unconformity Although minor uplift or accommodation creation may have occurred during the sag interval there was neither major contemporaneous tectonic ac tivity nor divergent reflection patterns The deposition of the BVF seismic units occurred in a clear onlapping pattern over the Outer High 4 A widespread unconformity marks the top of BVF with several successive erosional truncations This erosion affects mainly the top of SU4 but also SU3 The deposition of the Ariri Formation evaporites started over this unconformity 5 This unconformity may indicate a local uplift close to the Outer High or and a general base level fall preceding the large marine transgression which generated the thick evaporitic deposits 6 The lithological composition of the BVF is essentially constituted by magnesian clays calcite spherulites and fascicular shrubs but presents very complex facies variations resulting in patterns in undistinguishable conventional logs 7 However a clear differentiation can be made based on seismic texture analysis and seismic attributes defining two seismic facies SFA and SFB - with distinctive recognition parameters and very complex geometry 8 In general SFB occurs as isolated sheet-like zones within SFA preferentially along the relative highs and in SU4 9 Lithologic types recognized in five wells along the Tupi Field indicate that the defined seismic facies correspond to patterns of combination and distribution of dominant rock types 10 Seismic facies A corresponds mostly to calcite spherulites and Mgclays mud deposits which constitute the background of lacus trine sedimentation predominant and preferentially preserved in relatively lower areas of the system 11 Seismic facies B corresponds mostly to crusts of calcite fascicular shrubs formed as syngenetic to eodiagenetic precipitates and to resedimented deposits made of spherulitic and fascicular intraclasts 12 The complex distribution both laterally and temporally between the seismic facies suggests a complex origin related to the com bination of depositional and diagenetic processes essentially as a product of chemical abiotic generation in an alkaline lacustrine environment and to sublacustrine reworking 13 The mainly post-depositional configuration of the Tupi Field area along with the continuity and onlap patterns of seismic units onto a high remaining of post-rift erosion support a shallow evaporitic lake model rather than a deep lake with microbial platforms 5 2 Depositional model for the Barra Velha Formation in the Tupi Field Various authors suggested different models for the deposition of the BVF during the Aptian sag phase While some interpreted that the BVF was deposited in a large shallow evaporitic lake environment Pietzsch et al 2018 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Wright 2022 others defend a deep lacustrine system with microbial platforms Buckley et al 2015 Faria et al 2017 Minzoni et al 2020 The shallow evaporitic lake model explains most Pre-Salt major structures as product of mainly post-depositional faulting including local inversion erosion and rota tion of onlap terminations The deep lake model mainly considers the relief at the base of the salt and some clinoforms as prograding structures associated with carbonate platforms and buildups The mainly post-depositional configuration of the Tupi Field area along with the continuity and onlap patterns of seismic units onto a high remaining of post-rift erosion support a shallow evaporitic lake model rather than a deep lake with microbial platforms This interpretation is also supported by the detailed petrographic and faciologic study recently published by Carvalho et al 2022 In addition to that there is no evidence or even stratigraphic potential for the BVF carbonate system to develop such buildup structures in the study area Barnett et al 2018 proposed a model of subaerial erosion and alluvial gravitational redeposition for the intraclastic BVF deposits However the configura tion of BVF seismic facies SFA and SFB with a large distribution of resedimented rocks and lack of subaerial features does not support this model neither for the Tupi Field nor for the B zios Field Ferreira

FO A B S T R A C T Keywords Isotope geochemistry Carbonate geochemistry Strontium isotopes Numerical modelling Biostratigraphy Sedimentary basins Large oil accumulation discoveries in the last decade in the pre-salt rock succession o the Brazilian coast aroused renewed interest in carbonate reservoirs prompting several studies aiming at unravelling the conditions of formation of these rocks Despite that there are still many gaps in the knowledge concerning environmental conditions of the deposition of the pre-salt carbonates of Santos Basin located at the southeastern Brazilian margin In this study we present and discuss a new suite of geochemical and biostratigraphic data of the lacustrine rift to post-rift succession broadly correlated with Itapema and Barra Velha Formations of the Santos Basin whose deposition occurred in the Aptian The integration of the petrographic biostratigraphic and geochemical data serves the ultimate purpose of the study which is to apply the new radiogenic strontium data as a proxy for the reconstruction of the evolution of the lake hydrology associated with the deposition of the carbonates of the Itapema and Barra Velha Formations These data are integrated into numerical models whose results bring new ideas on the general hydrologic conditions of the lake system and on its evolution through time The mass balance calculations indicate that two end-members alone can account as potential sources of Sr to the palaeolake a ma c and a felsic component respectively The latter likely contributed with signi cantly higher uxes roughly one to two and up to four orders of magnitude higher than the former end-member for most of the depositional history in order to generate the 87Sr 86Sr trends observed in the carbonate rocks Finally the results obtained from the integration of the observations with the numerical models point to decreasing uxes of water with time as contributed from both sources suggesting that the formation of the deposits became very likely constrained to progressively more evaporitic and alkaline lake waters These results also open up a new window into the environmental conditions of the interior Gondwana continent immediately prior to the de nitive opening of the South Atlantic Ocean 1 Introduction The geological and environmental conditions during the Early Cretaceous in the interior of the Gondwana continent which led to the deposition of thick lacustrine carbonate sequences prior to the de nitive opening of the South Atlantic Ocean are not well constrained The discovery of a giant oil province composed by pre-salt lacustrine carbonate reservoirs in the last decade referred to as the pre-salt of Santos Basin in the Brazilian southeastern margin aroused renewed interest to understand the conditions in

compared to those from marine basins because of limited fetch reducing wave action and producing a shallow wave base This is especially the case in low gradient endorheic lakes in which rapid lake

packages of grainstone and rudstone comprising fragments of crystal shrubs spherulites intraclasts and in some cases peloids and volcanic fragments Grainstones and rudstones of this type occur in two distinct settings 1 the escarpment and dip slopes of tilted fault blocks along which a marked thinning of the Barra Velha Fm is evident 2 apparent debris aprons adjacent to seismically resolvable

deposits and constitute significant potential targets Introduction and Geological Setting The Barra Velha Formation of the Santos Basin is Aptian in age and lies within the Brazilian Alagoas Stage Fig 1 Moreira et al 2007 It is bounded at its base by the Pre-Alagoas unconformity that separates the Alagoas from the underlying Jiquia Stage and the distinctive microbialite lake system from the older lithologically more varied mollusc coquina-bearing lakes It is overlain by the evaporites of the Ariri Formation which marks the initial influx of marine waters into the Santos Basin Davison et al 2012 The Barra Velha Formation is also internally divisible by the Intra-Alagoas unconformity which separates the informally defined Rift microbialite below from the Sag microbialite above The thickness of the Barra Velha Formation varies significantly across the basin from 500 metres to 25 metres on fault block highs along which it may be locally absent Evidence acquired to date supports a non-marine origin for the Barra Velha Formation Wright Barnett 2015 1 Marine fossils are absent including typical restricted marine indicators such as miliolid foraminifera 2 Ostracods are locally present but are forms that have a wide salinity tolerance and appear to be non-marine 3 Early sulphate minerals such as gypsum and anhydrite are absent suggesting that the carbonates were not sourced from marine waters 4 87Sr 86Sr values are significantly more radiogenic than those for Cretaceous seawater Fig 2 Fig 1 Stratigraphic chart for the Lower Cretaceous of the Santos Basin Fig 2 87Sr 86Sr

Lithofacies and Cycles An examination and statistical analysis of 3 km of cored section shows that the basic components and facies described opposite Fig 3 are arranged into decimeter- to metre-scale cycles cf Wright Barnett 2014 2015 Fig 4 The basal portions of the cycles are composed of laminated calcimudstones with demonstrably early silica nodules and common vertebrate remains including locally well-preserved fish This facies association is interpreted to represent a flooding pluvial event and a resulting increase in lake level This is supported by the matrix-supported texture of the facies suggesting low energy conditions below both fair-weather and storm wave base A freshening of lake waters is indicated by the presence of precompaction silica nodules silica precipitation is favoured by a lowering of alkalinity and an abundance of fish remains including well-preserved whole fossils Alkalinity of pH 9-10 is harmful to many extant freshwater fish and values 10 are typically lethal Alabaster Lloyd 1980 compare conditions for precipitation of Mg-silicate clay below The middle parts of the cycles are composed of spherulitedominated facies in-situ pseudo boundstones lacking Mgsilicate clay or floatstones with Mg-silicate clays for a discussion of the terminological problems associated with these textures see Wright Barnett 2017a b and or re-worked grainstones rudstones Re-worked carbonate spherules also occur in wackestone packstone textures but are comparatively rare The up-section transition from laminated calcimudstones to spherulite-dominated lithologies is transitional and is marked by rare laminae of carbonate spherules within the calcimudstones which become progressively more abundant eventually forming the spherulite-dominated facies described above This facies association is interpreted to represent evaporation of the lake water body and a concomitant decrease in lake level This is suggested by the widespread presence of stevensite and other Mg-silicate clay minerals in this facies association In fact available evidence suggests that a Mgsilicate matrix was originally ubiquitous and was subsequently removed by dissolution Wright Barnett 2015 2017a b 3 - Shrubs Lithofacies Association 2- Spherulites Lithofacies Calcimudstones 1 A Massive to poorly laminated B Well-developed lamination with synsedimentary deformation features C

C Spherulitic wackestone floatstone with clay matrix in-situ D Spherulitic wackestone packstone with micrite matrix re-worked Crystal Shrubs 4 - Microbialites The abiotic precipitation of stevensite would require elevated pH conditions of at least 9 or above in palaeo-lake water Jones 1986 Khoury et al 1982 Wilson 2013 Tutulo Tosca 2018 suggest that spherulitic carbonates and Mg-silicate clays like those observed in the Barra Velha Formation were likely precipitation from elevated pH ca 10-10 5 waters based on their real-time observations of in-situ fluid chemistry post-experiment analysis of precipitated solids and geochemical modelling That the spherulite-dominated facies association represents less hospitable higher pH conditions is supported by the paucity of well-preserved vertebrates and their stratigraphic restriction to the lower parts of individual beds near or at the laminitespherulite transition Progressive evaporation of a common water body is also suggested by carbon and oxygen stable isotope data The isotopic composition of primary carbonates moves along a covariant trend in response to changes in hydrological balance and water residence times Carbonates precipitated during periods of high lake level will in general plot towards the negative end of the trend those precipitated during lake level lows towards the positive end Talbot 1990 This is exactly

with or without Mg-silicate clay and or re-worked grainstones rudstones Re-worked shrubs also occur in wackestone packstone textures but as with the spherulitedominated facies are comparatively rare The up-section transition from spherulite- to shrub-dominated facies is transitional and in some occurrences the two components are interlaminated giving a mixed shrub-spherulite facies The transitional nature of this transition is also apparent at the porescale at which spherules are observed to become increasingly asymmetric representing a transitional spherule-shrub graintype The palaeo-environmental conditions that tend to favour shrub precipitation over that of spherules are unclear An additional facies forms the uppermost parts of the cycles but is only well-developed where

Barra Velha Formation can be interpreted in terms of the cycle model opposite locally thick decametre-scale continuous packages of grainstone and rudstone occur comprising fragments of crystal shrubs spherulites intraclasts and in some cases peloids and volcanic fragments These cannot be readily explained by the cycle model because lacustrine shoreline grainstones and rudstones tend to be relatively thin compared to those from marine basins due to limited fetch reducing wave action and producing a shallow wave base This effect is especially marked in low gradient endorheic lakes in which rapid lake level oscillations preclude the development of a stable shoreline Grainstones and rudstones of this type occur in two distinct settings 1 associated with unconformities on the

narrow elongate fault blocks 1 Grainstones Associated with Unconformities and Stratal Thinning Grainstones and rudstones associated with unconformities and thinning of the Barra Velha Formation form sharp-based packages mostly showing fining-upwards trends Grain-size is mainly medium- to coarse-grained but is locally up to granule- to pebble size in the rudstone textures at the base of fining-upwards packages Grain-size also shows a relationship to structural setting with grainstones deposited on steeper escarpment slopes being coarse than those on gentler dip slopes Component grains are generally well sorted and wellrounded The dominant physical sedimentary structures are planar and low-angle stratification but cross-lamination and planar cross-bedding is locally present Palaeocurrents are normal to palaeoslope and show a radial pattern Core plug measurements indicate porosities of up to 25 but moderate permeability ranging from 1 mD to ca 100 mD Dip slope Escarpment slope C 200 m B Cyclic lake deposits A Frequencies Grainstones of this type are interpreted as carbonate fan delta shorelines with wave reworked sheet flood or terminal splay deposits This is consistent with the radial palaeoslope-normal palaeocurrent patterns the degree of grain abrasion and the thickness of the grainstone successions which would be more difficult to explain in a wholly lacustrine environment The escarpment slope vs dip slope grain-size variations are analogous to those observed in silicilclastic alluvial fan environments in which steeper depositional gradients are

features comprise grainstones rudstones and less commonly packstones and floatstones The dominant grain-types are re-worked shrubs with platy angular and well-rounded intraclasts mainly comprising cm-

Petrogal Brasil Maria Olho Azul Petrogal Brasil Wagner Moreira Lupinacci UFF Leandro Machado Paradigm Summary Brazil began oil production from its pre-salt carbonate reservoirs in 2008 Recently these reservoirs have reached an incredible output of 1 53 million barrels of oil equivalent per day boed representing more than half of the country s daily production The rapid and high increase in oil production demonstrates how important these carbonate reservoirs are to Brazil The Brazilian pre-salt oil fields are in an exploration and development phase which requires an understanding of the complex geology of these areas There are many challenges for characterizing carbonate rocks given their high spatial heterogeneity and complex pore systems The main objective of this study was to propose a workflow for identifying and characterizing carbonate bodies using a combination of structural attributes and the hybrid spectral decomposition method on these potential targets in the exploration of hydrocarbons Introduction Carbonate mounds are potential oil-producing systems in many fields Identifying and characterizing carbonate mounds in the Brazilian Pre-Salt below complex and thick evaporite deposits are considerable challenges for geoscientists One of the major problems is seismic illumination of subsalt layers Carbonate reservoirs in these areas are difficult to identify and delineate using seismic data because of their complex pattern of facies and the absence of impedance contrast between the reservoir and the sealing facies Zheng 2007 Seismic attenuation can greatly affect the quality of the seismic signal at considerable depths because of cumulative effects during down-going and up-going wave-field propagation Lupinacci and Oliveira 2015 making data preconditioning crucial Lupinacci et al 2017 According to Chopra and Marfurt 2007 a seismic attribute is any measure of the seismic data that helps to visually enhance or quantify features of interest Seismic attributes are important tool used for reservoir characterization However selection of seismic attributes should be made with caution so as not to propagate false interpretations Carbonate mounds are complex sedimentary bodies that can be characterized by a combination of seismic patterns Generally their seismic facies are associated with chaotic subparallel wavy and concave seismic patterns Carrillat 2002 Seismic multiattributes analysis can contribute to identifying these patterns 2017 SEG SEG International Exposition and 87th Annual Meeting Coherence attributes that compare neighboring seismic traces based on waveforms using cross-correlation semblance and eigen structure measures along the dip and azimuth of seismic reflectors have been developed Bahorich and Farmer 1995 Marfurt et al 1998 Marfurt et al 1999 Gerztenkorn and Marfurt 1999 In recent years coherence attributes have been applied to the margins of the Atlantic Basin in order to obtain accurate imaging profiles of the fault patterns infor hydrocarbon reservoirs that are difficult to identify from seismic reflectivity data The curvature attribute is a two-dimensional property that describes how bent a curve is at a particular point along its length Roberts 2001 focusing more on changes in shape rather than amplitude Thus this attribute is not affected by variation of amplitude in relation to fluids nor changes in lithology so it is a good identifier of faults as well as anticline and syncline structures Pascal 2008 However the curvature attribute is sensitive to noise Curvature attributes can increase confidence in the coherence results from geological analyses Spectral decomposition is another widely-used attribute In seismic data it can represent the seismic trace in a frequency domain or in sub-bands of frequencies It can identify subtle thickness variations and discontinuities as well as also accurately and quantitatively predict bedding thicknesses e g Partyka 1999 Low-frequency shadow is also used as a hydrocarbon indicator when applying the spectral decomposition attribute in hydrocarbon detection studies Sun et al 2002 Wang 2007 Additionally a hybrid spectral decomposition attribute basically uses the result of spectral decomposition and selects the most important frequency bandwidth which may be related to reservoir facies Then a specific amplitude range that represents a reservoir anomaly can be isolated Here we propose a workflow for identifying and extracting mound geobodies in carbonate reservoirs Our workflow uses the coherence and dip curvature

High-resolution seismic data enable visualization and quantitative analysis of geometry orientation and spatial distribution of carbonate mounds Ruf 2012 Identification of geometric features as well as mounds is a considerable challenge in the Brazilian Pre-Salt formations due to difficulties in imaging seismic facies below large salt structures Mapping of carbonate mounds would improve the ability to predict possible areas for hydrocarbon exploration The workflow we used for characterization of carbonate mounds is shown in Figure 1 In this workflow the seismic data is preconditioned to optimize the attribute calculations to improve the signal noise ratio and to increase vertical resolution To do this Structure Oriented Filtering SOF is used on the Reverse Time Migration RTM seismic volume to reduce noise and to improve the continuity termination and geometry of events which allows better definition of the reservoir architecture We then calculated the Dip Curvature Attributes

amthor shell com raphael camara shell com ABSTRACT Potential reservoir facies represented by lacustrine shoreline grainstones and rudstones are typically relatively thin compared to those from marine basins because of limited fetch and reduced wave action producing a shallow wave base This is especially the case in low- gradient endorheic lakes in which rapid lake-level oscillations preclude the development of a stable shoreline However the closed lake deposits of the Barra Velha Formation locally have thick decameter-scale continuous packages of grainstones and rudstones comprising fragments of crystal shrubs spherulites intraclasts and in some cases peloids and volcanic fragments Grainstones and rudstones of this type occur on the escarpment and dip slopes of tilted fault blocks along which a marked thinning of the Barra Velha Formation is evident They mainly consist of sharp-based decimeter-to-meter scale fining-upward packages with well-sorted and well-rounded grains planar low-angle lamination and less commonly cross-lamination and planar cross-bedding Those that occur on dip slopes are generally finer than those associated with escarpment slopes the latter also being texturally less mature At the formation scale grainstone-dominated successions show radial depositional dip azimuth patterns orientated normal to paleoslope The grainstones are interpreted as wave-dominated fan-delta shoreline deposits Although much effort has focused on the origin of the in situ components of the Barra Velha Formation such as crystal shrub facies detrital deposits of the type documented here constitute significant potential targets Copyright 2021 by The American Association of Petroleum Geologists DOI 10 1306 13722318MSB 6 1853 155 156 BARNETT ET AL INTRODUCTION The pre-salt successions of the Santos Basin contain estimated recoverable hydrocarbon volumes in excess of 30 BBOE according to Agencia Nacional do Petroleo The majority of these volumes are hosted in the Barra Velha Formation BVF Consequently the BVF and equivalent units have been the focus of considerable research efforts not just in Brazilian basins but also along the conjugate margin e g Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Saller et al 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 However most of this research has been aimed at understanding the unusual in situ carbonate components despite the fact that these are commonly reworked and locally form thick decameter-scale successions of detrital deposits which can also have good reservoir properties Barnett et al 2018 Explaining thick decameter-scale continuous packages of grain-supported detrital carbonate rocks in apparent lacustrine settings is difficult because the limited fetch that characterizes lacustrine basins compared to marine basins results in reduced wave action and a relatively shallow wave base This effect is especially marked in low-gradient endorheic lakes in which rapid lake-level oscillations preclude the development of a stable shoreline Talbot and Allen 1996 As a result lacustrine shoreline g rainstones tend to be relatively thin the thickest units ca 14 m known to the authors being those documented by Milroy and Wright 2000 The aim of this chapter is to document the structural and stratigraphic setting of thick stacked successions of grainstones and rudstones from a producing field in the Santos Basin Figure 1 and based on their Figure 1 Base salt top reservoir structure map showing the structure and the location of the wells used in this study Contour interval is 100 m A A is the line of the seismic section shown in Figure 4 Origin and Significance of Thick Carbonate Grainstone Packages in Nonmarine Successions Barra Velha Formation 157 sedimentological characteristics propose a depositional model for their genesis GEOLOGICAL SETTING The BVF of the Santos Basin Figure 2 is Aptian in age and lies within the Brazilian Alagoas stage Moreira et al 2007 see Tedeschi et al 2017 for an alternative age interpretation It is underlain by the Pre- Alagoas unconformity PAU that separates the Alagoas from the underlying Jiquia stage Published studies to date suggest that the formation is mainly lacustrine in origin Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Pietzsch et al 2018 Farias et al 2019 but differs from the older and more heterogeneous bivalve coquina- bearing lake deposits of the Itapema Formation and is overlain by the evaporites of the Ariri Formation representing the initial influx of seawater into the S antos Basin Davison et al 2012 Within the BVF there is also an intraformational unconformity the Intra- Alagoas unconformity IAU However the same basic facies occur either side of this surface although their proportions may vary The BVF ranges in thickness from less than 25 m or is missing on fault-block highs to greater than 550 m Barnett et al 2018 Evidence acquired to date supports a nonmarine origin for the BVF Wright and Barnett 2015 Pietzsch et al 2018 1 Marine fossils are absent including typical restricted marine indicators such as miliolid foraminifera 2 Ostracods are locally present and all documented taxa are nonmarine 3 Early sulfate minerals such as gypsum and anhydrite are absent suggesting that the carbonates were not sourced from marine waters 4 87Sr 86Sr values are significantly more radiogenic than those for Cretaceous seawater Following deposition in a synrift to sag-tectonic setting the BVF and its equivalents were buried by more than 1 km of marine evaporites of the Ariri Formation because the Albian ocean expanded into the basin Figure 2 Lower Cretaceous stratigraphic chart for the Santos Basin after Moreira et al 2007 Winter et al 2007 158 BARNETT ET AL THE BARRA VELHA FORMATION Although the main components have been discussed by Wright and Barnett 2015 when there were restrictions on publishing images since then several authors have described and illustrated similar textures from the BVF in the Santos Basin Tanaka et al 2018 Farias et al 2019 Wright and Barnett 2020 and equivalents of the BVF in the Campos and Kwanza basins Saller et al 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Terra et al 2010 also provided core and photomicrograph images of the key components These basic components and their mode of occurrence can be used to define a lithofacies scheme as shown in Table 1 and are described in more detail below The BVF carbonates typically consist of a c entimeter-to-decimeter bedded highly heterogeneous mix of in situ and reworked grains and a mineralogy comprising calcite dolomite Mg-silicate clays mainly stevensite and talc silica and commonly significant porosity The dominant primary calcite components consist of in situ and reworked material of two basic types millimeter-to-centimeter sized fascicular structures resembling crystal shrubs Lithofacies Association 3 Table 1 locally present as Lithofacies Association millimeter-thick laminae of coalesced fibrous calcite and millimeter-scale spherulites Wright and Barnett 2015 Figures 3 7 Lithofacies Association 2 Table 1 These two components in their in situ or reworked forms are commonly interbedded with laminated calcimudstones Lithofacies Association 1 Table 1 see discussion below Despite the common informal use of the term to denote the BVF microbialites in the sense of Burne and Moore 1987 are exceedingly rare in the BVF Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 but do occur as m icrobial crinkly laminites stromatolites

values for the frequency of microbial macrostructures and microstructures in the large set of BVF samples they studied emphasizing the rarity of such material An examination and statistical analysis of greater than 3 km of core material show that the basic components and facies of the BVF are arranged into decimeter-to meter scale cycles Wright and Barnett 2015 Barnett et al 2018 Figure 3 The basal parts of the cycles are composed of laminated calcimudstones with demonstrable early silica nodules and Lithofacies 1 Calcimudstones A Massive to poorly laminated B Well-developed lamination

Grainstone Packages in Nonmarine Successions Barra Velha Formation 159 common vertebrate remains including locally well-preserved fish These facies are interpreted to represent a flooding pluvial event and a resulting increase in lake level This is supported by the matrix-supported texture of the facies suggesting low-energy conditions below both fair weather and storm wave base A freshening of lake waters is i ndicated by the p resence of pre-compaction silica nodules silica p recipitation is favored by a lowering of alkalinity an abundance of fish remains i ncluding well-preserved whole fossils and ostracods An a lkalinity of pH 9 10 is harmful to many extant freshwater fish and values greater than 10 are typically lethal Alabaster and Lloyd 1980 The middle parts of the cycles are c omposed of spherulite-dominated facies The up- s ection tr a n s i t i o n f ro m l a m i n a t e d c a l c i m u d s t o n e t o spherulite-dominated lithologies is transitional and is marked by rare laminae of carbonate spherulites within calcimudstones which become p rogressively more abundant eventually forming the s pherulite-dominated facies described earlier This facies association is interpreted to represent evaporation of the lake water body and a concomitant decrease in lake level This is suggested by the widespread presence of stevensite and other M g- silicate clay m inerals in this facies association The abiotic precipitation of stevensite would require elevated pH conditions of at least 9 or above in paleolake water Khoury et al 1982 Jones 1986 Wilson 2013 Tutolo and Tosca 2018 suggested that spherulitic carbonates and Mg-silicate clays like those observed in the BVF were likely precipitated from elevated pH ca 10 10 5 waters based on their real-time observations of in situ fluid chemistry post-experiment analysis of precipitated solids and geochemical modeling That the spherulite-dominated facies association represents less hospitable higher pH conditions is supported by the paucity of well-preserved vertebrates and their stratigraphic restriction to the lower parts of individual beds near or at the l aminite spherulite transition Progressive evaporation of a common water body is also suggested by carbon and oxygen stable isotope data Barnett et al 2018 The isotopic composition of primary carbonates moves along a covariant trend in response to changes in Figure 3 Idealized cycle showing the vertical arrangement of grain types and basic components in the Barra Velha Formation BVF together with a typical carbon and oxygen stable isotope profile The depositional textures within which the different grain types occur may vary as shown in Table 1 LA Lithofacies Association 160 BARNETT ET AL hydrological balance and water residence times Carbonates precipitated during periods of high lake level will in general plot toward the negative end of the trend those precipitated during lake-level lows toward the positive end Talbot 1990 This is exactly icrosampled laminites and calthe trend shown by m cite spherulites in the BVF Barnett et al 2018 The upper parts of the cycles are composed of shrub-dominated facies The up-section change from spherulite- to shrub-dominated facies is transitional and in some occurrences the two components are interlaminated giving a mixed shrub spherulite facies The gradual nature of this transition is also apparent at the pore scale at which spherulites are observed to become increasingly asymmetric representing a transitional spherulite shrub grain type The shrub-dominated facies of Lithofacies Association 3 are locally overlain by sharp-based beds of intraclast peloid grainstone Lithofacies Association 5 This latter lithofacies association is the focus of this chapter and is described in detail in subsequent sections DATA SET AND METHODOLOGY The seismic data set used in this study are a full stack Kirchhoff PSDM pre-stack depth migration acquired in 2008 and processed in 2011 This is supplemented by wireline log data from four wells here named as wells A B C and D Figure 1 Core was taken from well A and well C 111 8 m in total from the upper part of the BVF This has been supplemented by 251 rotary sidewall cores from wells B C and D Each of the cores has been described at 1 50 scale One hundred and ninety-seven core plug trims and all the side wall cores SWC trims have been examined and described petrographically Borehole image BHI logs were acquired and interpreted from wells A and C The BHI types used for interpretation were Baker Atlas Earth Imager and Circumferential Borehole Imaging Log EI and CBIL well A and Schlumberger s Ultrasonic Borehole Imager UBI well C Borehole image log data were loaded processed and quality checked in TerraStation Manual dips were then calculated directly from the images using TerraSciences software Structural dip was defined by well-bedded intervals assumed to have originally been deposited horizontally e g shales mudstones well-bedded carbonates The resulting structural dip was then removed from the manual dip data set to produce a derotated or residual dip data set which should best represent the depositional attitude of bedding THICK CARBONATE GRAINSTONES Although much of the BVF can be interpreted in terms of the cycle model described earlier locally thick decameter-scale continuous packages of grainstones and rudstones occur comprising fragments of crystal shrubs spherulites intraclasts and in some cases peloids and volcanic fragments These thick vertical successions of detrital grain-supported carbonate cannot be readily explained by simple cycles of lake-level increase followed by progressive evaporation prior to the next flooding event Barnett et al 2018 suggested that grainstones and rudstones of this type occur in two distinct structural and stratigraphic settings 1 Associated with unconformities on the escarpment and dip slopes of tilted fault blocks along which a marked thinning of the BVF is evident 2 Apparent debris aprons adjacent to seismically resolvable mounds that developed on narrow elongate fault blocks In this chapter we will limit our focus to the first of these The reader is referred to Barnett et al 2018 for more details of the second GRAINSTONES ASSOCIATED WITH UNCONFORMITIES AND STRATAL THINNING Description The grainstones documented in this chapter Lithofacies Association 5 Table 1 occur where the BVF progressively onlaps tilted fault blocks comprising older sedimentary or volcanic rocks as in Figure 4 In this tectono-stratigraphic setting the BVF thins significantly on the fault block crest Well p enetrations have locally proven as little as 25 m of BVF overlying volcanic rocks of the Cambori Formation Core and SWC data show that in areas where the BVF thins in this way the more commonly encountered cyclic successions described earlier are rare and instead successions dominated by grainstones and rudstones occur As already noted these successions are thin on fault block crests but thicken off structure both on the dip and escarpment slope such that successions more than 100 m thick occur which are greater than

the fining- upward ones Although cycle bases are sharp they are mainly planar with at most 1 or 2 cm of relief Fining upward in some cycles is sufficient that the uppermost parts show packstone textures with wispy argillaceous laminae Grain size is mainly medium to coarse grained but is locally up to granule to pebble size in the rudstone textures at the base of fining-upward packages Figures 6 8 Grain size shows a relationship to structural setting with grainstones deposited on steeper escarpment slopes apparently being coarser than those on gentler dip slopes Figure 6 In well C for example grain size is typically medium to coarse grained and rudstone textures are common Figure 6A whereas in well A grain size is typically fine to medium grained and rudstones are rare Figure 6B By far the dominant form of stratification is planar to low-angle lamination Figures 6 7A Planar cross-bedding also occurs maximum cross-bed set height is 0 45 m as does cross-lamination Figures 6 7B Only a single occurrence of trough cross- bedding has been observed with set heights of 0 25 m I rregular crinkly lamination locally occurs both at cycle tops and within cycles in some cases showing a tufted morphology Figure 7D Petrographic observations reveal that the laminae comprise micrite with porostromate-like structures in which the filament tubes are filled with calcite or silica cement Figure 9a b The grainstones comprise rounded to well-rounded and moderate to well-sorted fragments of shrubs spherulites recrystallized and heavily micritized carbonate grains of indeterminate origin showing variable rounding and grain size very fineto medium-grained peloids bone fragments and locally ostracods and clasts of basalt Figure 8 The degree of rounding and abrasion is such that the identification of shrub fragments is commonly only possible from their distinctive optical properties sweeping extinction with rare curved twin planes cleavage resembling both radiaxial fibrous

to be restricted to the middle and upper parts of cycles where grain size is medium to coarse grained or finer The coarser basal parts of fining-upward package show c entimeter-scale up to 8 cm in length angular to subangular platy intraclasts Figure 9 composed of the following 1 Reworked incipient shrub laminae and fibrous calcite mats 2 Recrystallized carbonate showing neosparitic textures locally with some remnants of clotted peloidal textures 3 Silicified clasts with clearly truncated margins 4 Laminated clotted peloidal micrite Clast types 1 to 3 also occur as more rounded grains in the sand to pebble grade fraction of grainstones and rudstones In addition to these commonly occurring centimeter-scale intraclasts very rare probable blocks of originally in situ shrub framestones up to 0 4 m in thickness locally occur An estimation of the width of these clasts is precluded by the limitation of borehole size The grainstones commonly have well-developed interparticle porosity

heavily compacted with common concavo-convex grain contacts Figure 8F P rimary interparticle porosity has in some samples been f urther enhanced by dissolution Micritized grains are locally intensely

Interpretation The progressive onlap thinning and change to demonstrably high-energy facies e g cross- bedded grainstones and rudstones with centimeter-scale intraclasts on the fault block crest indicate that this was a depositional paleo-high characterized by lower accommodation space and as such was at or near the local paleoshoreline of the BVF lake The radial depositional dip azimuth pattern encountered on the escarpment slope in well C and the dip slope in well A indicate that the grainstone-dominated succession in both locations has a fan-like morphology and dips down paleoslope into any c ontemporaneous lake The predominance of sharp-based decimeter-scale fining-upward successions points to a progressive 168 BARNETT ET AL decrease in wave and or current energy during deposition following an initial phase of erosion The absence of any significant relief or dip on the basal erosion surfaces suggests that the flows responsible were not confined to channels Episodic breaks in the deposition of detrital sediments is indicated by the colonization of the sediment surface by microbial mats as recorded by the presence of crinkly laminated micritic laminae with clotted peloidal and porostromate fabrics Lithofacies 4A Table 1 The presence of in situ shrub laminae within beds of grainstone and the local interbedding of other lacustrine facies Figures 5 6B Table 1 indicates that whatever the depositional environment of the grainstones it was time equivalent to and intimately associated with the better documented shrub spherulite and calcimudstone-dominated lithofacies associations Table 1 As noted earlier the dominant form of stratification is planar to low-angle lamination This preferentially occurs in the upper finer grained parts of the fining-upward cycles in well C and the generally finer grained grainstones of well A In sand-grade sediments that lack significant quantities of mica and are finer than ca 600 m flatbeds with parallel lamination indicate upper flow regime conditions Collinson and Mountney 2019 Many closed lakes in arid and semiarid climates are fringed by alluvial fans Talbot and Allen 1996 Renaut and Gierlowski-Kordesch 2010 The earlier observations would be consistent with sheet floods upward-fining cycles lack of evidence of channels upper flow regime conditions on an alluvial fan radial paleocurrent patterns orientated down paleoslope sourced from an upland composed of previously deposited lacustrine carbonates However other lines of evidence are inconsistent with this interpretation most notably the degree of rounding and sorting shown by the grainstones Because of the episodic nature of sediment transport and the limited sediment transport distance typical of alluvial fans the resulting deposits are commonly poorly sorted with variable grain rounding and sometimes a depositional silt- or clay-grade matrix In contrast one of the most striking characteristics of many of the grainstones described here is that they are remarkably well rounded and sorted with a high degree of grain sphericity Furthermore the scenario outlined earlier does not explain several features of the grainstones First the local presence of coated grains like superficial ooids testifies to prolonged continuous grain movement not the type of episodic transport characteristic of a flash flood Coated grains lack truncated cements and are not fragmented suggesting that they are formed in situ and were not reworked from preexisting limestones Second although paleocurrents from planar cross-bed sets in well C are consistent with radial down paleoslope flow on an alluvial fan Figure 10B those in well A show a marked southerly trend which would be oblique onshore to any downslope prograding fan at that location Figure 10D Planar lakeward-dipping lamination is typical of unidirectional backwash in foreshore environments and can also be caused by high-energy waves in the surf zone along both lacustrine and marine shorelines Reading and Collinson 1996 Collinson and Mountney 2019 Such an interpretation would not only explain basinward depositional dips Figure 10 but would also provide the more continuous agitation required to explain the textural maturity of the grainstones and the local presence of coated grains Furthermore oblique onshore paleocurrent patterns from planar cross-bedding can readily be explained by the wave-driven migration of sandwaves whereas downslope sediment transport by debris flows and sheet floods cannot The grainstones and rudstones described herein are therefore interpreted as high- energy wave-dominated shoreline deposits derived from the disaggregation and reworking of mainly shrub and spherulite-dominated limestones Prograding shoreline deposits in both siliciclastic Reading and Collinson 1996 and carbonate environments Ward and Brady 1979 Milroy and Wright 2000 typically show coarsening-upward trends The dominance of fining-upward trends in the BVF grainstones therefore requires some explanation One possibility is that they represent transgressive shoreline deposits recording lake deepening and shoreline retreat Indeed the progressive onlap of the BVF shown in Figure 4 indicates an overall transgressive trend at the formation 102 m scale However even within this longer term transgression one would expect higher frequency regressive events to produce smaller scale meter scale or thinner coarsening-upward packages especially if the BVF lake was subject to frequent flooding- evaporation cycles Figure 3 A nother possibility therefore is that the relative scarcity of coarsening- upward cycles is because of frequent cycle truncation by erosion prior to deposition of the following cycle This is supported by the sharp bases of each of the cycles and the immediately overlying intraclast lag Discussion The grainstones and rudstones documented in this chapter occur within successions greater than 160 m thick in which they make up well over 50 of the Origin and Significance of Thick Carbonate Grainstone Packages in Nonmarine Successions Barra Velha Formation 169 facies present Individual and continuous packages of stacked grainstones up to 15 4 m thick are observed in the cored interval of well C and if the sidewall core sampling in this well is representative then continuous successions of grainstone may exceed 22 m Figure 5 Furthermore the grainstone-dominated facies belt extends ca 40 km along strike Figure 1 Consequently grainstones of the type described earlier are locally at least a major component of the BVF depositional system and can form high-quality reservoirs Some of the samples described in this chapter have porosity up to 19 Nevertheless they have received little attention in previous studies with most workers focusing on the in situ components of the BVF and similar age-equivalent units especially the shrubs and spherulites e g Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 Successions greater than 160 m thick dominated by high-energy grainstone deposits would be noteworthy in a marine basin cf Burchette et al 1990 However they are particularly unusual in a lacustrine basin where the relatively limited fetch would result in reduced wave energy compared to marine equivalents This is especially true in low-gradient closed or endorheic lakes in which rapid and frequent lake level changes can prevent the establishment of stable shorelines Talbot and Allen 1996 Although the gradient of the BVF lake clearly varied through time because of both local faulting and the regional shift from rifting to thermal sag subsidence many workers favor a closed lake depositional environment especially for that part of the formation above the IAU Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Pietzsch et al 2018 Farias et al 2019 Consequently the origin of thick stacked high-energy grainstones in both footwall and hanging wall structural settings requires some explanation In the preceding section we concluded that the grainstones were produced by the reworking of mainly shrub and spherulite-dominated deposits along a high-energy shoreline At the formation scale depositional dips within grainstone-dominated successions show a radial fan-like and lakeward-dipping pattern in wells drilled on both the escarpment and dip slopes Figure 10A C The grainstone bodies therefore appear to have a lobate or fan-like morphology However a mechanism is required to generate and concentrate large amounts of carbonate sand and gravel at the shoreline to produce successions of the type and thickness described Although waves are important in reworking winnowing and transporting sediment they are unlikely to be an efficient mechanism for concentrating significant thicknesses of sand and gravel at one location because as already noted the fair weather wave base is likely to migrate laterally over considerable distances in response to rapid and frequent lake-level changes All of the earlier observations can be reconciled in a fan delta environment In this chapter we follow McPherson et al 1987 in defining a fan delta as an ater alluvial fan that builds into a standing body of w It follows from this definition and the observation that alluvial fans commonly occur along the margins of closed lakes in arid and semiarid climates that fan deltas are similarly common in such settings The presence of water bodies marginal to fans can affect fan development in several ways Of relevance in this case is the fact that fans can be significantly eroded by waves or longshore currents where they adjoin a water body and beach shoreface or longshore drift deposits such as spits may develop Where this is observed to occur the resulting deposits show significantly greater textural maturity than upslope alluvial fan deposits that have not been subject to waves or longshore currents Horton and Schmitt 1996 Blair and McPherson 2008 As such a fan delta environment provides the necessary mechanism for the degree of sorting and rounding observed in the BVF grainstones as wells as the suite of observed sedimentary structures and the fanlike morphologies of the grainstone- dominated successions Such a setting is also consistent with the cycle truncation proposed in the preceding section to explain the dominance of fining-upward over coarsening-upward packages Repeated erosion and r eworking of shoreline deposits by flash floods would be expected in a fan-delta environment Horton and Schmitt 1996 propose a similar mechanism to explain the apparent absence of progradational coarsening-upward cycles in siliciclastic fan-delta shoreline facies Furthermore pronounced changes in water depth as is typical in closed lakes can cause significant fan erosion and reworking over a large range of elevation For example in Walker Lake Nevada the position of wave reworking fluctuated over a vertical range of 157 m during the past 18 kyr producing complex interfingering of subaerial and lake shoreline facies across a 1700 m radial belt In other words a fan delta provides a mechanism for both the disaggregation and concentration of thick accumulations of sediment by subaerial erosion and downslope sediment transport as well as the intense winnowing of that sediment by waves on the distal nearshore part of the fan A possibly analogous environment is observed at Winnemucca Lake in Nevada where the subaerial exposure and subsequent erosion of spring mounds that developed in a sublacustrine environment between 13 Ka and 26 Ka have led to the development 170 BARNETT ET AL of prominent carbonate beach ridges Benson 2004 T C Blair 2019 personal communication Figure 11 The resulting beach gravels are mainly composed of fragment shrub and thinolite the dominant components of the spring mounds together with clasts of Miocene basalt Figure 11 Although not an active fan delta the gravels at Winnemucca Lake have some partial analogies with the interpretation presented here for the BVF grainstones They are the products of point sourcing from spring mounds subaerial disaggregation downslope sediment transport from older carbonates and the redistribution and winnowing of this material by waves at a lake shoreline with well-developed beach ridges and spits The high degree of textural maturity of some of the grainstone samples was highlighted in the p receding section see for example Figure 8A E F In fact the authors have rarely seen such uniformly d eveloped rounding and sphericity except in carbonate eolianites e g Dodd et al 1993 Barnett 2002 Dodd et al 1993 Figure 11 A Aerial photograph of part of Winnemucca Lake showing the carbonate spring mound at Needle Rock and t opographically

increases the roundness and sphericity of grains that were originally tabular because the low viscosity of air relative to water induces increased grain breakage and abrasion The current spherical morphology of grains that were originally elongated such as shrubs or bone fragments could be because of intense grain breakage and abrasion in an eolian environment prior to deposition The relatively long periods between major depositional episodes on the subaerial parts of fans or beach ridges make surficial sediment modification by secondary processes like wind commonplace In more extreme cases eolian sandsheets can form thick and laterally continuous blankets that disrupt or even terminate fan deposition Blair and McPherson 2009 Note that it is not being suggested that the grainstones described in this chapter are eolianites Clear examples of inversely graded laminae produced by the migration and climb of wind ripples climbing translatent stratification the most definitive criterion for recognizing eolianites regardless of original mineralogy Hunter 1977 Loope and Abegg 2001 are not common Conversely Kindler and Davaud 2001 observe that wind ripple strata are sometimes rare in carbonate eolianites that lack detrital quartz However adhesion ripples are also apparently absent and grains larger than ca 4 mm are common in rudstone fabrics at c ycle bases Both characteristics are inconsistent with an eolian depositional environment The idea that is being considered earlier is simply that the grain assemblage that now makes up the thick BVF grainstones was subject to eolian transport and resulting grain abrasion prior to deposition at the lake shoreline The apparent paucity of widespread paleosols in the BVF and equivalent units in the Campos Basin is surprising Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Herlinger et al 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 although the presence of paleokarst in BVF successions with locally occurring seismically resolvable mounds has been suggested by Barnett et al 2018 Very little is known of the time periods required for the formation of calcimagnesian soils that is soils developed on carbonate substrates Duchaufour 1982 Wright 1994 However because of the abundant supply of carbonate it is likely that they form much more abruptly than those that develop on siliciclastic substrates such as the well-dated calcretes of the southwest U S A Machette 1985 which can require 10 5 years to reach stage 4 Wright 1994 The above observation makes the lack of clear well-developed pedogenic features in the BVF even more unusual One possible explanation is the prevailing paleoclimate during BVF deposition Although a soil moisture deficit is necessary to allow carbonate to accumulate and not to be flushed out of an incipient soil profile calcimagnesian soils do not form in very arid settings because there is not enough water passing through the soil to dissolve sufficient quantities of carbonate Furthermore the role of organic processes is critical because much of the available carbonate is probably precipitated through biological activity Extreme aridity would suppress vegetation which in addition would also retard other pedogenic processes such as brecciation much of which is thought to be caused by plant roots Wright 1994 One other explanation for the scarcity of paleosols is that the grainstones described herein are not shallow-water deposits but were generated by deeper water currents cf Eberli et al 2019 However this is inconsistent with several features of the grainstones First as already noted their structural and stratigraphic context suggests a shallower setting as they occur where a thinning of the BVF is observed in association with a change in facies to grain- supported detrital rocks with rounded to well-rounded grains and cross-stratification Second instead of being interbedded with profundal lake deposits as would be expected in a deeper lake setting the grainstones form decameter-thick stacked packages lacking intercalations of such facies Where interbeds of other facies do occur they mainly comprise limited developments of the shrub spherulite and calcimudstone c ycles described in Figure 3 and Table 1 which become progressively better developed downdip Figure 12 All published work on the BVF to date suggest that the shrubs and spherulites represent relatively shallow closed lake deposits based on the following 1 The near absence of sand-size siliciclastic sediment reflecting riverine input 2 A low-diversity nonmarine ostracod fauna which becomes increasingly restricted up-section in the BVF Pietzsch et al 2018 3 Carbon and oxygen stable isotopes that either show covariant trends Wright and Barnett 2017 Barnett et al 2018 or in the absence of covariance limited variation in 13C but a wide range in 18O values Pietzsch et al 2020 Although the earlier criteria are strong evidence that the BVF lakes were hydrologically closed and therefore probably tending to be relatively shallow caution is needed in trying to assign precise water depths The covariant trends in carbon and oxygen and stable isotopes documented by Talbot 1990 for example come from modern closed lakes and although the fact of hydrologic closure is beyond doubt the maximum water depth of these lakes ranges from 3 m to greater than 400 m Nevertheless it is clear 172 BARNETT ET AL Figure 12 Schematic model for grainstone deposition on a tilted fault block showing the association with basinward lacustrine facies Model is shown at the scale of two meter-scale cycles see Figure 3 A Grainstone rudstone lithofacies are restricted to updip locations and the shrub lithofacies association progressively thins downdip so that the BVF in downdip settings is dominated by the spherulite and calcimudstone lithofacies associations B Inboard of A the shrub lithofacies association becomes thicker and more developed producing cycles like those described by Wright and Barnett 2015 C In progressively more updip locations cycles are locally capped by sharp-based thin beds of the grainstone rudstone facies association which represent the feather edge of the more extensive belt of detrital carbonates described in this chapter D On both the dip slope and escarpment slope of the fault block crest stacked decimeter-to-meter scale packages of grainstones occur with relatively thin intercalations of other BVF lithofacies that the grainstones do not pass downdip into typical profundal lake deposits e g thick successions of laminated calcimudstones as would be expected if they were generated by deep-water currents Consequently it may be based on the earlier discussion that the only widespread albeit indirect evidence of subaerial exposure in the BVF is the presence of grainstones of the type described here in as much as they may record the subaerial disaggregation of previously deposited BVF limestones Regardless the identification and mapping of shoreline deposits is critical to the interpretation of the BVF because it lacks many of the typical indicators of water depth that geoscientists are accustomed to working with This is especially important given the ongoing debate about the paleobathymetry of the BVF lake If the interpretation presented in this chapter is correct then the grainstones provide an important reference point for the understanding of the more commonly occurring BVF facies A schematic model illustrating the relationship between the grainstones and the other facies that make up the BVF is presented in Figure 12 CONCLUSIONS Much of the debate as to the origin of the unusual BVF carbonates has been fueled by the paucity of many of the sedimentological features that geoscientists normally use to interpret sedimentary rocks The presence of the thick and extensive belt of high-energy shallow-water deposits documented in this chapter therefore provides an essential datum or reference point to constrain the interpretation of the more commonly occurring and also more enigmatic facies that make up the BVF and equivalent stratigraphic units in neighboring basins Given the good reservoir quality of the grainstone facies and their preferential occurrence in seismically mappable tectono-stratigraphic settings they also represent a potential exploration target on other pre-salt structures To date lacustrine carbonate shoreline deposits have received relatively little study and as with so many other aspects of the pre-salt carbonates of the Santos Basin the deposits described here demonstrate the need both from an academic and economic point of view for further research

Critically Evaluating the Current Depositional Models for the Pre-Salt Barra Velha Formation Offshore Brazil V Paul Wright1 and Andrew Barnett2 Search and Discovery Article 51439 2017 Posted November 20 2017 Adapted from Keynote Address given at AAPG SEG International Conference and Exhibition London England October 15-18 2017 Datapages 2017 Serial rights given by author For all other rights contact author directly 1 PW Carbonate Geoscience Cardiff UK vpw pwcarbonategeoscience com Shell Canary Warf London UK 2 Abstract This presentation assesses approaches for evaluating the two contrasting models for the depositional settings for the Cretaceous Barra Velha Formation carbonate reservoirs of Santos Basin and their impact upon exploration strategies and reservoir modelling One model invokes deeper lakes with differentiated microbial platforms having relief of hundreds of metres as well as smaller buildups The other model is of very shallow evaporitic hyper-alkaline lakes with predominantly abiotic carbonate and Mg-silicate precipitates The case for the former has been based on the perceived presence of shelf-like margins resembling marine carbonate platforms whereas the latter is based on detailed sedimentological analysis from a large data set supported by geochemical modelling The hydrology of the Barra Velha lakes can be assessed by proxy using carbon and oxygen stable isotopes by comparison with extensive studies from Quaternary lake deposits from East Africa Co-variant trends in these Barra Velha isotopes suggest the former presence of shallow evaporitic lakes which were likely very extensive or sourced from a uniform aquifer Identifying isolated carbonate buildups is now facilitated by scoring using work flows but this approach relates to marine systems and may not be appropriate for nonmarine ones as the absence of modern or ancient large scale nonmarine buildups limits this approach Instead the evidence shows that the large platform-like features are largely post-Barra Velha and structural in origin affected by varying degrees of subaerial erosion denudation While available sedimentological and geochemical evidence does not support the presence of platform-like features with hundreds of metres of relief this does not preclude the presence of large carbonate mounds and ridges analogous to those seen in modern extensional systems However as such features can be sub-lacustrine subaerial or periodically both their presence and interpreted relief cannot be used to draw reliable conclusions about palaeobathymetry Facies and well logs allow correlations to be made in the Barra Velha Formation from what appear to have been lows lake floor to highs platform within the basin as defined beneath the base salt This implies that these apparent topographic differences of hundreds of metres or more were not being reflected in any lithological differences at the time of deposition This suggests that what appear to be paleotopographic differences are due to later structuration post-deposition of the lake sediments and prior to salt deposition

t Technical papers Multiattribute framework analysis for the identification of carbonate mounds in the Brazilian presalt zone Carlos Jesus1 Maria Olho Azul2 Wagner Moreira Lupinacci3 and Leandro Machado4 Abstract Carbonate mounds as described herein often present seismic characteristics such as low amplitude and a high density of faults and fractures which can easily be oversampled and blur other rock features in simple geobody extraction processes We have developed a workflow for combining geometric attributes and hybrid spectral decomposition HSD to efficiently identify good-quality reservoirs in carbonate mounds within the complex environment of the Brazilian presalt zone To better identify these reservoirs within the seismic volume of carbonate mounds we divide our methodology into four stages seismic data acquisition and processing overview preconditioning of seismic data using structural-oriented filtering and imaging enhancement calculation of seismic attributes and classification of seismic facies Although coherence and curvature attributes are often used to identify high-density fault and fracture zones representing one of the most important features of carbonate mounds HSD is necessary to discriminate low-amplitude carbonate mounds good reservoir quality from low-amplitude clay zones nonreservoir Finally we use a multiattribute facies classification to generate a geologically significant outcome and to guide a final geobody extraction that is calibrated by well data and that can be used as a spatial indicator of the distribution of good reservoir quality for static modeling Introduction Brazil has been producing oil from presalt carbonate reservoirs over the past decade Recently these reservoirs attained an incredible output of just more than 1 7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day representing more than half of the country s daily production and demonstrating the importance of these carbonate reservoirs to Brazil However it is tremendously challenging to map and characterize these carbonate reservoirs given their considerable spatial heterogeneity complex pore systems and often ambiguous seismic responses Burgess et al 2013 define criteria for discriminating different carbonate features in a seismic image that involve regional constraints analysis of basic seismic geometries and analyses of geophysical details and finer scale seismic geometries For the purpose of this work we adopted analyses of seismic geometries and geophysical details as well as amplitude anomalies and the behavior of frequencies in the reservoir interval together with the high density of faults and fractures to define carbonate features many of which were assessed at a subseismic scale Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Here we propose a workflow for identifying and characterizing carbonate mounds in the Brazilian presalt zone using a combination of hybrid spectral decomposition HSD together with geometric attributes and curvature and coherence attributes For this work we use the term carbonate mounds to describe almost conical carbonate bodies of pronounced relief that are often difficult to map seismically due to their ambiguous limits and internal low-amplitude reflectors but that exhibit excellent reservoir quality in terms of matrix and associated fracturing and that have been successfully drilled evaluated and tested It is beyond the scope of this work to interpret these features further or to establish their depositional environment For a broader perception of the many interpretations of these presalt carbonates we suggest amongst others the works of Wright and Barnett 2017 on Barra Velha Formation depositional systems Buckley et al 2015 on early Cretaceous lacustrine carbonate platforms Wright and Barnett 2017 on depositional models for the presalt Barra Velha Formation and Wright and Rodriguez 2018 on depositional interpretations of presalt environments and their links to seismic facies Our 1 Petrogal Brasil

seismic facies and their relationship to present-day reservoir quality which we believe can be applied and adjusted to different settings within the Brazilian presalt sequence Our intent is to detail a workflow that can facilitate mapping of present-day good reservoir quality carbonate mound geometries to enable their characterization from a seismic perspective and to allow assessment of their spatial distribution for the purposes of reservoir modeling during the exploration and appraisal stages Seismic attenuation can greatly affect the quality of seismic signals perpetuated at considerable depths Lupinacci and Oliveira 2015 Yuan et al 2017 Consequently mapping carbonate mounds in the Brazilian presalt fields which lie at depths ranging between 5000 and 6000 m and below an approximately 2000 m thick layer of salt is a major challenge for geoscientists because of low seismic illumination and low-amplitude anomalies low impedance and the high fault and fracture density that are characteristic of these geologic features It is difficult to identify and delineate such features in these presalt fields using only seismic data because of the complexity of the seismic image generated and the absence of impedance contrast between the reservoir and adjacent sealing facies Zheng et al 2007 Despite many criteria for presalt seismic data having already been defined we consider in this study that general information about the acquisition and processing of such data is essential to understanding its ambiguities and limitations Furthermore because seismic data can be contaminated by random and coherent noise arising from data acquisition or complex geology that can bias results even after data processing and migration Chopra and Marfurt 2007 data preconditioning is crucial to obtain good results Lupinacci et al 2017 With respect to carbonate reservoir characterization seismic facies analysis is increasingly seen as an effective way of estimating reservoir properties Matos et al 2007 combining different seismic attributes through pattern recognition algorithms such as seismic multiattributes analysis Rongchang et al 2017 to identify for example lateral changes in a reservoir Seismic attributes are important tools for reservoir characterization that can help to visually enhance or quantify features of interest Chopra and Marfurt 2007 However selection of seismic attributes for analysis should be made with caution so as not to propagate false interpretations Curvature and coherence attributes can be used together in seismic multiattribute analyses to increase the reliability of this type of geologic analysis The curvature attribute describes how bent a curve is at a point along its length Roberts 2001 focusing on changes in shape This attribute is a good predictor of faults as well as anticline and syncline structures Klein et al 2008 because it is not affected by variations in amplitude related to changes in lithology and fluid The coherence cube attribute a measure of the similarity between neighboring seismic traces in three dimensions has been used since 1995 Bahorich and Farmer 1995 as a powerful seismic interpretation tool for imaging geologic discontinuities such as faults and fractures which are recurrently associated with carbonate mound features in this study area However many ways of calculating coherence can be implemented Here we applied the eigenvalue-coherence algorithm Gersztenkorn and Marfurt 1999 Marfurt et al 1999 which uses several adjacent traces within a local window to estimate discontinuity for each sample Spectral decomposition is another widely used attribute for identifying seismic patterns It can represent the seismic trace in a frequency domain or in subbands of frequencies It can be used to identify subtle thickness variations and discontinuities as well as to predict bedding thicknesses e g Partyka et al 1999 Spectral decomposition can also be used to identify low-frequency shadow which may indicate the presence of hydrocarbons Sun et al 2002 Wang 2007 or as in this study to identify good quality reservoirs upon calibration by the well-log porosity response Additionally a frequency bandwidth related to seismic facies can be selected from a spectral decomposition analysis so a specific amplitude range can be isolated that represents a reservoir anomaly called HSD Jesus et al 2017 Pattern recognition and classification of seismic features is fundamental to seismic data interpretation Zhao et al 2015 so uniting different criteria through several seismic attributes and establishing seismic facies classes is an excellent approach for isolating reservoirs of good quality in presalt carbonate mounds from shale or tight zones nonreservoir We propose a workflow for identifying and characterizing carbonate mounds in the Brazilian presalt zone using a combination of HSD with curvature and coherence geometric attributes We chose those attributes because of their ability to provide useful geologic information and used them to generate a seismic facies classification to specifically identify good-quality reservoirs in carbonate mounds The extracted geobody was then used as a spatial indicator of the distribution of porosity in the reservoir Methodology As described in Burgess et al 2013 there is no clear set of diagnostic criteria for identifying many specific carbonate features especially in frontier regions From a geophysical perspective the Brazilian presalt zone is still a frontier area and given the influence of salt thickness on image quality of seismic data seismic acquisition and processing details need to be carefully understood prior to performing any proposed methodology for seismic data interpretation Our workflow starts with preconditioning of the seismic data Figure 1 using structural-oriented filtering SOF to remove some background noise and preserve fault edges The SOF volume is then used to generate T468 Interpretation May 2019 Downloaded from https pubs geoscienceworld org interpretation article-pdf 7 2 T467 4698394 int-2018-0004 1 pdf by Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul user the curvature attribute In parallel and to improve the overall vertical resolution an image enhancement is applied to the SOF volume to calculate a coherence cube which facilitates better identification of the faulted and fractured character of these presalt carbonate mounds We also apply HSD to the SOF volume to identify low-amplitude zones which correspond to areas of good porosity All of these seismic attributes are then combined to classify the seismic facies which allow us to distinguish the most important facies representing good reservoir quality carbonate mounds and to extract a geobody that can then be used as a spatial control for porosity distribution in reservoir modeling Our methodology for characterizing carbonate mounds is thus divided into four stages 1 seismic data acquisition and processing overview 2 preconditioning of seismic data 3 calculation of seismic attributes and 4 classification of seismic facies We describe these processing stages in detail in the following sections Seismic data acquisition and processing overview The seismic acquisition was performed in 2013 from a single vessel equipped with 12 streamers 8000 m in length and dual sources The seismic data were recorded with an azimuth direction of 123 a sampling rate of 2 ms and a nominal fold of 80 Seismic acquisition parameters are presented in Table 1 Depth imaging and velocity model building VMB in deepwater environments with complex and large evaporated layers is challenging for seismic illumination These seismic acquisition parameters are not ideal for seismic illumination of presalt reservoirs Had the seismic data been acquired as broadband we could have applied a more efficient seismic processing The initial VMB was rendered on legacy data to obtain a more realistic and geologically relevant outcome by first applying an isotropic model for the initial step and then deriving a tilted transversal isotropic model from the tomographic data along with the seismic inversion Bakulin et al 2010 To decrease the well-to-seismic mistie we updated the anisotropy models based on the well markers Another important strategy we adopted for the VMB was to divide the salt layer using intermediate horizons that separated stratified salt from homogeneous salt The background starting salt velocity for the tomography was 4500 m s and then we applied a weighted mask to guide the tomography and produce a stronger update in the stratified salt layer This strategy made it possible to establish a more precise velocity model for the presalt zone Preconditioning of seismic data According to H ecker and Fehmers 2002 three premises are required to apply filters successfully on poststack seismic data orientation analysis edge detection and smoothing with edge preservation Furthermore considering the criteria we adopted in this case study which include amplitude frequency anoma- lies geometry and fault and fracture density application of SOF should guarantee that the quality of the data improves without having to change the criteria To improve the quality of the seismic data contaminated with background noise we applied SOF and image enhancement Figure 2b and 2c to precondition the seismic data Qi et al 2014 Preconditioning should be concentrated in the region of interest The aim of SOF is to improve the lateral continuity of the seismic reflector and increase the signal-to-noise ratio The SOF algorithm applies volumetric dip and azimuth calculations to avoid smearing of faults fractures and other discontinuities using an overlapping window method Marfurt 2006 We used the SOF output to calculate an image enhancement through increasing the frequency bandwidth Bruce and Caldwell 2003 thereby bolstering weak frequencies to reduce the effect of attenuation Figure 2c This step could be considered a type of spectral enhancement the objective of which was to improve seismic resolution by increasing the frequency bandwidth This process does not create Seismic data Spectral decomposition Structure oriented filtering Hybrid spectral decompostion Image enhancement Curvature Coherence Figure 1 Steps used to calculate the seismic

of some frequencies existing within the seismic data to better define the reservoir architecture Calculation of seismic attributes The seismic attributes were calculated after SOF and image enhancement The curvature and spectral decomposition attributes were generated directly from SOF The coherence attribute was derived from the image-enhancement step The HSD was obtained from the spectral decomposition step The steps for calculating the seismic attributes are shown in Figure 1 The curvature attribute describes how a surface deviates from being planar Figure 3 Basically it measures subtle lateral and vertical changes in dip that are often dominated by strong localized deformation for example carbonate reefs on 20 dipping surfaces can present the same curvature anomaly as a carbonate reef on a flat surface Chopra and Marfurt 2007 In this case study several curvature attributes were tested including the most positive most negative and dip curvatures We found that dip curvatures which are acquired by extracting the curvature in the direction of maximum dip presented the best result Volume curvature attributes can enhance seismic resolution providing more in-

2007 According several tests it was possible to see that the difference between the curvature calculation results before and after image enhancement is that after image enhancement there is the risk of boost up some noise and this attribute is very sensitive to noise And coherence shows to be more effective after improvement of the resolution We used the coherence attribute to search along structural dips because it helps to reveal the true edges After we analyzed the dominant frequency and identified the frequency bandwidth that best represents the target we used HSD to decompose the seismic data into frequency bands This frequency bandwidth is selected to calculate the envelope attribute from which a specific amplitude range is isolated Jesus et al 2017 We obtained the HSD parameters after SOF application to maintain the proportionality of the amplitude and thereby preserve the reservoir anomalies To achieve an optiCrossline mized HSD for the area of interest two steps are required a sensitivity study stage 1 and an isolation study of frequency ranges and representative amplitudes stage 2 3 we identified the dominant frequency as being approximately 8 Hz Also as part of our sensitivity study and using the same interval we generated a root-meansquare rms amplitude map to identify low-amplitude zones which is a recurring characteristic of presalt carbonate mounds As illustrated in Figure 5b all wells except for well 4 are in low-amplitude zones Stage 2 After our sensitivity study had revealed the frequency best representing the interval of interest and we had identified the respective low-amplitude zones through stage 1 we could isolate the frequency and amplitude ranges by applying a short-time Fourier transform STFT with a Hanning window for

locations wells 1 3 and identifying the low-amplitude zones for the presalt carbonate mounds being investigated we could isolate the frequency and amplitude associated with the carbonate mounds by selecting a dominant frequency subband of 8 Hz and then calculating an envelope attribute for this subband To define the interval for the envelope that represents these presalt carbonate mounds it was necessary to also use the acoustic-impedance volume which assumes a low-impedance occurrence in the mound zones represented by wells 1 3 whereas well 4 was defined as nonreservoir As well 4 also presented a high value for the 8 Hz envelope we established a cutoff to effectively isolate the carbonate mounds by combining the 8 Hz dominant frequency with the acoustic-impedance volume representing a low impedance for the carbonate mounds Where the 8 Hz envelope and acoustic impedance presented low values the area was considered a carbonate mound but when only the envelope-attribute value was low the area was considered a nonreservoir Table 2 We applied a maximum cutoff value of 0 27 for the envelope attribute to discriminate between reservoirs and nonreservoirs Finally the following script was applied to the envelope attribute for 8 Hz as the dominant frequency spectral decomposition to generate the HSD HSD IF Envelope Value 540 THEN Envelope Envelope ELSE Envelope 541 Accordingly if the envelope value was less than or equal to 540 then the value was retained to represent reservoirs otherwise the standard value of 541 was assigned representing nonreservoirs The spectral decomposition and HSD for the top reservoir horizon are shown in Figure 7 A southeast to northwest trend of low amplitude passing through wells 2 and 3 can be seen in Figure 7a which can be associated with the carbonate mounds Figure 7b reveals that HSD was better than spectral decomposition in identifying the main low-amplitude trend corresponding to carbonate mounds wells 2 and 3 Figure 8 shows the main quality control of HSD where pseudolog data from HSD was extracted at each well location wells 1 4 and compared with the total porosity log rescaled to seismic output The quality control showed a good correlation between HSD pseudolog and total porosity so for low HSD values there is an inversely proportional high value for total porosity This outcome increases the confidence in our HSD Seismic facies classification Seismic facies can be defined as a group of seismic responses with characteristics that distinctly differ Table 2 Correlation between envelope and

round under a production sharing agreement to Petrobras operator Shell Total CNOOC CNPC and PPSA Geological and stratigraphic analysis based on public wells drilled in the Mero Field and high-quality 3-D seismic data mapping show wide variation in the facies distribution of microbial carbonate and coquina reservoirs Thickness variation in coquinas and shale intercalation can be observed in well correlation and are associated with paleo basement highs Igneous rocks are common in the reservoir Petrophysical evaluation indicates significant variations in fluid composition between Mero Field and Libra Complex Although the Mero Field is composed of good-quality oil 29 API the Libra Complex consists mainly of gas condensate with high carbon dioxide CO2 content demonstrating that these structures are disconnected Petrophysical data also indicate that Mero Field is characterized by two compartments with different oil water contacts OWCs It can be explained by semipermeable barriers probably because of internal variation in facies distribution This chapter aims to present a general overview of the geological and petrophysical characteristics of the Mero Field based on data that have just become public Copyright 2021 by The American Association of Petroleum Geologists DOI 10 1306 13722325MSB 13 1853 351 352 Petersohn et al INTRODUCTION The Mero Field is located in the central part of the Santos Basin southeastern Brazil about 180 km off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in a water depth of approximately 2 000 m Figure 1 It was discovered in 2010 by the well 2-ANP-2A-RJS drilled by Petrobras in partnership with the Brazilian National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels ANP In 2013 the Libra Block was offered in the first bid round executed by the Brazilian government under the new production sharing agreement for the pre-salt areas In this block a large four-way closure of more than 500 km2 trending northwest southeast was mapped The 2-ANP-2A well tested the northwest part of the structure and revealed a 327 m oil column in carbonate reservoirs displaying excellent porosity and permeability proprieties The consortium formed by Petrobras operator Shell Total CNOOC CNPC and PPSA won the bid The Libra Consortium is led by Petrobras with a 40 interest in partnership with Shell 20 Total 20 CNPC 10 and CNOOC Limited 10 Pr -Sal Petr leo PPSA represents the Brazilian federal government on production sharing agreements Figure 2 shows the four areas identified in the Libra Block that divided by significant fault zones northwest central southeast and south The northwest compartment became the Mero Field whose declaration of commerciality was announced by the consortium on November 30 2017 Carlotto et al 2017 First oil is expected by 2021 The other compartments of the Libra Block are still under evaluation The isolated part of the structural closure representing the Mero Field along the western margin of the Libra Complex is apparent on the base of salt structure map Figures 2 3 Figure 1 Campos and Santos basin location map with bathymetric curves and blocks and oil fields currently under concession The Giant Mero Oil Field Geological and Petrophysical Settings of One of the Largest Pre-Salt Fields of the Santos Basin Southern Brazil 353 Figure 2 Structural map of the Libra Complex at the top of the reservoir base of salt LIBRA BLOCK EXPLORATION HISTORY Wells 2-ANP-1-RJS and 2-ANP-2A-RJS which tested respectively the Franco and Libra prospects were drilled in 2009 and 2010 After discovery the Franco prospect was renamed as Buzios Field the largest oil field in Brazil and a part of Libra became the Mero Field The aforementioned wells were conceived by the ANP technical team at the time an Inter-ministerial Commission created by the Brazilian federal government was discussing a new regulatory framework for the pre-salt areas Three new laws were published Among them was the Law of Onerous Assignment and Petrobras Capitalization Law 12 276 10 which authorized the government to subscribe to Petrobras joint-stock shares and to pay for them with federal public debt securities Under this agreement was the assignment of exploration and production rights for Petrobras for the recovery of up to 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent BOE from the pre-salt interval To ensure Petrobras would obtain 5 billion BOE ANP realized it would be necessary to drill wells to identify large oil accumulations that could contain such a volume of oil Therefore ANP created a working group of geologists who mapped the pre-salt sequence of the Santos Basin to identify possible targets The group identified two prominent four-way closures that could contain the volume needed to be assigned and they recommended drilling two wells The ANP working group worked together with Petrobras because the state-owned oil company would be operationally responsible for the drilling of these wells Franco was the first prospect to be drilled followed by Libra The well results and the studies conducted by the ANP technical team indicated at the time that the Franco prospect Buzios Field would have 22 billion barrels of oil in place and therefore the assignment of only the Franco Block would be sufficient for the Petrobras capitalization process The technical evaluation of the ANP team was also corroborated by Gaffney Cline Associates GCA a 354 Petersohn et al Figure 3 Structural map of the Mero Field at the top of the reservoir base of salt global oil and gas consultant hired by the ANP to audit and evaluate 10 prospects in the pre-salt play of the Santos Basin that could be the subject of assignment to Petrobras According to the GCA report published in 2010 GCA 2010 the OOIP for the Franco discovery ranged from a low estimate of 14 64 billion bbl to a high estimate of 29 29 billion bbl with a best estimate of 21 31 billion bbl Currently considering all subsequent exploration efforts executed in the past 10 years OOIP for the Buzios Field is 30 billion bbl The OOIP for the Libra prospect estimated by GCA ranged from a low estimate of 16 32 billion bbl to a high estimate of 52 49 billion bbl with a best estimate of 31 49 billion bbl However because of the exploration risk of drilling of a single well the Brazilian federal government decided to grant Petrobras rights under six blocks located in the pre-salt area Franco Florim Nordeste de Tupi Sul de Tupi Sul de Guar and Entorno de Iara Franco became the Buzios Field Entorno de Iara was renamed the Berbigao Sururu and Atapu fields Florin became the Itapu Field Nordeste de Tupi converted to the Sepia Field Sul de Guar became the Sul of Sapinho Field and Sul de Tupi is the Sul of Lula Field Therefore it was not necessary to include the Libra Block in the onerous assignment agreement with Petrobras anymore Consequently the Libra Block could be included in the first bid round under production sharing contracts inaugurating the new regime in Brazil Well 2-ANP-2A-RJS was in the northwest flank 250 m below the apex of the structure At the time the Libra Block was partially covered by time-migrated 3-D seismic 0258SPEC BS 4 PSTM survey and fully The Giant Mero Oil Field Geological and Petrophysical Settings of One of the Largest Pre-Salt Fields of the Santos Basin Southern Brazil 355 covered by 2-D depth-migrated seismic R 0258 2D SPEC PSDM BMS survey Because 3-D seismic coverage was mandatory to propose the well location the well was placed in the northwest part of the structure which at the time represented the only area covered by such data Within this area a mound-type feature interpreted as carbonate buildup was selected as the target to be drilled The well drilled 333 50 m of Aptian reservoir rocks gross with 275 m of net pay The OWC was found at 5 702 m depth After the signing of the contract which took place on December 2 2013 a significant set of exploration activities were carried out in the Libra Block It has been covered by a high-quality 3-D seismic survey and currently there are 15 wells drilled in the block PRE-SALT PLAY AND PETROLEUM SYSTEMS The pre-salt petroleum system source rocks are the shales from Itapema Formation with accumulation in traps within the carbonate reservoirs from Barra Velha and Itapema formations Barremian Aptian capped by Ariri Formation evaporites Itapema Formation depositional environment is interpreted as fresh-to-brackish lacustrine environment during the B arremian Aptian age Sabato-Ceraldi and Green 2016 Geochemical analysis performed on oil samples from selected wells along the Santos Basin corroborates this depositional origin Pre-salt reservoirs are generally composed of carbonate rocks including coquinas and or microbialites Microbial carbonates occur both in the sag post-rift and upper rift synrift sections these carbonates may be interspersed with coquina deposits in the Itapema Formation Neobarremian to E oaptian Those coquinas are calcirudites that consist of shell fragments and are commonly dolomitized or s ilicified The seal for the pre-salt play is the extensive salt deposit from Ariri Formation The main migration pathways are the vertical faults from the rift phase METHODS The geological stratigraphic and petrophysical analysis of the Mero Field was performed using public exploration wells listed in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 4 Seismic mapping of the main regional markers was performed with high-quality 3-D seismic data from R0264 PULSAR survey The description of the chrono- and lithostratigraphic units follows the division proposed by Moreira et al 2007 Well Location 2-ANP-2A-RJS Mero Central 3-BRSA-1255-RJS Mero Central 3-BRSA-1267A-RJS Libra Central 3-BRSA-1305A-RJS Mero

Work MERO FIELD STRUCTURAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION The economic basement in the Mero Field is composed of igneous rocks as described in several wells that show magmatic rocks at the base of the sedimentary section These igneous rocks are basalts probably extruded in a subaqueous environment belonging to the Hauterivian K20 K34 sequences Lithostratigraphically they are grouped into the Camboriu Formation Seismic data identify high-amplitude reflectors with tabular geometries and high dip bounded by rift faults in rotated blocks It seems that the lower limit of this seismic facies is an unconformity which separates economic from acoustic basement The acoustic basement is characterized by opaque noncoherent reflectors It might represent the Neoproterozoic metavolcanic- sedimentary complex of the Ribeira Belt Moreira et al 2007 The Barremian K36 sequence overlays the economic basement informally described in the Santos Basin as a talc-stevensite bearing sequence and grouped in the Pi arras Formation In the Mero Field the K36 sequence was sampled only by well 3-BRSA-1339A-RJS where around 70 m of silt-predominant sedimentary rocks have been described interspersed with limestone lenses Seismic data analysis shows that these rocks occur locally directly over the acoustic basement These seismic facies are thin and difficult to track as can be seen on Figure 5 The Barremian Aptian K38 sequence unconformably overlies the Pi arras Formation K36 sequence In the Santos Basin the K38 sequence is informally west east solid line Figures 6 11 correlation panels Figure 4 Mero and the Libra field block location map displaying public exploration wells It also shows north south dotted line see Figures 5 10 and 356 Petersohn et al seismic facies characterized by laterally continuous flat-parallel reflectors low frequency and high negative amplitude Figure 5 Arbitrary seismic line through the Mero Field It is noticeable a prominent basement high and a carbonate platform in the central part which shows The Giant Mero Oil Field Geological and Petrophysical Settings of One of the Largest Pre-Salt Fields of the Santos Basin Southern Brazil 357 358 Petersohn et al described as a coquinas sequence and grouped into the Itapema Formation The base of this sequence is characterized by layers of shale as sampled by several wells These shales are represented by reflectors of high negative amplitude and extensive lateral continuity in seismic data allowing correlation along the central part of Mero Field Figures 6 7 The well 3- BRSA-1339A-RJS which was drilled in the western part of the Mero Field has identified a large amount of fine-grained sedimentary rocks interspersed with coquinas whose layers can reach thickness of up to 100 m In the central part of the Mero Field layers of coquina can reach thicknesses of up to 400 m in the well 2-ANP-2A-RJS where only a few of other interlayered rocks occur Coquina reservoirs exhibit chaotic-to- progradational seismic facies and mound geometries These mounds exhibit internal reflectors characterized by low amplitudes and minimal lateral continuity and are arranged as clinoforms showing a progradational pattern with directions ranging from northeast to northwest Figure 8 These clinoforms are cut by a positive horizontal reflector discordant with the local stratigraphy and coincident with the OWC identified in well 2-ANP-2A-RJS The positive discordant reflector was interpreted as a flat spot and it is possible to track it throughout most of central part This extraordinary coquina thickness was deposited in a wide platform probably in shallow-water environment developed over gently dipping northern and western flanks of a prominent basement high which occur in the central and eastern parts of the Mero Field Figure 9 The top of the coquina onlaps against the basement in seismic data Coquinas also occur in the eastern part of the Mero Field However they show some differences in relation to those described on the northern and western flanks The well 3-BRSA-1350-RJS was drilled in the eastern part of the Mero Field and it identified a thinner coquina layer In the basal section of this well silicified limestones interlayered with thin coquina prevail Also there are other carbonatic lithotypes s ilexite and undifferentiated igneous rocks The top of this unit is characterized by silicified carbonates interlayered with shales and igneous rocks absent of coquinas Conversely coquinas have not been identified in wells 3-BRSA1322-RJS and 3-BRSA-1345-RJS which were drilled respectively at the northern and southern parts of the Mero Field Figure 10 The top of the K38 sequence is characterized by an increase in gamma-ray readings as demonstrated by the wells 2-ANP-2A-RJS 3-BRSA-1255-RJS 3- B RSA-1342A-RJS and 3-BRSA-1343-RJS On top of that in well 2-ANP-2A-RJS there is also a drop in the resistivity sonic and density readings Figure 11 Overlying the K38 sequence occur the K44 K46 and K48 sequences of the Aptian Barra Velha Formation The last two sequences are difficult to distinguish and they will be treated together as a single K46 K48 sequence Grainstones composed of pelecypod shell fragments reworked from the underlying coquinas are described in the basal part of the K44 sequence The younger parts of this sequence as well as the K46 K48 sequence are composed mainly by the intercalation of centimetric to metric layers of spherulites stromatolites and laminites Terra et al 2010 Intercalation of grainstones composed of reworked fragments of spherulites and stromatolites is especially common in wells located on the distal western platform and is less common in other areas In wells drilled in the central eastern part of the Mero Field in addition to the lithotypes described earlier submetric intercalations of shales can be observed These carbonate high-frequency cyclothems exhibit complex stratigraphic framework and each in situ facies may be deposited in different phases of fluctuations in the paleolake level in response to changes in the energy level Sabato-Ceraldi and Green 2016 Saller et al 2016 as well to the paleolake geochemistry Wright and Barnett 2015 Farias et al 2019 Wright and Barnett 2020 In situ spherulites are common in the wells drilled at the apex of the Mero Field whereas on the western flank of the field they appear to occur only as reworked fragments or are not described at all in the wells located in distal positions In situ spherulites are uncommon in the southern and northern parts of the Mero Field In situ stromatolites including shrubs commonly subcentimeter are described in wells located in the distal western flank as well as in the northern part of the structure Laminites are characterized by compositional variation with intercalating submillimeter layers composed of nodules bioclasts and siliciclastic grains They are more common in the wells located in the western platform and in the basal section of the central platform wells but can also be observed in the southern and northern parts of the field It is interesting to note that these laminites are practically absent at the structural apex Seismic data analysis indicates variations in the occurrence of the K46 K48 sequence in the Mero Field In the central part of Mero Field the K46 K48 sequence ranges in thicknesses from 100 to 300 m It is characterized by continuous flat-parallel reflectors low frequency and high negative amplitude and is interpreted as a carbonate platform Figure 6 Arbitrary seismic line through the Mero Field and the Libra Block The Giant Mero Oil Field Geological and Petrophysical Settings of One of the Largest Pre-Salt Fields of the Santos

Field The K46 K48 sequence thickness can reach up to 400 m in the northern and southern parts Intense igneous intercalation of intrusive and volcanic rocks is described in this sequence especially in the basal part possibly related to the Libra Transfer Zone Zhao et al 2019 These igneous rocks are characterized by high-amplitude reflectors in seismic data A mound with chaotic internal reflections was identified overlying those seismic facies this mound is very similar to the one at the southern end of the field This mound was interpreted as a buildup as seen in Figure 12 As stated earlier intrusive igneous rocks occur in the Mero reservoir and are easily identified in seismic as high-amplitude reflectors The wells drilled in this region demonstrate that these rocks can reach thickness of up to 70 m at its apex The occurrence of at least four magmatic events in this area is recognized and multiphase pervasive hydrothermal alteration related to those events is observed in the Libra Block generally tightening the reservoir Ren et al 2019 Wells drilled in the Libra Block exhibit a similar stratigraphy compared to the Mero Field Well 3- BRSA-1310-RJS is located in a saddle between the Mero Field and the Libra Complex and identified only K44 K46 and K48 sequences interlayered with igneous rocks Carbonates are mostly recrystallized possibly because of thermal effects of adjacent igneous rocks and therefore are considered as nonreservoir Well 4-BRSA-1346-RJS was drilled on the flank of the easternmost structure of the Libra Complex It identified the same sequences with distal facies characteristic of deeper water such as mudstones and shales and fewer occurrences of igneous rocks Finally well 3- BRSA-1267A-RJS was drilled near the apex of Libra s central structure It identified the K44 K46 and K48 sequences with intense interleaving of igneous rocks especially in the basal part It also identified the K38 sequence composed of coquinas interspersed with mudstone beds and a predominance of igneous rocks The structure is sealed by the K50 sequence composed of evaporites from Aptian Ariri Formation The overlying salt layer currently reaches thicknesses ranging from hundreds of meters to over 1 km forming a very efficient seal Figure 9 Structural map of the Mero Field at the top of basement 362 Petersohn et al the K38 sequence does not occur In the wells on the western flank this sequence exhibits greater shale intercalation At the top of the structure there is intrusive rock Figure 10 Correlation panel of public exploration wells with approximate north

crossing well 3-BRSA-1345-RJS The chaotic seismic facies in blue are interpreted as carbonate buildup PETROPHYSICAL ANALYSIS To better understand well logs in the Mero Field identifying the fluid contacts was considered an important first step The primary indicator in this case was the pressure depth relationship observed from wireline formation tests Two separate linear gradients were observed in the data and the intercept between the fluid gradients of oil and water zones revealed the position of the free water level FWL Jahn et al 2008 This fluid contact was confirmed by inflection of the true resistivity profile of the formation Both sources of information provide clear reliable and good-quality data for the wells analyzed in the Mero Field and generally indicate a consistent depth for the contact in each well For this reason the depth of the FWL was considered identical with that of the OWC This is common in the case of permeable reservoirs with little capillary pressure close to the contact Morton-Thompson and Woods 1993 Jahn 366 Petersohn et al et al 2008 and agrees well with the permeability data of the analyzed wells The oil pressure gradient observed in all wells is indiscernible within measurement uncertainty and linear regression adjustments with typical inclination of 0 074 kgf cm m Two distinct OWCs were clearly identified indicating at least two separate hydrocarbon compartments Figure 13 A structurally higher OWC occurs toward north end of the field at 5 705 8 m SSTVD and a lower OWC occurs to the south at 5 766 m SSTVD OWCs in two wells cannot be observed because of the presence of igneous rocks at the base of the reservoir at a structural level to obscure measurement of the OWC Well 3-BRSA-1267A-RJS sampled gas condensate in the central sector of the Libra Complex with a CO2 concentration of 67 In addition to the difference in fluid composition compared to the Mero Field the pressure gradient of the gas zone of 3-BRSA-1267ARJS does not intersect at any point with the Mero oil gradient This indicates that the Mero Field and Libra are separated It was not possible to identify the OWC position in the central sector of Libra because of the lack of data in the appraisal well caused by igneous intrusions at the base of the reservoir Because the OWC position was identified in each well gross pay of all wells was calculated with a mean and standard deviation of 380 5 84 5 m In the net pay estimation measurement of effective porosity by nuclear magnetic resonance NMR was used excluding well 3-BRSA-1305A-RJS which did not have this log In this well porosity was calculated by density profile Asquith and Krygowski 2006 The cutoff factor of 6 for porosity was estimated by the correlation between porosity and permeability given a m inimum permeability of approximately 3 mD Figure 14 Permeability was obtained from the NMR logs using the Timur-Coates relationship Coates et al 2001 a llowing average permeability per well to be calculated The water saturation was estimated using Archie s equation Archie 1942 with the true resistivity of the formation from the well logs and porosity from NMR logs The saturation exponent was assumed as 2 0 Asquith and Krygowski 2006 As is typical for carbonates Carothers 1968 the tortuosity factor was assumed as 0 85 and the cementation exponent as 2 14 From fluid samples of 2-ANP-2A-RJS at 5 553 5 5 613 5 and 5 624 3 m MD the formation water equivalent salinity was measured at 253 514 ppm This gives a formation water resistivity of approximately 0 015 ohm m at a formation temperature of 92 C Schlumberger 2009 This information was corroborated by a linear least squares regression on log log domain of true resistivity versus porosity at the water zone of 2-ANP-2A-RJS Figure 15 Solving this linear model with the tortuosity factor and cementation exponent given earlier gives a formation water Figure 13 The gas zone gradient for the central part of Libra left and the oil and water zone gradient for the lower and upper OWC identified in the two compartments of the Mero Field right The gas gradient of central Libra is compared to the identical oil zone gradient for the two compartments showing that this structure is separated from Mero Field The Giant Mero Oil Field Geological and Petrophysical Settings of One of the Largest Pre-Salt Fields

approximately 3 mD The black line shows the linear squares regression for the data set Figure 15 Pickett plot Pickett 1973 with a linear least squares regression of deep resistivity and porosity data for the water zone of 2-ANP-2A-RJS 368 Petersohn et al Figure 16 Histogram and kernel density estimation of net pay and gross pay distribution and net-to-gross distribution from Mero Field public wells The lower boxplot illustrates the main properties of each distribution with red diamonds at the distribution mean resistivity of 0 0143 ohm m which is compatible with the fluid sample analysis The cutoff factor applied for water saturation was 50 because this separates an accumulation carrying hydrocarbons from a mostly water-saturated reservoir The net pay of all public wells was calculated with a mean and standard deviation of 231 2 83 4 m Consequently a net-to-gross with a mean and standard deviation of 56 7 21 0 was obtained As illustrated in Figure 16 although most wells have a net to gross greater than 60 there are three wells with much lower values reaching almost 20 in the worst case This difference represents a variation of facies throughout the field To better illustrate the porosity water saturation relationships a more detailed analysis of the variation in the data was performed As illustrated in Figure 17 porosity distribution of the oil-saturated zone in each well is approximately lognormal In addition these distributions are compatible between wells The composition of all porosity measurements is approximately lognormal and the mean and standard deviation observed are 10 97 3 61 The same analysis was performed for water saturation Figure 18 Water saturation demonstrates a clear lognormality especially for aggregate distribution the mean and standard deviation are 7 22 6 97 These results agree well with literature on the prevalence of lognormal distributions for oil-related parameters Finally an example of a typical petrophysical analysis is illustrated for well 3-BRSA-1345-RJS Figure 19 This example shows the excellent quality of lower OWC determination by static pressure and resistivity data as well as illustrating the cutoffs and behavior typical of porosity resistivity and estimated water saturation logs Table 2 shows the summary of petrophysical properties for the public wells of the Mero Field Fluid properties extracted from well tests performed in wells were included CONCLUSIONS The facies variation identified in the Mero Field is reflected in the petrophysical properties described Although the Libra Complex represents a large fourway closure there are significant variations in the composition of fluids present in the wells of Mero and that observed in the Libra Block Well orosity distributions of each

saturation below the cutoff factor of 50 of the oil-saturated reservoir zone of the Mero Field 370 content This demonstrates that these structures are indeed distinct The Mero Field is individually compartmentalized into at least two parts According to the petrophysical analysis the gradient of the oil zone is the same for both compartments and the two identified contacts are flat These factors can be explained by the presence of semipermeable barriers compartmentalizing a reservoir that would otherwise be more homogeneous effective porosity free fluid adimensional intervals considered as

represents the largest pre-salt exploration and production area in Brazil Currently it accounts for more than 70 of the country s oil and gas production ANP 2021 In this context the Buzios Field is considered a super-giant field with an estimated volume in place of 3 058 million barrels of oil equivalent In January 2021 the outstanding result of 146 524 Bbl d was achieved by the platform with the highest oil production in the country In this Basin the main reservoirs are the inner coquinas a type of sedimentary rock composed mainly by shells and their fragments of the Itapema Formation and the spherulitic laminated deposits shrubs and reworked facies of the Barra Velha Formation Gomes et al 2020 The carbonate sedimentation processes are extremely sensitive to climatic factors hydrodynamics basin tectonics and morphology These differences might cause vertical and lateral heterogeneity effects in seismic facies Porta 2015 Castro 2019 showed that the Itapema Formation in the Buzios Field is less influenced by the presence of fine grain sediments and has better permeabilities than the Barra Velha Formation Both formations are important presalt exploration targets and have quite different sedimentary-tectonic contexts The objective of this work is to understand the evolution of the rift and sag phases in the Buzios Field area from seismic data analysis Furthermore this paper intends to collaborate for a better understanding of the paleoenvironments and tectonic settings of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations Barremian-Aptian succession of the Santos Basin Geological Setting The Santos Basin is located in the southeastern Brazilian margin bounded by the Campos Basin at the North and the Pelotas Basin at the South Santos Basin is one of the most extensive offshore Brazilian basins with an area of 352 000 km and a current water depth of up to Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 3 000 m The main structural features are the Cabo Frio High to the Northeast and the Florian polis Platform to the Southwest the Santos hinge line to the West which marks the external western limit of the salt Ariri Formation and the S o Paulo plateau to the East Moreira et al 2007 The Buzios Field is located in the Santos Basin Fig 1 According to Moreira et al 2007 the geological history of the Santos Basin can be divided into three phases Rift Post-rift and Drift The Rift phase displays extension efforts of separation between the South American and African plates which started from the Lower Cretaceous Muniz and Bosence 2015 describe that the sequence of tectonic events that caused the fragmentation of Gondwana would have started from the stretching and thinning process of the continental crust triggering a rifting process This fragmentation consisted of a mixed process controlled by lithospheric stretching and thermal anomalies The breakup of Gondwana occurred over a complex and heterogeneous basement composed of Paleoproterozoic Archaean age cratonic blocks and Neoproterozoic orogenic rocks Heilbron et al 2008 in addition to presenting a Paleozoic sedimentary coating covered by Eocretaceous volcanic rocks As stated by Moreira et al 2007 the crystalline basement of the Santos Basin generated in the context of Gondwana s amalgamation is characterized by granites and gneisses from Precambrian age of the Coastal Complex and metasediments of the Ribeira Belt Moreira et al 2007 During the main rifting process around 145 Ma the northwestern portion remained closed while a wedge was extended to the South along the east of South America Szatmari and Milani 2016 According to the authors volcanism would have been absent where the lithosphere was thick An important consequence during the rift phase was the space-forming mechanism for sedimentary accommodation in an extensional tectonic setting and widespread normal fault generation due to the mechanical subsidence process causing reactivation of faults in the Precambrian basement Mohriak et al 2008 MACEDO ET AL 437 Figure 1 - Location map of the Buzios Field Strugale et al 2021 point out that the different basement compositions represent another determining factor for the way the rifting process takes place Where the basement is heterogeneous the pre-existing fabric was reactivated whenever its orientation was favorable producing faults as the extension direction rotates whereas low to very low angle basement fabric were cross-cut by rift faults Where the basement was homogeneous and more stable only the previous formed faults remained active throughout the rifting Another effect observed was the contribution and influence of thermal anomalies in the region of the Santos Basin which would have been responsible for inducing the strain softening process since the beginning of the rift leading to the development of uplifted areas ANP LEBAC 2003 The importance of understanding the different processes related to the rifting phase relies on comprehending its influence during the deposition of the overlying sedimentary layers The rift super-sequence is composed of continental siliciclastic talc-stevensite ooids with interbedded lacustrine coquinas and organic-rich shales of the Pi arras and Itapema formations consisting of essentially continental sediments Szatmari and Milani 2016 As opposed to what was proposed by Moreira et al 2007 Wright Barnett 2015 state that the lower part of the Barra Velha Formation belongs to the rift phase During the rift phase the sediments from the bottom of the Barra Velha Formation were deposited These deposits show a prominent wedge geometry which may represent differences in the fault movement rate that consequently created space for accommodation Buckley et al 2015 Thus they state that this may represent an increase in the sedimentation rate at the base of the Barra Velha Formation when compared to the Pi arras and Itapema formations The post-rift sequence also known as the sag phase is represented by the Upper Barra Velha Formation which is characterized by shrubs spherulite laminated deposits and reworked facies Gomes et al 2020 precipitated in non-marine carbonate successions Wright Barnett 2015 The absence of unambiguous palaeoecologically significant fossils together with the presence of the mineral stevensite rather than marine-derived evaporates sulphates and chlorides indicates an alkaline lacustrine setting with a volcanic source area Wright Barnett 2015 In short the pre-salt reservoir rocks are mainly in the Itapema and Barra Velha formations Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 438 APPLICATION OF SEISMIC ARCHITECTURE INTERPRETATION IN PRE-SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS The Itapema Formation is represented by grainstones to bivalves coquinas wackestones and bioclastic packstones carbonate shales and dark shales rich in organic matter which sometimes also work as source rocks The Barra Velha Formation is composed of carbonates deposited in a lacustrine environment with a multiplicity of facies from boundstones and grainstones to mudstones The Itapema Formation is limited at the bottom by the Jiqui Buracica unconformity 126 4 M y and at the top by the Pr -Alagoas unconformity while the Barra Velha Formation is limited at the bottom by the Pr -Alagoas unconformity and at the top by the Base of Salt Moreira et al 2007 METHODOLOGY The seismic data provide information about the regional context depositional systems tectonic history and allow inferring geological features and heterogeneities favoring better understanding of sedimentary basins The interpretation of seismic reflection terminations onlap downlap toplap and erosive truncations is the main criteria for the recognition of stratigraphic units They are essential to better understand the resulting processes allowing foreseeing the current geological behavior Mitchum et al 1977 We performed the identification of seismic parameters to recognize information about the depositional environment source of sediments and the geological context in which the seismic facies were deposited In carbonate rocks due to the high heterogeneity of these rocks the integration of well and seismic data is essential for the reservoir characterization The steps used to develop this work are summarized in Figure 2 The seismic data used consist of a PSDM volume prestacked depth migration on which we apply a structural smoothing filter to remove part of migration smile noises The parameterization was a median filter with a vertical window 5mx5m not to lose the vertical Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 resolution and a lateral window of 7 5m x 7 5 x y Then we interpreted four important unconformities in the pre-salt zone i Economic basement ii Jiqui -Buracica unconformity Pi arras and Itapema Formations iii Pr -Alagoas unconformity top of coquina deposits and the boundary between Itapema and Lower Barra Velha Formations iv Intra-Alagoas unconformity which separates the Lower Barra Velha from Upper Barra Velha and v the Base of the Salt Data from 15 wells Fig 3 helped in the seismic interpretation based on the identification of the boundaries between the lithostratigraphic units We selected well 9-BUZ-4-RJS through section BB to represent the identification of the main unconformities and formation boundaries and for analysis of depositional environment Fig 3 Previous works were also fundamental for a better understanding of the sedimentarytectonic history of the study area Castro 2019 Ferreira et al 2021a 2021b The seismic attribute TecVA Bulh es and Amorim 2005 was applied to highlight reflection events which is calculated from the absolute amplitude or RMS Fig 4 After calculating the absolute value of the trace RMS amplitude and its estimation of the seismic trace envelope the debias filter is applied and finally a phase rotation at -90 Hilbert transform RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The pre-salt succession of the Santos Basin was described in this work based mainly on the i identification of seismic reflection terminations and the ii interpretation of regional unconformities and faults Figs 5 6 7 and 8 We recognize in Figure 5 the erosional truncations as reflectors that end on the base of the salt as a result of possible erosion especially in the region at the east of the F1 fault which caused a strong tilt in the strata We also visualized the amount of onlap markings present mainly in the region of a build-up to the East Fig 6 It is noted that the MACEDO ET AL 439 Figure 2 - Location map of the Buzios Field Figure 3 - Location map of the Buzios Field Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 440 APPLICATION OF SEISMIC ARCHITECTURE INTERPRETATION IN PRE-SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS Figure 4 - Section AA Original Seismic A and TecVA attribute B with Economic basement red and main faults black highlighted Figure 5 - Section AA Schematic stratigraphic sequences and angular relationships defining the boundaries of the stratigraphic units Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 MACEDO ET AL 441 horizontal strata ends against an inclined surface being in this case a possible build-up Figs 5 and 6 This onlap configuration is very present in places with faults F2-F3 in Fig 6 that were generated during the rifting process which has influence on the formation of accommodation space and generation of wedges in the synrift interval Fig 5 It is worth mentioning the possibility of apparent onlaps terminations that previously presented downlap characteristics but which underwent a change in geometry due to tectonic activity in half-graben systems causing a new disposition of the lateral layers as a consequence Hart 2000 The Economic Basement was interpreted as a high amplitude reflector due to the high impedance contrast of the basalts with the siliciclastic deposits of the Pi arras Formation The TecVA attribute helped during the interpretation of this surface unconformity This attribute allowed improving the characterization of the seismic facies below the basement which is characterized as chaotic of low amplitude In addition TecVa also highlighted the faults of the pre-salt section Fig 4B The typical pattern of the basement is the absence of internal reflections or the presence of chaotic reflections The pre-salt interval in the Buzios Field has horst-graben systems characteristic of extensional basins Figs 5 6 7 and 8 The faults are very consistent along the entire rift pre-salt rift succession These two aspects have influence on geological sedimentation and the faults might act as fluid conductors Moreira et al 2007 Szatmari Milani 2016 throughout the studied sections In these seismic sections the fault s orientation is N-S and can reach up to 2 km of displacement In the syn-rift segment below Intra-Alagoas unconformity we observed medium to low amplitude reflectors with subparallel and wavy configurations of medium continuity and low frequency representing deposits of clastic sediments of the Pi arras Formation The next unconformity interpreted was Jiqui -Buracica that delimits the lower Itapema Formation The probable coquinas were interpreted as lacustrine deposits located at structural highs deposited under shallow and high-energy conditions Figs 6 and 7 Chinelatto et al 2020 The Itapema Formation presented progradational to chaotic seismic facies during the seismic interpretation Debris flows were also identified according to seismic reflection terminations added to the amplitude information a possible result of the fragmented configuration due to the rifting process In the Pre-Alagoas unconformity interpretation we observed higher amplitudes within plane-parallel seismic facies The Barra Velha Formation is also subdivided into upper and lower Barra Velha where the lower one is affected by a characteristic rifting tectonic regime and is described by reworked facies with rudstones and grainstones being the prevailing facies Arienti et al 2018 The upper one beneath the salt shows a predominance of flat arrangement in situ facies portraying a sag phase tectonic quiescence Wright Barnett 2015 Neves et al 2019 Silva 2021 Because of this aspect the layers are conformable We recognized the transition between lake bottom patterns of the upper rift phase passing upward to aggradational progradational carbonate platform during the sag phase indicating distal facies at the base of the sequence which can be attributed to the fault development in the region during the Barra Velha Formation deposition This fact helps to corroborate that the tectonic quiescence expected for the sag phase is not that much of a truth indicating that the upper section of the Barra Velha could be subdivided into upper rift and sag phases which was proposed by Wright Barnett 2015 Neves et al 2019 and Silva 2021 It is visualized in Figure 6 that the coquina bank is limited by two normal faults F1 and F2 sectioning the coquina bank in the central part of a structural high Figure 7 displays a structural high controlled by faults F1 and F3 and represents a preferential zone of coquinas formation observed in well 9-BUZ-4-RJS As can be seen between faults F2 and F3 Fig 6 Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 442 APPLICATION OF SEISMIC ARCHITECTURE INTERPRETATION IN PRE-SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS Figure 6 - Seismic section AA with unconformities and faults interpretation F1 F2 F3 represent important faults F1-F2 develop the compartmentalization of the inferred coquina bank F1 and F3 show its extension to the base of the salt It is also possible to recognize a build-up in the East dashed red circle and a Horst-Graben configuration Figure 7 - Seismic section BB with unconformity and fault interpretation The black vertical line shows well 9-BUZ-4-RJS which provided information during the interpretation of the main unconformities The yellow arrows indicate a thickness increase of the Itapema interval due to the tectonics Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 MACEDO ET AL 443 Figure 8 - Architectural analysis of the seismic section CC highlighting the depositional system distribution and tectonic settings of the Barra Velha and Itapema formations the thickness of the Barra Velha Formation was increased We point out this effect as an accommodation space creation The Sag phase is assigned as a period of tectonic quiescence However we can notice faults that reach the Base of the Salt Figs 6 and 7 leading to the discussion about the presence of some tectonic activity in this period Architectural differences between Barra Velha and Itapema formations especially related to the thickness and strata geometry can be observed in the Buzios Field Fig 8 The Itapema Formation exhibits fragmented asymmetric sections bounded by faults internally presenting apparent onlap reflectors All studied sections present this geometry and can be interpreted as half-graben structures formed during the rift phase Figs 6 7 and 8 It is noted that the rifting configuration as horsts and grabens is mandatory for space creation in the structural lows and displays a huge space for sedimentation In the central region of section CC there is a structural high that controls the nearest sedimentation and allows the creation of a carbonate platform in a shallow zone F3 marks another break caused by tectonics which changes the sedimentation of the Itapema Formation to a bottom lake sedimentation Comparatively Barra Velha Formation also displays facies controlled by tectonics with F1 reaching the base of the salt The sedimentation shows pathways modified due to tectonics but the layers are more continuous than the ones in Itapema Formation The space creation was more homogeneous than the one described in the Itapema succession The Barra Velha platform was bounded by main faults and the development of build-ups Fig 8 The platform slope exhibits low inclination angles and the bottom lake areas are quite widespread The shallow platform allowed a greater deposition of carbonate sediments It is important to highlight that fault F1 reaches the base of the salt which leads us to a discussion about the possibility of tectonics during the sag phase at upper Barra Velha Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 444 APPLICATION OF SEISMIC ARCHITECTURE INTERPRETATION IN PRE-SALT CARBONATE RESERVOIRS We identified the following seismic patterns during interpretation 1 Carbonate build-ups probably controlled by hydrothermal activity at the edge of faults 2 Carbonate platform sedimentation controlled by topography and bathymetry presenting aggradational or progradational character 3 Extensive carbonate platforms with planeparallel architecture present in the structural highs 4 Debris flow to the right of F3 Fig 6 correlated to the tectonics The carbonate mounds are often recognized presenting an internal low-amplitude reflector behavior with great possibility to be an excellent reservoir Jesus et al 2019 Ferreira et al 2019 2021a The build-ups display aggradational geometries that are onlapped and overlain by evaporates Figs 5 and 6 Above the Barra Velha Formation during the Neoaptian the evaporites of the Ariri Formation were deposited The base of the salt has a high amplitude characteristic and acts as the hydrocarbon seal at the region An isopach map provides information on a geological horizon and when combined with other geological information it can help the geologist interpret the tectonic activity and the history of this layer and its time segment The isopach map focuses on a special horizon and allows thickness analysis Based on the isopach maps Fig 9 we analyzed the thickness of each reservoir interval Itapema and Barra Velha strata to better understand their deposition phases over time which is characterized as an important step for future modeling To the Southeast we see a thickness increase of the Barra Velha Formation Fig 9A with probable mounds At this location the creation of accommodation space was very high Figure 9B displays a thickness increase at the central part of Itapema Formation at the same place where we observed a probable coquina bank restricted to the structural highs Braz J Geophys 39 3 2021 between the main faults This configuration shows that the basic architecture and distribution of the shallow platforms and bottom lake areas remained similar with some differences during the deposition of these two lithostratigraphic units However the zones of high and low accommodation space vary with the tectonic context Fig 8 i heterogeneous in the Itapema Formation due to development of half-graben structures and ii very homogeneous in the Barra Velha Formation due to the dominance of sag basin dynamics high accommodation regions controlled by rifting processes can be identified related to the lower Barra Velha sedimentation Szatmari and Milani 2016 also point out that there is an increase in the occurrence of oil reserves at the south of the Santos Basin According to the authors there is an increase of thickness to the South with the widening and deepening of the rift This pattern was also observed for the study area CONCLUSIONS Evidence of faults affecting the upper rift and sag sections in the location of the studied seismic sections indicates that the tectonic activity is at least locally controlling the sag phase sedimentation in some segments of the Buzios Field We identified seismic patterns as carbonate build-ups probably controlled by hydrothermal activity at the edge of faults and carbonate platform sedimentation controlled by topography and bathymetry presenting aggradational or progradational character with plane-parallel architecture in the structural highs Debris flows are correlated to the tectonics and there are platform slopes close to the main faults indicating the horst-graben system The coquinas found towards the top of the Itapema Formation are associated with structural highs influenced by faults acting as depositional controllers The thickness of the Barra Velha Formation increases along the section due to the geological behavior and tectonic activity The thickness and geological structure of the Itapema Formation are more affected by the MACEDO ET AL 445 Figure 9 - Isopachs showing the thickness variation of Barra Velha A and Itapema B formations AA BB and CC are the seismic sections and the X point in the Barra Velha isopach map A displays a thickness increase with a possibility of carbonate mounds The red circle in B displays the interpreted coquina bank in the Itapema Formation faults than they are in Barra Velha Formation which displays more plan-parallel facies We observe an improvement of thickness of both formations from the North to the South as can be seen at the isopach maps and comparing sections AA and CC It might indicate more favorable environmental conditions for the development of carbonate facies due to development of shallow zones

13 September 2017 Available online 18 September 2017 Stratigraphic-sedimentological forward modeling is a useful technique to test the role of parameters that may act in the depositional processes of sedimentary rocks The technique was applied to the Santos basin Brazil using the software program DIONISOS to test possible depositional scenarios for an Aptian section of a lacustrine carbonate platform developed during the late sag stage uppermost pre-salt section of the basin Different parameters were tested in a set of numerical simulations with the aim of reproducing the carbonate facies spatial distribution and the overall stratigraphic stacking pattern of the platform as observed in the available well data Several models were simulated and four of them are discussed in this paper Based on the available descriptive data from 10 wells Model 3 is considered to produce the best t to explain the development of the 100-m thick Aptian carbonate platform occurrences of grainstones and stromatolites as proximal and intermediate facies respectively and the overall carbonate stacking pattern Thus based on 3D stratigraphic-sedimentological forward modeling the best set of environmental conditions able to explain the pattern of carbonate deposition observed in the study area are 1 a slow carbonate depositional rate 0 08 mm y over an interval of 2 4 My which is indicative of a larger microbial contribution and 2 lake-level oscillations which were essentially induced by arid climatic conditions These results also enable new perspectives for the application of stratigraphicsedimentological forward modeling as a predictive tool for hydrocarbon exploration in carbonates and for the development of depositional models of other sag carbonate platform settings

different bathymetric intervals for carbonate deposition This study aims at the determination of a facies model to reproduce the sedimentary stacking pattern observed in well data and nally to propose a useful conceptual geological model for the deposition of the studied carbonate platform 2 Geological setting The Aptian carbonate platform focused on in this study is located in the central portion of the Santos basin approximately 310 km off the coast of the S ao Paulo state Fig 1 The origin and evolution of the basin are related to the breakup of the Gondwana Supercontinent but the Santos basin consists of a speci c area that forms a kinematic buffer between the Austral and Central segments of the South Atlantic Ocean Moulin et al 2010 2012 Breakup initiated during the Early Cretaceous and culminated with the opening of the South Atlantic Ocean and implantation of the Brazilian marginal basins in the so called Brazilian Rift System Chang et al 1992 In a regional context of rift development from south to north along the southeastern and eastern continental margins the 677 Santos basin progressed from small grabens and lakes to a regional subsidence setting that created extensive sag-phase lacustrine deposits Carminatti et al 2008 Quirk et al 2013 Thermal subsidence was then implemented by setting up a restricted environment with extensive deposition of evaporites during the Aptian At the beginning of the Albian a shallow carbonate platform was generated with the progression of the South Atlantic opening From the Middle Albian onwards the shallow carbonate platform was progressively drowned leading to the development of an open ocean setting in a passive margin tectonic environment Mio 2005 The stratigraphic sequence of the studied carbonate platform was deposited during the Neoaptian sag phase of the basin Fig 2 The depositional environment of this sequence was marked by a transitional setting between continental to shallow marine conditions Its upper limit is the base of the 113 My evaporites that mark the passage from a mixed clastic-carbonate sedimentary sequence to an evaporitic environment Moreira et al 2007 There are no published and available models regarding the morphological con guration of the sag lacustrine environments of the studied carbonate platform However Szatmari and Milani 2016 proposed a con guration model for the lakes of the South Atlantic rift province that may be appropriate to the studied carbonate platform which developed during the sag phase of the Santos basin According to that model structural highs horsts would separate two distinct lakes which would eventually communicate as a result of the rising of lake levels due to combinations of low evaporation and high precipitation rates and become isolated again with the decrease in lake levels due to Fig 1 Location map of the study area The dashed gray polygon marks the limit of the pre-salt eld s occurrence in the Santos and Campos basins The

Tectono-stratigraphy Fault hierarchy Rifted margins Syn-rift sequence hierarchy Sequence stratigraphy This paper uses high-resolution 2D and 3D seismic surveys tied to stratigraphic data from 155 boreholes in the mapping and hierarchization of 1551 extensional faults across the Santos Basin and its Outer High These faults were able to control deposition in extensional basins with different ages they are thus classified into three 3 main systems with the aim of understanding their geodynamic significance Fault system 1 FS1 controlled the oldest syn-rift sequence and delimits the very first half-graben basins developed during an Early Rift stage Fault System 2 FS2 was formed in response to crustal thinning during an Intermediate rifting stage Fault System 3 FS3 responded to the migration of the rift axis towards the distal margin in a Late Rift stage Strikingly fault reactivation occurred throughout the entirety of the proximal domain of the Santos Basin during the Late Rift Stage This work is important as each interpreted fault system is understood to have controlled the availability of accommodation space during its peak activity thereby shaping the inner proximal outer proximal and distal domains of the Santos Basin The evolution of these fault systems also resulted in the deposition of syn-rift se quences that obey a specific order or ranking By correlating fault systems with their adjacent syn-rift strata we propose 1st-order sequence boundaries that are associated with each stage of the development of the Santos Basin formed as a consequence of changes in thermo-mechanical conditions during the evolution of rifted margins Identified 2nd-order sequences are attributed to tectonic movements at the crustal-block scale In contrast stratigraphic sequences of the 3rd- and 4th-orders are associated with localised tectonic inputs Within this framework we use stratigraphic surfaces as structural markers across multiple observational scales Consequently sequence 1SEQ1 corresponds to the stretching phase standing for the initial stages of rifting within an intraplate setting Sequence 1SEQ2 relates to the necking stage and formation of the outer proximal domain whereas sequence 1SEQ3 accompanied the development of the distal domain in the so-called hyper extension and continental-breakup stages Ultimately this work demonstrates that the

evolution of syn-rift ba sins is key to understanding how continental margins are formed and progress towards their continental-breakup stage Lovecchio et al 2024 Yet gaps in the stratigraphic record are still common in sedi mentary basins that record multiphase extensional episodes such as SE Brazil s This is due to the combined effects of vertical tectonic move ments interactions amongst local-scale structures such as fault linkage points and step-overs and geodynamic processes acting on the larger continental-margin scale Gresseth et al 2023 Osmundsen and Pe ron-Pinvidic 2018 Redfield and Osmundsen 2013 Moreover syn-rift tectonics can persist after continental breakup is achieved including in deep-offshore basins of SE Brazil where it supposedly led to the reactivation of pre-existent extensional structures at different times and with varying magnitudes Alves et al 2023 Lei et al 2019 Soares et al 2012 All these aspects stress the fact that a continental margin s architecture impacts its reservoir successions and consequently the compartmentalization and fluid migration in these same reservoirs regardless if one is considering oil and gas extraction carbon storage or geoenergy solutions Brackenridge et al 2023 Fisher et al 2023 Jackson et al 2024 Konstantinovskaya et al 2023 Siler 2023 Ven tisky and Gilfillan 2023 A vast suite of seismic and borehole

rifted continental margins as it was the locus of new 3D seismic and drilling campaigns in the 2020s Through the detailed analysis of a comprehensive seismic and borehole dataset this works addresses the following research questions 2 1 Seismic and borehole data The seismic data in this work comprise a suite of 3D volumes and regional 2D profiles Figs 1 and 2 Three-dimensional 3D volumes include the depth-converted 0262-Alto Cabo Frio 0302-Tambau-Uru gua-Tambuata R0264-Santos-6a-libra R0282-Santos Cluster and R0302-Franco Fig 2b These seismic data are complemented by stratigraphic and wireline data from 155 exploration and production wells some of which are shown in Fig 2c A total of nine 9 seismic horizons and 1551 faults are interpreted in the study area Regional ION-GXT seismic profiles 2D are used to fit the more local interpretation of 3D seismic data into a broader margin-wide scale of observation The ION-GXT seismic data - acquired by the Bra silSpan Project - consist of pre-stack depth profiles migrated using the Kirchoff algorithm Kumar et al 2013 All seismic and borehole data were provided by ANP Brazil s National Agency of Petroleum Natural Gas and Biofuels Fig 2 2 2 Data interpretation workflow 2 2 1 Structural interpretation Fault systems were identified in this work based on the recognition and mapping of their structural styles geometries magnitudes of displacement orientations the superposition of deformation and kine matic relations and relative ages Their temporal relationships with respect to the sedimentary infill of adjacent syn-rift basins were addressed by mapping how each fault system controlled the growth and thinning of strata within specific seismic-stratigraphic sequences Hence the main criterion used to separate fault systems was the relative age of growth strata in discrete basins and sub-basins the faults were responsible for Fig 3 This included the recognition of a fault displacement and cross-cutting geometries and b stratigraphic se quences truncated by both local and regional unconformities The original geometries of faults and syn-rift strata when deformed by tec tonic movements were useful in interpreting their relative ages and kinematic histories e g Haupert et al 2016 Nemc ok 2015 Osmund sen and Pe ron-Pinvidic 2018 Peacock et al 2000 1 What is the role of rifted margins architecture and associated

analysis e g Birrell and Courtier 1999 Delvaux et al 1997 Fournier and Petit 2007 Lisle 1992 2004 Lisle and Leyshon 2004 Marrett and Allmendinger 1990 Petit 1987 Price and Cosgrove 1990 Rowland et al 2007 The aim was to establish a genetic relationship whereby the stratigraphic record responds to tectonic stimuli On rifting continental margins the stratigraphic record at the largest scale is hierarchically classified as being of the 1st-order According to Catuneanu 2022 2019b and Catuneanu et al 2011 2010 a 1st-order sequence must represent relatively conformable successions in the sense that internal unconformities do not disrupt its tectonic significance nor the continuity of a basin s palaeogeographic evolution In the case of sedimentary basins recording multiple tectonic events the limits of 1st-order sequences denote changes in basin type and are the most sig nificant within a sedimentary succession regardless of the time interval This paper characterizes and hierarchizes the stratigraphic sequences and related fault systems that make up the Santos Basin near its Outer High offshore SE Brazil Fig 1 It addresses the spatial and temporal evolution of faults and strata from a geodynamic point of view by considering 1st- to 4th-order stratigraphic sequences as having responded to syn-rift tectonics imposed at different scales of observation We therefore propose a novel temporal and spatial classification for faults developed on rifted continental margins This new classification high lights the role of each fault system in controlling syn-rift topography and sediment accommodation space across different scales of observation The main advantage of such a workflow is that it allows one to change between scales of observation while maintaining similar structural stratigraphic criteria and

Velha Formation Aptian pre-salt of the Santos Basin during the rift and sag phases conditioned the stratigraphic and sedimentological processes that controlled the distribution and quality of these reservoirs The understanding of how and with what intensity the structural evolution impacted the distribution of carbonate facies is crucial to carry out a predictive mapping of the reservoirs The present study was conducted in the Iracema area Tupi field where 5 seismic horizons and 74 faults were mapped with the objective of characterizing and restoring the structural framework and reconstructing the paleogeography of the reservoirs during the deposition of the Barra Velha Formation The study focuses on the interval deposited during the sag phase of the basin A paleobathymetry surface was constructed for the restored horizons referring to the basal limits of the lower and upper sag intervals considering the carbonate deposition depths based on recent analogous deposits and in accordance with previous studies carried out in the basin To exemplify the application of this paleobathymetric analysis a stratigraphic-sedimentological forward modeling was executed in the upper interval of the sag phase allowing to reproduce scenarios of the internal architecture of the carbonate platform The results demonstrate that the restored surface presents a better and predictive

transfer ncia de Iracema a orienta o da estrutura e das falhas mapeadas As principais falhas que originaram a Bacia de Santos no Eocret ceo nuclearam-se ao longo de estruturas preexistentes herdando a

presen a da zona de transfer ncia de Iracema de dire o NW-SE obl qua orienta o NE-SW dominante na bacia combina o que resulta na estrutura do S de Santos Magnavita et al 2010 influenciou na mudan a da

hip tese apresentada por Adriano et al 2022 est relacionada a uma terceira fase rifte associada s falhas de dire o NW-SE presentes na regi o de Iracema Esta terceira fase rifte correlata a deposi o do intervalo superior da Forma o Barra Velha que correspondem aos intervalos sag Superior e Inferior abordados neste estudo A movimenta o das falhas o principal motivador para que seja realizada a restaura o dos horizontes interpretados na s smica A restaura o estrutural confirmou a interpreta o s smica da exist ncia do horst de Iracema durante a fase sag Os horizontes restaurados indicam a ocorr ncia de posi es relativamente mais altas do que as observadas na s smica em alguns setores do reservat rio sugerindo a possibilidade de ocorr ncia de dep sitos carbon ticos mais porosos A restaura o estrutural tamb m impacta positivamente na modelagem de processos modificando a expectativa de ocorr ncia de f cies reservat rio e n o reservat rio Como exemplo a nordeste do po o B no

Santos basin Pre-salt Carbonate reservoirs The huge oil accumulations in the South Atlantic Pre-Salt section have driven studies that seek a greater un derstanding of the origin and evolution of these important reservoirs Lacustrine carbonate intraclastic deposits correspond to the main reservoirs in the B zios Field currently with the highest daily production wells in the world and in other Santos Basin fields However few studies were dedicated to these deposits due to the great complexity of Pre-Salt deposits and the lack of analogs These factors have generated intense controversies in the interpretation of their depositional models A systematic petrographic characterization allowed detailed char acterization of the textures and primary constituents in the rift and sag sections of a well in the B zios Field The bioclastic accumulations of the rift Itapema Formation show features indicative of reworking such as abrasion fragmentation and disarticulation of the bivalve bioclasts Moreover the bioclasts occur mainly within intraclasts and as nuclei of ooids characteristics of multicycle redeposition The massive structure of these deposits the lack of characteristic wave structures their distribution in lows and conspicuous mixing with stevensitic grains indicate their gravitational redeposition as result of the intense tectonic activity during the rift phase The sag phase Barra Velha Formation deposits are composed of intraclasts eroded from the in situ spherulites and shrubs These rocks are predominantly massive lack subaerial exposure features and display features that point to dynamic and multicyclic reworking Furthermore they occur intercalated with in situ deposits in high frequency even at a thin section scale These aspects along with the consistency of isotope values the widespread spatial distribution and preservation of stevensite across diverse Pre-Salt areas suggest that gravitational waves and currents redeposition models should be reevaluated We propose that internal waves generated by perturbations of the chemocline of a meromictic stratified lacustrine system promoted recurrent reworking of the in situ de posits This generated intraclastic levels with multicycle redeposition aspects often interlayered with the characteristic in situ deposits Understanding the processes that generated these deposits will contribute to reduce exploration risks and optimize hydrocarbon production from the intraclastic reservoirs 1 Introduction calcarenites known as coquinas as e g in the Mero Field Carlotto et al 2017 Abelha and Petersohn 2018 Barnett et al 2020 Intense controversy involves the interpretation of the depositional conditions of equivalent bioclastic accumulations in the adjacent Campos Basin opposing their

studies on the Santos Basin bioclastic rift de posits brought the same discussion on the dynamics of re-sedimentation involving reworking by current and waves Barnett et al 2020 Chinelatto et al 2020 redeposition by gravity flows Leite The Pre-Salt succession holds huge oil accumulations currently responsible for 75 of the total oil production of Brazil which reached the equivalent of 3462 million barrels of oil per day ANP 2023 Furthermore Santos Basin southeastern Brazilian margin accounts for 73 of total oil production and 75 of natural gas ANP 2023 high lighted by the Pre-Salt Tupi B zios

the most important reservoirs in the B zios Field and in other fields These rocks were initially interpreted as microbial deposits Carminatti et al 2008 Terra et al 2010 but their textural and isotopic characteristics suggest an abiotic chemical precipitation Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Gomes et al 2020 In addition this succession also presents thick packages of calcirudites and calcarenites composed of intraclasts reworked from the in situ deposits Barnett et al 2018 2021 Although these intraclastic deposits correspond to the main reservoirs in the B zios Field and significant exploration targets they received much less attention than the in situ Pre-Salt deposits Furthermore such thick and continuous intraclastic deposits are very rare in ancient and Recent lacustrine systems Therefore the focus of this study is to understand the processes that generated these reworked deposits within the rift and mainly within the sag section in order to contribute to the reduction of exploration risks and to optimize hydro carbon production from the Pre-Salt reservoirs et al 2022 covered the Precambrian crystalline basement Along the South Atlantic margins conjugated basins formed with structural sedimentary and configuration differences that determined the patterns of hydrocarbon accumulation Lentini et al 2010 Blaich et al 2011 Chaboureau et al 2013 Saller et al 2016 Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Aizprua et al 2019 According to Moreira et al 2007 the stratigraphic framework of Santos Basin can be divided into three main sequences rift Valanginian to Aptian post-rift Aptian and drift Albian to Holocene Carminatti et al 2008 divided the rift and post-rift Pre-Salt sequences into three sub-units bounded by unconformities lower sin-rift upper sin-rift and sag sequences During the rift stage mechanical subsidence developed an extensive half-grabens system creating abundant space of accommodation for sedimentation Milani et al 2007 Contreras

Abelha and Petersohn 2018 The rift sedimentation occurred in two phases the lower rift phase corresponding to the Pi arras Formation Barremian Fig 2 and the upper rift phase corresponding to the Itapema Formation Neo barremian to Eoaptian Fig 2 The Pi arras Formation is composed of proximal alluvial fans of conglomerates and sandstones and lacustrine sandstones siltites and shales of magnesian clays mostly stevensite and kerolite Moreira et al 2007 Leite et al 2020 This sequence corre sponds to the main deformation interval of the rift phase limited at the top by the Pre-Jiquia Unconformity The overlaying Itapema Formation was deposited mainly in shallow lacustrine environment in the final stage of the evolution of the rift half-grabens with decreased fault ac tivity This unit comprises calcirudites and calcarenites of bivalve and ostracod bioclasts intercalated with organic-rich shales which are the main source rocks of the basin Moreira et al 2007 Carlotto et al 2 Geological context The Santos Basin covers approximately 350 000 km2 of southeastern Brazilian margin extending to about 3000 m water depth being limited to the North with the Campos Basin by the Cabo Frio High and to the South with the Pelotas Basin by the Florianopolis High Fig 1 Moreira et al 2007 The origin of the Santos Basin is linked to the separation of Africa from South America during the Early Cretaceous Rifting devel oped diachronous from south to north forming a complex crustal stretching area with intense volcanism Blaich et al 2011 Gomes et al 2012 As a result of the rupture of

rift phase Modified from Barnett et al 2018 2017 Lebre 2019 Chinelatto et al 2020 Leite et al 2020 These bioclastic deposits known as coquinas occur across the South Atlantic rift basins of the Brazilian and West African margins Thompson et al 2015 During the early Aptian the Florianopolis High served as a barrier to marine influx allowing extensive lacustrine carbonate sedimentation along the structural highs Karner and Gambo a 2007 Szatmari and Milani 2016 The Barra Velha Formation was deposited in the post-rift phase sag of the basin Dias et al 1988 Moreira et al 2007 after regional uplift and erosion generated the so-called Pre-Alagoas uncon formity Fig 2 This unit was deposited in a broad shallow hyper alkaline lake Wright and Barnett 2015 Wright and Tosca 2016 Pietzsch et al 2018 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Wright 2022 During this stage the activity of the main rift faults ceased or decreased significantly indicating a predominantly thermal subsidence of the basin Moreira et al 2007 Lentini et al 2010 Blaich et al 2011 Buckley et al 2015 Wright and Barnett 2015 The sag section is essentially formed by magnesian clays which predominate in the deeper settings and by calcite spherulites and fascicular shrubs which predominate in the shallower settings Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2008 Terra et al 2010 and Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 interpreted these carbonates as microbial de posits but they were reinterpreted by many authors as product of abiotic chemical precipitation Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Her linger et al 2017 Tosca and Wright 2018 Wright and Rodriguez 2018 Lima and de Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Carvalho et al 2022 Wright 2022 Associated with these in situ deposits there are calcir udites and calcarenites of eroded and redeposited spherulitic and fascicular intraclasts Gomes et al 2020 Azere do et al 2021 Wright 2022 The rupture of the Florianopolis High barrier and the arid climate allowed the deposition of the thick evaporitic deposits of the Ariri For mation composed mainly of halite and anhydrite with other more soluble salts such as tachyhydrite carnallite and sylvite Szatmari et al 1996 Karner and Gambo a 2007 Moreira et al 2007 Lentini et al 2010 Szatmari and Milani 2016 During the Albian the oceanic crust expansion established open marine conditions Moreira et al 2007 largest producing field in Brazil with a production of approximately 772 Mboe d accounting for 24 of the total Pre-Salt productivity ANP 2023 According to Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 the thick car bonate packages of the Itapema and Barra Velha Formations in the B zios Field were deposited in complex tectono-stratigraphy settings with vertical and lateral facies variations indicating a heterogeneous distribution with a wide range of reservoir properties The sedimenta tion of the rift sequence was controlled by intense tectonism forming a series of horst graben and half-graben structures with thickness ranging from 200 m on the structural highs to 2800 m in the structural lows The lower rift sequence Pi arras Formation was highly faulted due to a complex transfer zone while the upper rift section Itapema Formation was thinner and less affected by the tectonic activity due to the rift expansion and subsidence decrease The carbonates from the sag section Barra Velha Formation were deposited on the topography generated after the Pre-Alagoas unconformity and less affected by syndepositional faulting In the B zios Field the evaporites of the Ariri Formation are up to 2650 m thick acting as an important regional seal Their basal layer is composed of anhydrite followed by thick halite intercalated with layers of anhydrite carnallite tachyhydrite and sylvite indicative of several marine water flooding and desiccation cycles Gamboa et al 2009 Many studies mainly with a focus on seismic aspects have been developed on the seismic and petrophysical log characterization of from the B zios Field reservoirs Castro 2019 Castro and Lupinacci 2019 2022 Dias et al 2019 Ferreira et al 2019a 2019b 2021a 2021b Lebre 2019 Macedo et al 2021a b Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 Mello and Lupinacci 2022 although none has detailed their petrographic characteristics According to Ferreira et al 2019b 2021a b three different seismic patterns are identified in the area build-ups debris and aggradational progradational carbonate platforms The interpreted build-up and debris seismic facies commonly occur aligned with faults display higher porosity and permeability and are inferred to be the best reservoirs Castro 2019 Castro and Lupinacci 2019 and Lebre 2019 concluded that the larger presence of clays is higher in Barra Velha Formation than in Itapema Formation which would nega tively impact the reservoir quality of some of the sag rocks However the average thickness of the net pay effective reservoir of the Barra Velha Formation is approximately three times greater than that of the Itapema Formation 2 1 B zios Field The B zios Field located in ultra-deep water 180 km off the Bra zilian coast has a total area of 850 km2 with reservoirs 5000 to 6000 m deep This supergiant Pre-Salt field was discovered in 2010 and since 2015 has been breaking production records being currently the second 3 Materials and methods This petrographic study was performed over 358 thin sections from a 3 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 well cored in the B zios Field of Santos Basin Fig 3 The cored interval covers about 82 m with sixty sidewall samples localized above the core The samples were impregnated with blue epoxy resin and the thin sections were stained with alizarin red and potassium ferricyanide so lution for the discrimination of carbonate minerals Dickson 1965 Systematic quantitative petrography descriptions were performed by counting 300 points per thin section along transects perpendicular to rock structure and fabric The textural aspects habits locations and paragenetic relations of primary and diagenetic constituents and pore types were recorded using the Petroledge software De Ros et al 2007 and documented in digital photomicrographs The analyzed samples were classified according to the De Ros and Oliveira 2023 system Scanning electron microscopy SEM analyzes were executed in ten selected polished and carbon-coated thin sections using backscattered electrons BSE These analyses were performed in order to identify the distribution of constituents and their relationships among each other and with porosity The analyses were executed in a JEOL-6610LV electron microscope equipped with a Brucker energy dispersive spec trometer EDS with a working distance ranging from 8 6 mm to 12 4 mm voltage of 12 kV and probe current of 9 3 10 5 A A A MicroMill equipment was used to collect the samples for isotopic analysis of in situ calcite aggregates Approximately 15 mg were collected in each of the 14 selected in situ samples Isotopic analysis was performed on 9 samples for C and O isotopes and on 5 samples for Sr isotopes Fig 3 with the objective of defining aspects of the paleoenvironmental conditions and diagenetic evolution The analysis of C and O stable isotopes of two samples of the Itapema Formation and seven samples from the Barra Velha Formation was made through a Kiel IV Carbonate Device equipment coupled to a Thermo Scientific Delta V Plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer IRMS at the Laboratory of Chemical Stratigraphy and Organic Geochemistry LGQM of the State University of Rio de Janeiro UERJ The results obtained were compared with the standard carbonate Vienna Pee Dee Belemnite VPDB and indicated by a defined parameter Rsample - Rstandard Rstandard 1000 where R C13 C12 The accuracy was 0 04 for 13C and 0 08 for 18O For Sr analysis isotopic ratios of two samples of the Itapema For mation and two samples from the Barra Velha Formation were measured with a Thermo Scientific multicollector Triton with a Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometer TIMS coupled to a plasma source ICPMS at the Laboratory of Isotopic Geology LGI of the Rio Grande do Sul Federal University UFRGS The isotopic ratios were normalized to 86 Sr 88Sr 0 1194 and each sample was analyzed to obtain 100 ratios whenever possible The analytical precision is 0 00001 internal pre cision and repeated analyzes of the NBS-987 international reference gave an average ratio of 0 710275 0 000012 external precision Fig 3 Integrated log of the studied core with the position of all

and peloidal siltites constituted essen tially by peloids and ostracod bioclasts are intensely replaced by microcrystalline calcite Fig 5C Hybrid sensu Zuffa 1980 siltites with abundant peloids are lami nated Fig 5D commonly bioturbated fractured and stylolitized locally with clotted texture suggestive of microbial deposition These deposits occur at the top of the unit close to the pre-Alagoas uncon formity and to the contact with the Barra Velha Formation Siliciclastic grains are in general angular to sub-angular monocrystalline quartz feldspars and micas mainly muscovite Peloids and ostracod bioclasts were intensely dolomitized and recrystallized The hybrid siltites show intercalation of levels with a predominance of dolomite which contain larger amounts of siliciclastic grains or calcite which commonly show clotted texture Fig 5D The rare dolostones Fig 5E were generated by total dolomitization of the peloidal and hybrid siltites hybrid arenites and calcarenites Owing to the intense replacement by blocky dolomite the peloids appear only as ghosts within the replacive dolomite Two unusual levels of spherulitic rocks Fig 5F occur at the base and in the middle of the cored Itapema Formation section The host sediment of these rocks was essentially composed of peloids and ostracod bio clasts The peloids served as nuclei for the precipitation of spherulitic calcite These anomalous spherulstones yielded 87Sr 86Sr values of 0 7115846 and 0 7116001 13C values of 0 47 and 0 10 VPDB and 18O values of 0 22 and 0 48 VPDB 4 1 Petrography of the Itapema Formation 4 1 1 Primary composition The analyzed carbonate rocks from the Itapema Formation are essentially constituted by carbonate allochems with rare siliciclastic grains quartz micas and feldspars The main allochems are bivalve and ostracod bioclasts with subordinate peloids ooids and intraclasts Table 1 Bivalve bioclasts Fig 4A are commonly disarticulated abraded and recrystallized or dissolved with the derived porosity filled with calcite cement Bivalve bioclasts also occur within intraclasts Fig 4A and ooids Ostracod bioclasts Fig 4B occur both dis articulated and articulated and are commonly associated with peloids Gastropods are rare commonly dissolved with the derived porosity filled by blocky calcite The peloids and ooids were originally composed of magnesium clays later totally

rift section of the Campos Basin e g Armelenti et al 2016 Goldberg et al 2017 Herlinger et al 2017 Peloids Fig 4C are very abundant predominantly with fine sand size while ooids Fig 4D show pre dominantly coarse sand size Most ooids are superficial with single thin cortical coating around the nuclei or polycomposite made by two or more ooids enveloped together The rare ooids showing radial structure were considered as originally carbonate ooliths Fig 4D Oncoids are rare showing irregular cryptocrystalline in places clotted envelopes Fig 4E generated through microbial probably cyanobacteria accretion The carbonate intraclasts are mainly peloidal Fig 4F but there are also macrocrystalline microcrystalline and spherulitic intraclasts ooidal-bioclastic intraclasts and less commonly microbial intraclasts with clotted texture and originally dolomitic intraclasts The complex reworking dynamics is illustrated by the occurrence of intraclasts inside other intraclasts and of ooids with intraclastic nuclei which will be discussed ahead 4 1 3 Diagenetic constituents Calcite is the most abundant diagenetic constituent occurring as microcrystalline crystals replacing originally argillaceous peloids and ooids as blocky Fig 6A and as prismatic rims Fig 6A 6B filling and lining interparticle intraparticle and moldic porosity originated by partial or complete dissolution of bioclasts ooids and other grains Fig 6B Calcite rims were commonly detached from grain surfaces and locally engulfed by blocky calcite Calcite mosaic Fig 5B replaced bivalve bioclasts partially preserving their original structure while drusiform prismatic calcite Fig 6C and blocky calcite filled intra particle and moldic pores generated by dissolution of bivalve bioclasts Blocky dolomite also occurs filling interparticle Fig 6D intraparticle and moldic porosity Fig 6B 6C and replacing grains The dolomite rhombs commonly replaced the blocky calcite Fig 6B Microcrystalline and macrocrystalline quartz and fibrous-radiated chalcedony replaced the grains partially or totally and filled the pore spaces of the hybrid arenites calcarenites and calcirudites Chalcedony rims covered the grains Fig 6E or the calcite rims Fig 6A while macrocrystalline quartz commonly filled the center of pores Fig 6E Microcrystalline quartz occurs mainly replacing ooids and peloids Fig 6E 6F while drusiform and macrocrystalline quartz replaced mainly the bivalve bioclasts Fig 6F Microcrystalline pyrite is commonly associated with the silica and dolomite In the silicified rocks pyrite occurs mainly marking the grains margins In the hybrid siltites pyrite occurs replacing the grains mainly the peloidal intraclasts and the dolomite rhombs and concentrated along stylolites Scarce pseudomatrix was locally produced by the compaction of mud intraclasts Rare macrocrystalline barite and pris matic celestite filled partially or totally the interparticle intraparticle and vugular pores 4 1 2 Lithologic types Hybrid arenites calcarenites calcirudites and peloidal siltites cf De Ros and Oliveira 2023 are the predominant rocks in the Itapema For mation These lithologic types range according to the compositional predominance and occur heterogeneously through the unit The hybrid arenites are mainly coarse rich in ooids subordinately in bivalve bio clasts peloids and peloidal intraclasts Fig 5A The bivalve bioclasts shells occur mainly within intraclasts and as nuclei in ooids Calcarenites and calcirudites composed mainly of bivalve bioclasts also known as coquinas are less common in the studied well Fig 5B The bivalve bioclasts are disarticulated often fragmented and abraded and exhibit a chaotic orientation These shells are frequently mixed with peloids Table 1 Quantitative data of main primary constituents of the Itapema Formation Primary constituents Average Maximum Ooids Peloids Oncoids Bivalve bioclasts Ostracod bioclasts Gastropod

Pray 1970 and vary according to the lithologic types Calcarenites hybrid arenites and calcirudites show mostly primary interparticle porosity and secondary intraparticle porosity from partial dissolution of mainly the ooids bivalve bioclasts and peloidal intraclasts Fig 7A The partial preservation of primary porosity is controlled mainly by the interplay between partial early cementation and compaction Moldic 5 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 Fig 4 Main primary constituents of the Itapema Formation in the B zios Field A Abraded and

acquired with uncrossed polarizers P pores were generated by total dissolution of the bivalve bioclasts and ooids Fig 7B In some samples the total dissolution of the grains was very intense and moldic

porosity Fig 7C Microporosity pores 10 m are common in the originally argillaceous ooids and peloids especially in the ooid envelopes Fig 7D Grain fracture porosity mainly of the bivalve bioclasts is rare Intercrystalline porosity occurs among inter particle and intraparticle dolomite and calcite cements In the peloidal arenites and siltites and the hybrid siltites moldic pores generated by the total dissolution of peloids and ostracod bio clasts are surrounded by preserved calcite rims Fig 7E Primary interparticle porosity is less common in these rocks owing to the intense calcite and dolomite cementation and to compaction Vugular pores formed by irregular dissolution of grains and cements intercrystalline and fracture porosity are common in the dolostones Fig 7F Fractures in the hybrid siltites are commonly filled by macrocrystalline calcite 4 2 Petrography of the Barra Velha formation 4 2 1 Primary constituents The main primary constituents of the reworked rocks of Barra Velha Formation Table 3 are intraclasts composed of spherulitic Fig 8A fascicular Fig 8B and microcrystalline calcite Fig 8C which are the result of erosion and redeposition of the in situ deposits Peloidal intra clasts Fig 8D ooids Fig 8E and peloids Fig 8F are also common Less common primary constituents comprise ostracod bioclasts silici clastic grains quartz feldspar and micas dolomitic and microbial intraclasts peloidal matrix phosphatic grains and carbonaceous fragments The intraclasts are commonly rounded to sub-rounded moderatelyto well-sorted with size ranging between fine-sand to pebble and occur in variable proportions Microcrystalline intraclasts Fig 8C occur mainly at the base of the analyzed Barra Velha section while spherulitic and fascicular Fig 8A intraclasts predominate at the top Owing to their original shapes spherulitic intraclasts are commonly well-rounded Fig 8A while the fascicular Fig 8B and microcrystalline Fig 8C are sub-rounded to sub-angular Fascicular and spherulitic intraclasts show the original internal structures of the aggregates cut by their present shapes Peloidal intraclasts occur subordinately Fig 8D 6 S D Altenhofen et al

and forming a pseudomatrix when compacted Mi crobial intraclasts with the typical clotted texture and dolomitic intra clasts are rare Some intraclasts present distinct features as the occurrence of the intraclasts inside other intraclasts and intraclasts combining microbial and abiotic features in the same grain As in the Itapema Formation the peloids and clay envelopes of ooids are completely replaced by microcrystalline calcite Fig 8F or dis solved without remnants of their original Mg-clay composition which is preserved in other Pre-Salt areas of Santos Basin e g Da Silva et al 2021 Carramal et al 2022 Carvalho et al 2022 and Campos Basin e g Herlinger et al 2020 Ooids Fig 8E commonly present spherulitic intraclastic nuclei and less commonly microcrystalline intraclastic nuclei Unlike the Itapema Formation most of the ooids analyzed in the Barra Velha section show only superficial and single cortical envelopes commonly abraded presenting irregular shapes Commonly fragments of the envelopes are detached from the grains and engulfed by inter particle cements The complex reworking dynamics are also observed in the sag section particles Some ooids were observed within the intra clasts and some ooids can contain an ooidal and intraclastic nucleus The peloids silt to fine sand in size Fig 8F occur in the Mg-clay matrix of the spherulstones and shrubstones commonly engulfed or replaced by the calcite aggregates and are the main components of the peloidal siltites Articulated and mainly disarticulated ostracod bioclasts are rare and occur mainly in the peloidal siltites and within the matrix of the in situ rocks at the base of the sag section Phosphatic bioclasts and carbona ceous fragments are rare occurring disseminated in the matrix of in situ rocks and in the peloidal siltites locally concentrated in some laminae of peloidal and hybrid siltites Spherical microorganisms with thin Mgclay probably originally organic walls are locally engulfed by the spherulites and shrubs filled and replaced by calcite The matrix among the calcite spherulites and shrubs of the in situ rocks was originally constituted essentially by magnesian clays mostly of stevensite-kerolite composition Wright and Barnett 2015 2020 Tosca and Wright 2015 Gomes et al 2020 Da Silva et al 2021 Carramal et al 2022 Netto et al 2022 with scarce siliciclastic grains In the analyzed samples the matrix was extensively replaced mainly by dolomite and silica making its recognition and quantification difficult In some cases the replacement by cryptocrystalline silica and lamellar magnesite preserved the original matrix lamination Other evidence of the former presence of matrix is the occurrence of dolomite rhombs floating in the inter-aggregate porosity indicating that dolomite partially replaced the Mg-clays matrix which was later dissolved 7 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 Fig 6 Main diagenetic features of the

incipient pressure dissolution and organic matter concentration Laminated hybrid siltites are composed of alternating levels of microcrystalline calcite and dolomite detrital components and less commonly ostracods organic matter and phosphatic fragments These rocks occur rarely at the base of the Barra Velha Formation intercalated with laminated and massive peloidal siltites spherulstones and mud stones Fig 9F Dolostones and cherts occur rarely generated by total dolomitization or silicification of the peloidal siltites and spherulstones Due to the intense replacement only ghosts of

symmetric ag gregates Fig 10A spherulites sensu Hodgson 1968 Schroeder 1972 Chafetz and Butler 1980 Verrecchia et al 1995 and as divergent fibrous asymmetric fascicular aggregates sensu Kendall 1977

microcrystalline calcite P F Peloids replaced by microcrystalline calcite P Grotzinger and Knoll 1999 known as shrubs Fig 10B The spherulites are considered eogenetic constituents sensu Cho quette and Pray 1970 since they grew by displacing and replacing the original unconsolidated matrix Wright and Barnett 2020 Carramal et al 2022 These crystal aggregates are spherical to sub-spherical with up to 1 mm of diameter with characteristic radial extinction which was in some cases lost due to recrystallization Fig 10A or dolomitization In some samples there are transitional forms between spherulites and fascicular aggregates such as asymmetric lobate and half spherulites The precipitation of the fascicular shrubs was partially eogenetic i e within the matrix as the spherulites and partially syngenetic i e on the water-sediment interface Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 In the analyzed samples the fascicular calcite aggregates occur associated with spherulites or as crusts Fig 10B in average 2 mm thick planar or slightly undulating intercalated with microcrystalline and laminated levels The shrubs are oriented sub-vertically coalesced or spaced showing more than one growth phase marked by inclusions or by branching As with the spherulites recrystallization or dolomitiza tion modified the original fibrous fabric of the aggregates Fascicular calcite also engulfed intraclasts and ooidal particles Commonly the spherulites and shrubs incorporated remnants of the matrix mainly the peloidal grains In addition to spherulitic and fascicular precipitates calcite also occurs less commonly with blocky and macrocrystalline habits filling intra-aggregate Fig 10C and inter-aggregate porosity due to dissolu tion of matrix or growth-framework pores among the shrubs in the crusts The precipitation of such coarse calcite cements normally engulfed the dolomite rhombs Rarely calcite occurs as discrete rims covering the spherulitic aggregates and with macrocrystalline habit filling fractures The matrix of the in situ rocks was totally dolomitized and silicified presenting levels with alternation of them Dolomite is a very abundant diagenetic constituent in the Barra Velha Formation occurring with blocky Fig 10D 10E mosaic and microcrystalline habits replacing the interstitial matrix cementing the inter-aggregate porosity mainly in the fascicular calcite crusts and less commonly replacing the calcite aggregates Rarely dolomite occurs as rims covering the calcite precipitates Silicification is very common in the in situ rocks and occurred pervasively forming cherts or as localized levels or areas Silica occurs as inter-aggregate cement of microcrystalline and macrocrystalline quartz cryptocrystalline silica and chalcedony fibrous rims and micro spherulitic aggregates Fig 10E 10F Chalcedony cryptocrystalline silica and microcrystalline quartz replaced the matrix preserving locally relict structures of the original lamination mainly at the top

also common Rare constituents include dawsonite magnesite barite pyrite and marcasite Fibrous and less commonly macrocrystalline and fibrousradiated dawsonite and lamellar and blocky magnesite occurs replac ing the matrix and the calcite aggregates more commonly at the top of the section Lamellar aggregates of magnesite follow the original matrix structure like bridges that filled the shrinkage pores from matrix dehydration Carramal et al 2022 Rarely macrocrystalline barite filled inter-aggregate and fracture porosity Microcrystalline pyrite and marcasite replaced the matrix and aggregates Seven in situ Barra Velha samples analyzed for stable carbon and oxygen isotopes yielded 13C values ranging from 1 06 to 2 81 VPDB and 18O ranging from 0 74 and 0 19 VPDB Two of these samples yielded 87Sr 86 values of 0 7126934 and 0 7128298 In the reworked rocks dolomite is the most important diagenetic constituent and occurs with blocky Fig 11A 11B and less commonly saddle habit filling the primary interparticle porosity and with macro crystalline to blocky habit replacing partially the grains Fig 11B and filling intraparticle moldic and fracture pores Cementation generally occurred before compaction as indicated by the loose packing observed in many samples Rarely the dolomite rhombs were engulfed by blocky calcite Fig 11C Calcite is a less common diagenetic constituent in the redeposited rocks occurring mainly with blocky habit filling interparticle Fig 11B and intraparticle porosity and replacing the grains Furthermore calcite occurs with poikilotopic habit filling the interparticle porosity and as rims often detached from the grains Fig 11D Blocky calcite also oc curs filling vugular porosity and fractures As in the Itapema Formation microcrystalline calcite replaced the originally argillaceous peloids and the envelopes of ooids Silicification is less common in the reworked than in the in situ rocks Silica occurs totally Fig 11E or partially filling the interparticle porosity mainly at the base of Barra Velha Formation as macro crystalline and drusiform quartz Fig 11E and less commonly as microcrystalline quartz and as chalcedony fibrous rims and micro spherulites Microcrystalline quartz Fig 11E and less commonly chalcedony occur replacing totally or partially the particles mainly the peloids and ooids Macrocrystalline quartz and chalcedony rims also fill and line the intraparticle porosity in the dissolved intraclasts and ooids Other less common constituent in the redeposited rocks is macro crystalline barite filling interparticle intraparticle and fracture porosity Some samples present mechanical compaction promoting the 11 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 Fig 10 Main diagenetic

quartz original matrix Fractures cross the matrix the calcite crusts and spherulites Dissolution of dolomite rhombs Fig 12C and less commonly blocky calcite formed intracrystalline porosity The chal cedony cements commonly present microporosity locally impregnated with oil The main porosity in the intraclastic calcarenites and calcirudites corresponds to preserved primary interparticle pores Fig 12D and secondary pores generated by the partial Fig 11B 12E or total dissolution Fig 12F of the intraclasts and ooids Dissolution along the margins of ooids was related to the shrinkage of their envelopes Car ramal et al 2022 The interparticle and intraparticle blocky dolomite calcite and magnesite cements also present partial dissolution Other less common pore types are fractures and those derived from the secondary interparticle dissolution of the peloidal pseudomatrix Porosity in hybrid siltites and mudstones is absent to very low limited to some fractures and to microporosity from the partial disso lution of the matrix and of the replacive microcrystalline calcite dolo mite and silica There are also rare moldic pores from the total dissolution of peloids and less commonly of

will approach the primary aspects observed in the studied de posits in relation to the main models presented in the literature including those from the equivalent deposits of the Campos and Kwanza basins The log signatures of the Itapema and Barra Velha formations in the studied well and representative lithologic types of the two units are shown in Fig 3 The log signatures in the studied interval are charac teristic of the units in many Santos Basin areas see e g Gomes et al 2020 Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 Camargo et al 2022 Carvalho et al 2022 Rebelo et al 2022 Owing to the absence or scarcity of potassium-rich clays gamma-ray values are generally low and some of the GR peaks correspond to uranium in bitumen The density NMR porosity and permeability of the Itapema Formation are much more homogeneous than those of the Barra Velha Formation due to the significant variation of the depositional and diagenetic features of the latter 5 1 Depositional conditions of the Itapema Formation Most of the works published about bioclastic accumulations depos ited in the rift phase were developed in the Coqueiros Formation the equivalent of the Itapema Formation in the adjacent Campos Basin Castro et al 1981 Schaller et al 1981 Baumgarten 1985 Bertani and Carozzi 1985 Dias et al 1988 Abraha o and Warme 1990 Horschutz and Scuta 1992 Carvalho et al 2000 Guardado et al

and Bosence 2018 Oliveira et al 2019 Olivito and Souza 2020 Some studies were published on the African margin Pre-Salt rift deposits Harris et al 1994 Harris 2000 Thompson et al 2015 Saller et al 5 Discussion The depositional conditions of the Itapema Formation and of the Barra Velha Formation have been a matter of heated debate in the literature due to the complex and unusual characteristics of the Pre-Salt deposits and the lack of ancient and modern analogs to serve as models 13 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 Baumgarten et al 1988 Dias et al 1988 Carvalho et al 2000 Castro 2006 which by definition are deposits composed of fragmented bio clasts with intense abrasion Pettijohn 1975 De Wet et al 2002 Scholle and Ulmer-Scholle 2003 Fl gel 2004 Gierlowski-Kordesch 2010 The rift bioclastic deposits of Campos and Santos basins were mostly interpreted as product of reworking of waves and or currents induced by storms Carvalho et al 2000 Muniz 2013 Thompson et al 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2017 2018 Mizuno et al 2018 Barnett et al 2020 Chinelatto et al 2020 Olivito and Souza 2020 Antunes 2021 However the absence of stratification and lamination i e structures typical of wave deposits the poor sorting and chaotic to concave-up orientation of the bioclasts in many of the bioclastic deposits led Goldberg et al 2017 to reinterpreted most of the bioclastic rift deposits of Campos Basin as redeposited by gravity flows The same was interpreted by Harris 2000 for the equivalent rift bioclastic carbonates of the Toca Formation in the Congo Basin In addition Goldberg et al 2017 described that the Campos Basin bioclastic deposits are commonly distributed in the rift half-graben lows characteristic indic ative of gravitational redeposition and show conspicuous mixing with stevensitic grains As stevensite precipitates only under highly alkaline conditions which are incompatible with the survival of bivalves this would indicate the re-depositional mixing of the two constituents Armelenti et al 2016 Goldberg et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 Such gravitational redeposition makes sense within the tectonic context of the rift phase which actively controlled the depositional geometries and facies distribution Guardado et al 2000 The rift phase recurrent tectonic pulses remobilized shallow lacustrine deposits to the deeper areas Goldberg et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 considered that beyond tectonism storms and or slope destabilization would be responsible for high-density bioclastic gravity flows in the Tupi Field area of Santos Basin Under such conditions the composition of the re-sedimented deposits would be controlled by the tectono-sedimentary dynamics and by the original composition of the marginal deposits without direct relation to the creation of accommodation space by transgressive and regressive events Goldberg et al 2017 Most likely the two models would have coexisted in the dynamic rift conditions with deposits reworked by waves and currents in shallow waters and redeposited by gravitational flows into deep settings This is considered by some authors for bioclastic deposits from the Campos Basin Mizuno et al 2018 Oliveira et al 2019 and the Santos Basin Carlotto et al 2017 Chinelatto et al 2020 Leite et al 2020 Rocha et al 2021 Carlotto et al 2017 interpreted the seismic structure of bioclastic reservoirs from the Mero Field Libra Area of the Santos Basin as mounds surrounded by progradational to chaotic wedges of deeper re-sedimented deposits More recently Barnett et al 2020 concluded that the model of gravitational re-sedimentation is not applicable to the Mero Field considering the scarcity of sin-sedimentary deformation features and the predominance of paleocurrents parallel to the coast For those authors the mounds observed by Carlotto et al 2017 are cli noforms up to 100 m thick that represent large bars produced through the re-working of the bivalves by shore-parallel currents as also inter preted for Campos Basin by Olivito and Souza 2020 and not by gravitational re-sedimentation The 87Sr 86Sr values 0 7115846 and 0 7116001 for two anomalous spherulitic samples collected from the Itapema Formation section of the studied well are significantly less radiogenic than those of the sag spherulstones 0 7126934 and 0 7128298 Pietzsch et al 2018 Lima et al 2020 The 87Sr 86Sr values of these two anomalous rift spherul stones correspond to those of the coquina samples characteristic of the rift interval On the other hand the 13C and 18O values of these samples 13C 0 47 and 0 10 VPDB and 18O 0 22 and 0 48 VPDB are quite similar to those of the sag Barra Velha Formation Pietzsch et al 2018 Wright 2022 Therefore even if similar

analyzed bioclastic deposits predominantly show features indicative of reworking These include the abrasion fragmentation and disarticulation of the bivalve bioclasts Fig 4A and their occurrence within intraclasts Rocha et al 2021 Barnett et al 2020 and as nuclei in ooids Fig 4 A 13A Another feature indicative of redeposition is the common mixing of bivalve bioclasts with peloids ooids and intraclasts originally constituted of stevensite or other Mg-clays Fig 4A 5A 5B as the latter are formed in highly alkaline environments incompatible with the survival of bivalves Goldberg et al 2017 Furthermore the occurrences of intraclasts within other intraclasts of ooids with intra clastic nuclei and of ooids within intraclasts corroborate the complex dynamic multicyclic reworking Fig 13 The

et al 2018 Wright and Barnett 2020 Carvalho et al 2022 Wright 2022 The lack of analogs of the Pre-Salt sag deposits generated a series of conflicting depositional models The unusual lacustrine carbonates spread along at least 330 000 km2 considering their known extension in Santos Campos and Kwanza basins Wright 2022 and probably up to 1 000 000 km2 considering the extension of the overlying evaporites There are no compatible or even partially equivalent occurrences with the extension and the types of deposits of the Pre-Salt sag succession in the geological record or in Recent environments making the identifi cation of the conditions of their formation quite challenging Therefore even the main depositional environment of the Pre-Salt succession has been widely discussed in the literature from epiconti nental shallow marine Dias 2005 to transitional between continental and shallow marine Moreira et al 2007 Carminatti et al 2008 For migli et al 2009 Gomes et al 2009

conditions of the Barra Velha formation The Pre-Alagoas unconformity Moreira et al 2007 marks a very expressive lithological change from the bioclastic deposits of the Ita pema Formation to the chemical deposits of the Barra Velha Formation indicating very distinct environmental and lacustrine system conditions In the study this change is observed by the disappearance of the bivalve bioclasts which are very common in the Itapema Formation Above the unconformity the in situ deposits are essentially constituted by spher ulitic and fascicular calcite and by Mg-clay laminated and peloidal matrix with subordinate siliciclastic silt and fine sand The composition of reworked deposits from the Barra Velha Formation is also clearly distinct from the reworked rift deposits since they are essentially composed of intraclasts eroded from the in situ deposits The high-frequency intercalation of the reworked and in situ deposits is also noteworthy The occurrence of stevensite and the remarkable absence of fauna except for rare occurrences of ostracods and phos phatic bioclasts point to a highly restricted and alkaline environment where mineral precipitation was primarily governed by the 15 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 Fig 13 Multicyclic reworking characteristics of the Itapema Formation A Bivalve bioclasts within

photomicrographs acquired with uncrossed polarizers fauna of almost exclusively ostracods and the values of 87Sr 86Sr significantly higher than those of Cretaceous marine waters are evi dence of a non-marine origin Pietzsch et al 2018 Wright 2022 The dry climate promoted intense evaporation of the lake waters what combined with the volcanic basement and the coeval magmatism and hydrothermalism resulted in an extensive alkaline system although without large-scale desiccation and exposure Pietzsch et al 2018 2020 Wright 2022 On the other hand the suggestion of a system consisting of small isolated lakes with only episodic lateral connection and extensive exposed areas as proposed e g by Arienti et al 2018 and Farias et al 2019 is contradicted by the lateral continuity of the seismic reflectors and stratigraphic units Wright and Barnett 2017 and by the occur rence of the same facies and 13C and 18O values in the Santos Campos and Kwanza basins Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Pietzsch et al 2020 The limited variation of the 13C and 18O values of the in situ samples analyzed in the studied well 13C ranging between 1 06 and 2 81 VPDB and 18O between 0 74 and 0 19 VPDB are compatible with the values reported in the literature for the sag carbonates Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Farias et al 2019 Lima et al 2020 Pietzsch et al 2020 and indicate a closed and relatively large lacustrine system Sabato Ceraldi and Green 2017 Pietzsch et al 2018 2020 Such system would have involved equilibration between the lake water and the atmosphere through CO2 degassing as well as significant evapora tion Pietzsch et al 2020 Together with these aspects there is a lack of features characteristic of exposure within the sag interval Such aspects should include calcretes and dolocretes with meteoric 18O values vadose pendular and meniscus cements oxidation and clay cutans cf Esteban and Klappa 1983 Railsback et al 2012 Additionally the original stevensite matrix is commonly preserved while the subaerial exposure of stevensite would extensively promote its alteration to sepiolite cf Chahi et al 1997 Pozo and Calvo 2018 All these aspects indicate that the pre-salt sag constituted a single vast lacustrine system rather than multiple small lakes A microbial origin has been proposed by some authors for the characteristic in situ deposits made of calcite fascicular shrubs and spherulites and Mg-clays e g Terra et al 2010 Rezende and Pope 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Mercedes-Mart n et al 2017 Kirkham and Tucker 2018 Chafetz et al 2018 Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Ara jo et al 2022 However the fibrous fabric and the stable isotope composition of the calcite shrubs and spherulites indicate that they are a product of abiotic chemical precipitation Wright and Barnett 2015 Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 Gomes et al 2020 Wright and Barnett 2020 Wright 2022 Their 13C and 18O values indicate a relative equilibrium between atmospheric and lake water CO2 Pietzsch et al 2020 The deposition of lacustrine carbonate facies of the sag was prefer entially developed on structural highs remaining from the erosion along the Pre-Alagoas unconformity as in the Tupi Field Carvalho et al 2022 Sommer et al 2022 or created by reactivation of the rift system faults what apparently was the case in the B zios Field Ferreira et al 2019a Macedo et al 2021b Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 Some of the reactivated faults apparently controlled the genesis of car bonate mounds interpreted in the seismic lines as well as the hydro thermal alteration of some Pre-Salt reservoirs Lima et al 2020 Hunt 2021 Mendes et al 2022 The mound aspect of sag carbonate structures seen in the Pre-Salt seismic lines e g Minzoni et al 2020 and the shrub morphology characteristic of the in situ deposits has conducted some authors e g Terra et al 2010 Boyd et al 2015 Virgone et al 2021 Erthal et al 2022 to interpret part of the deposits as travertines However the fast complex facies variations away from the spring conduits and the frac tionated stable isotopes values characteristic of subaerial travertines e g Gandin and Capezzuoli 2008 Fouke 2011 are absent from the Pre-Salt deposits as are also absent subaerial exposure features Some of the mounds may have been produced by sub-lacustrine travertine sys tems Della Porta 2015 However the morphological and isotopic as pects of the fascicular shrub deposits of these mounds are identical to those of the shrubstones distributed widely and away from the mounds Rodr guez-Berriguete et al 2022 examined specifically the potential analogies of the Pre-Salt shrub deposits with travertines observing that they totally differ in the lateral and vertical facies changes in saturation 16 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 conditions and flow energy They concluded that travertines are not a good analogue for Pre-Salt reservoir geometry and facies distribution although potentially providing clues on how the shrubs were precipi tated Therefore the characterization of some of the seismically iden tified mounds as sublacustrine travertines requires further investigation Evaluating the origin of the intraclastic deposits from the Barra Velha Formation Barnett et al 2018 2021 defined two distinct depositional configurations for the extensive and continuous packages of intraclastic rudstones and grainstones that appear intercalated with the in situ shrub and spherulite deposits of the Barra Velha Formation The first would be characterized by well-sorted sharp-based fining-up packages with mainly planar low angle stratification locally planar cross lamination deposited along the escarpment and dip slope of fault blocks and interpreted as carbonate fan delta shorelines with wave-reworked sheet flood or terminal splay deposits as also interpreted by Wright 2022 The second would be defined by coarser immature and thick packages adjacent to narrow and elongated mounds located along faulted blocks margins interpreted as formed by the subaerial disaggregation of mounds composed mainly of shrubs However Wright and Rodriguez 2018 argued that the seismic lines presented by Barnett et al 2018 fail to meet the Burgess et al 2013 criteria for identifying carbonate buildups which include for example high-angle margins reflector thickening and increase in steepness seismic facies differentiation onlap fracturing and collapse truncation of reflectors by karst among others Wright and Rodriguez 2018 commented additionally that the seismic facies showing apparent cli noform features can be attributed either to seismic effects of the over lying evaporites or to post-depositional tectonics A particularly important aspect of the Pre-Salt intraclastic facies is their frequent occurrence over highs in diverse areas where the shrubstones were also deposited This seems to occur for instance in the Tupi Field Carvalho et al 2022 Sommer et al 2022 in the B zios Field Ferreira et al 2021a 2021b Tavares dos Santos and Gordon 2021 in other areas of the Santos Basin Camargo et al 2022 Rebelo et al 2022 and in the Kwanza Basin Saller et al 2016 This distri bution is not compatible with a gravitational model for these occurrences Centimetric intercalations between intraclastic and in situ deposits are very frequent in the analyzed well The same was observed by Azere do et al 2021 Carvalho et al 2022 and Rodr guez-Berriguete et al 2022 indicating rapid changes in the hydrodynamic conditions Along the well the high frequency intercalation of in situ and reworked deposits occurs even at a thin section scale Fig 14 The intercalation of intraclastic and in situ deposits is observed both by the recurrent erosion Fig 14 Examples of intercalations of chemical in situ and hydrodynamic intraclastic deposits observed at thin section scale indicative of a dynamic depositional process changes A and B Calcarenite composed

intraclasts P and XP E and F Shrubs engulfing ooids and intra clasts XP 17 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American Earth Sciences 138 2024 104863 and redeposition of shrubs and spherulites and by the encrustation of intraclasts and ooids by fascicular calcite Fig 14 Frequently this alternation occurs as millimeter-thin layers Furthermore the intraclasts typically exhibit a rounded to sub-rounded shape and show a moderate to good sorting This distribution and textural characteristics are un likely to result from gravitational redeposition Gravitational deposits formed through slope redeposition of shallow water carbonate sedi ments typically exhibit restricted spatial distribution and strong lateral grain size variations Playton et al 2010 These patterns contrast with the commonly widespread distribution and good selection of most redeposited Pre-Salt facies Nevertheless subaqueous gravitational redeposition remains a viable mechanism for some intraclastic deposits close to the Pre-Salt mounds characterized by poor sorting and coarse grain size Fig 15A The importance and extension of this process was probably limited by the absence of sub aerial exposure and the limited syndepositional tectonism in the succession The interlayering between fascicular calcite and intraclastic deposits was interpreted by Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 and Carvalho et al 2022 as product of the activity of waves and currents based on observed sedimentary structures indicative of tractive processes such as low-angle cross-stratification wave ripples and hummocky cross-stratification The same was interpreted by Saller et al 2016 for the intraclastic deposits of the Kwanza Basin However such structures are not observed in the analyzed reworked rocks which are predomi nantly massive Wave reworking remains nevertheless a viable rede position process in a huge lacustrine system such as the interpreted South Atlantic Pre-Salt sag Fig 15B Another mechanism that could have promoted the observed subtle and recurrent re-deposition would be internal waves Ba denas et al 2012 Pomar et al 2012 Morsilli and Pomar 2012 Internal waves are generated by hydrostatic perturbation of the interface chemocline between a less dense upper level epilimnion and a lower denser hy polimnion water in stratified meromictic saline lakes Munk 1981 Apel 2002 or restrict marine gulfs or lagoons In stratified water bodies perturbations in the chemocline are common and may be pro moted by superficial currents and or waves wind stress fluctuations subaqueous slides or by tectonic activity Pomar et al 2012 Internal waves have lower frequency and larger amplitude than surface waves The breaking of internal waves occurs where the chemocline intersects the bottom leading to episodic reworking and transport of sediments Pomar et al 2012 Pomar and Haq 2016 According to Pomar et al 2012 these deposits can be concentrated in discrete intervals There fore internal waves would provide a viable mechanism for the genera tion of thin intraclastic levels and their high frequency intercalation with in situ deposits Fig 15C As previously discussed such high frequency changes in the depo sitional conditions cannot be attributed to lake level variations as proposed by e g Gomes et al 2020 Pietzsch et al 2020 Azere do et al 2021 Carvalho and Fernandes 2021 Wright 2022 Tonietto et al 2023 and Rodr guez-Berriguete et al 2022 considering the huge dimensions and the lack of evidence of subaerial exposure of the Pre-Salt lacustrine system Fluctuations in the lake level are typically regarded as the main factor contributing to changes in the water chemistry of most lacustrine systems However the recurrent and high frequency variations in the chemical composition and depositional en ergy of the very large alkaline Pre-Salt lacustrine system cannot be attributed to this mechanism For this system a scenario with a near constant lake level where the variations arise from oscillations within a stratified system would be more suitable Another significant observation within the reworked deposits in volves the occurrence of multicycle redeposition Fig 16 There are ooids within intraclasts intraclasts within ooids and intraclasts within intraclasts This occurrence of multiple cycles within the same grain is indicating a dynamic environment characterized by frequent fluctua tions in the hydrodynamic conditions as suggested by Carramal et al 2022 This could be better explained by the perturbations caused by internal waves Fig 15C leading to recurrent reworking The observed Barra Velha Formation ooids are primarily constituted by thin commonly single clay envelopes around intraclastic nuclei Fig 8E 14B as reported by Carramal et al 2022 for the Tupi Field area This contrasts with the rift section ooids which present thicker envelopes around siliciclastic volcanoclastic or bioclastic nuclei Ber tani and Carozzi 1985 Rehim et al 1986 Armelenti et al 2016 Goldberg et al 2017 Leite et al 2020 Although ooids are generally associated with relatively high-energy conditions these superficial ooids may have been formed in relatively lower energy conditions than in the rift interval through heterogeneous precipitation over their larger intraclastic nuclei Frequently the observed superficial ooids occur as discrete levels Fig 14 A and B intercalated with in situ levels The sag ooids show signs of reworking during further redeposition events Car ramal et al 2022 represented by abraded margins and partial pres ervation of the envelopes mostly on the concave portions of the grains surfaces Such recurrent reworking of calcite intraclasts as nuclei of clay ooids later reworked might be attributed to frequent hydrodynamic perturbations recurrently eroding and redepositing the grains Fig 15C The clay peloids may have been deposited in intermediate energy conditions between those of the ooids and the laminated Mg-clay deposits characteristic of the sag Armelenti et al 2016 Herlinger et al 2017 Part of the peloids may have been formed by flocculation due the salinity variations Carramal et al 2022 Some of these particles may be associated with the reworking of the previously deposited laminated clays 6 Conclusions The systematic petrographic analysis of the intraclastic deposits from the rift Itapema and sag Barra Velha Formation within a B zios Field well exhibited the complex nature of the reworked pre-salt deposits Observations regarding textures and primary constituents were compared with those described in the proposed published in order to understand the depositional processes and environments In the Itapema Formation bioclastic deposits predominantly show features indicative of reworking as abrasion fragmentation and disarticulation of the bivalve bioclasts and their occurrence within intraclasts and as nuclei of ooids The complexity of the particles points to a dynamic and multicyclic reworking The distribution in lows chaotic orientation and the common mixing of bivalve bio clasts with peloids intraclasts and ooids originally constituted of stevensite or other Mg-clays indicates gravitational redeposition Nevertheless features indicative of waves and currents observed in other pre-salt areas suggest that both gravitational and wave and or current-driven reworking processes likely coexisted Conversely the intraclastic deposits of the Barra Velha Formation consist of intraclasts eroded from in situ spherulitic and fascicular shrub deposits These reworked deposits showing features of multi cycle redeposition and are widely distributed and often intercalated with in situ deposits throughout the sag interval Considering this the two models proposed in the literature to explain the formation of these deposits are controversial The lack of subaerial exposure features good sorting and occurrence on structural highs of many sag intraclastic deposits seem to exclude a gravitational redeposition model Likewise the lack of structures indicative of traction processes such as low-angle and hummocky cross-stratification current and wave ripples do not support an interpretation of reworking by waves and currents for most examined reworked rocks which exhibit a pre dominantly massive structure Internal waves generated through perturbation of the chemocline in the large stratified meromictic alkaline lacustrine system may have been responsible for the subtle and recurrent observed re-deposition 18 S D Altenhofen et al Journal of South American

Geological setting aspects from classic well-documented carbonate lake deposits 1 The con guration of Cretaceous horsts and grabens generated many islands surrounded by an extensive lake or many small lakes with variable connectivity through time Pietzsch et al 2018 2 The siliciclastic lake shoreline is located far to the west from the areas of hydrocarbon exploration interest Dias 2005 3 Carbonate deposits appear to be laterally continuous over tens of kilometres Carminatti et al 2008 4 The carbonates are comprised of three main components and detrital material derived from them shrubs millimetre-scale brous laminae and spherulites Wright and Barnett 2015 Published articles describing these Pre-salt deposits have tried to t them within pre-existing facies schemes Wright and Barnett 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Wright and Barnett 2017 Herlinger et al 2017 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Arienti et al 2018 Artag o 2018 Sartorato 2018 Farias et al 2019 Tanaka et al 2018 Lima and De Ros 2019 Wright and Barnett 2019 However this has given rise to a confusing range of terms to describe a single rock fabric For example a rock composed of shrub-like calcite crystals has been classi ed variously as a stromatolite and a thrombolite Terra et al 2010 Muniz and Bosence 2015 as fascicular calcite crust Herlinger et al 2017 Lima and De Ros 2019 or as in situ shrubs Wright and Barnett 2015 or shrub-like facies Farias et al 2019 Similarly rocks composed of spherulites have been classi ed as spherulite-dominated lithologies Wright and Barnett 2015 as Mg-clay with spherulites facies and spherulitite Farias et al 2019 and as stevensitic claystones with calcite spherulites Lima and De Ros 2019 In contrast the abundant ne-grained facies are widely described as laminites Lima and De Ros 2019 Muniz and Bosence 2015 There has been considerable discussion about the way in which established terminology to describe facies can best be applied in a Pre-salt context In many cases these terms are associated with distinct paleoenvironmental conditions and or formation processes There is a clear need for a facies classi cation scheme based on the proportion of components that characterizes the lacustrine sediments of the Pre-salt and that is distinct from a process-based classi cation and thus can help evaluate alternative models of formation Any such scheme should also allow evaluation of the variability of these components on a micro- and macroscale in order to understand variations through the stratigraphic succession and to allow a proper facies upscaling Our objective in this paper is to propose a new facies classi cation scheme in order to document in a more meaningful manner the vertical trends in sediment texture and composition for the lacustrine carbonates of the Pre-salt Barra Velha Formation in our area of study of the Santos Basin Fig 1 This is based on the textural and mineralogical features of the rocks as seen today and considers the relative abundance of the three end-member components that are formed in situ mud dolomite calcite silica and Mg-clay calcite spherulites and fascicular calcite shrubs In addition the proposed scheme takes into account the relative contribution of depositional and early diagenetic components sediment mineralogy and the degree of dissolution as well as any reworking of in-situ sediment Although developed for the database of Barra Velha Formation we believe this scheme may have wider application in supporting systematic and consistent descriptions and interpretations of deposits from both Barra Velha Formation from other pre-salt areas and a range of comparable alkaline lake systems with similar facies It is worth to mention that our area of study does not include all facies described in other areas such as the microbial silici ed boundstone in Kwanza Basin Saller et al 2016 As an example of the application of the new facies scheme the occurrence of the various facies types is combined with the abundance of detrital grains and trace element variations to characterize metre-scale ideal cycles within the Barra Velha succession and to propose alternative process-based models of changes in the environment of deposition The southern domain of the South Atlantic is composed of a number of extensive basins which include the Santos and Campos basins o shore Brazil Fig 1A and the Kwanza and Namibe basins o shore southwest Africa These have been interpreted as resulting from two phases of extension during the pre-rift stage of South Atlantic opening in the Late Hauterivian Early Barremian The succeeding rift phase in the later Barremian-Aptian lasted 5 6 My and was characterized by tilting of fault-blocks and growth strata in upper continental crust followed by the development of a exural and continuous sag basin Chaboureau et al 2013 The Santos Basin is located on the southeastern Brazilian margin between the Campos Basin in the north and the Pelotas Basin in the south east of the Brazilian states of S o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro Fig 1B It is one of the most extensive o shore brazilian basins with an area of 352 000 km2 and a current water depth of up to 3 000 m The main structural features are the Cabo Frio High to the northeast the Florian polis Platform to the southwest the Santos hinge line to the west which marks the external western limit of the salt Ariri Formation and the S o Paulo plateau to the east Our area of interest is located in region of the Santos Outer High in the central part of the Santos Basin Fig 1C Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 performed a restoration from balanced cross-sections and concluded that this area of the Santos basin did not undergo structure inversion which implies the actual structure high was also a palaeohigh throughout Barra Velha deposition The basement of the Santos Basin is composed of Precambrian metamorphic rocks Tholeiitic ood basalt formed during the early stages of rifting in the Lower Cretaceous Camburi Formation is the equivalent of the Cabi nas Formation in the Campos Basin and it has been dated to 134 122 Ma Mizusaki et al 1992 The sediments of the Santos Basin Fig 2 are divided into three super-sequences rift postrift and drift Moreira et al 2007 The rift super-sequence is composed of continental siliciclastics talc-stevensite ooids with interbedded lacustrine coquinas and organic-rich shales of the Pi arras and Itapema formations This was followed by a post-rift super-sequence comprising lacustrine carbonates and shales of the Barra Velha Formation which is followed by evaporitic deposits of anhydride and halite locally with more soluble salts such as carnallite sylvite and tachyhydrite forming the Ariri Formation Three major unconformities are important for understanding the Barra Velha Formation the basal Pre-Alagoas Unconformity PAU at the top of the coquina deposits an internal unconformity called the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity IAU and the Salt Base Unconformity SBU that caps the formation Fig 2 Finally the basin evolved into a passive-margin basin with an early drift supersequence represented by shallow-marine platform carbonates of the Guaruj Formation followed by platform drowning and deeper-water sediments of the Itanha m Formation High-frequency basic ideal or elementary cycles consisting of a regular repetition of facies have been recognized in these lacustrine carbonates in the Santos and Campos basins Dias 2005 Wright and Barnett 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Liechoscki de Paula Faria et al 2017 Arienti et al 2018 Artag o 2018 Sartorato 2018 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 The basic cycles are represented as having a thickness of 1 2 m although examples range from 0 75 to 5 m These cycles typically are comprised of mud-grade laminated carbonates followed by units containing millimetre-diameter spherulites and nally units dominated by millimetre centimetre calcitic crystal shrubs Wright and Barnett 2015 These authors interpreted mudstone-claystone-laminite facies to have formed in the relatively deep-water part of the lake The shrubs formed on the oor of the lake in many cases followed by subaerial exposure and the generation of breccias suggesting deposition in shallow water or during a period of shallowing Whilst there is general agreement over the character of the proposed cycles there is still intense debate about many aspects of these Barra Velha sediments These include the biological or abiotic 2 Marine and Petroleum Geology 113 2020 104176 J P Gomes et al Fig 1 Location of the

and 93 m respectively whereas at the other sites core lengths were 30 m 12 m 30 m and 27 m Fig 3 totalizing 389 m of described core For two wells 7 and 8 only sidewall cores are available 778 sidewall cores and 1143 plugs were prepared from blue epoxy resin-impregnated samples Samples were stained with Alizarin red-S and potassium ferricyanide solution to aid the identi cation of carbonate minerals as outlined by Dickson 1966 All thinsections were examined by petrographic microscope and the relative abundance of components was determined for all samples Quantitative petrography was performed on 10 representative thin-sections by counting 200 points per sample to evaluate the texture of the carbonate grains and diagenetic constituents The methodology used by Muniz and Bosence 2015 to interpret origin of most of the facies whether the spherulites are primary or early diagenetic and the composition of the associated ne grains some of which were subsequently dissolved organic matter related to extracellular polymeric substances or magnesium clay minerals Our work and that of others Dias 2005 Wright and Barnett 2015 Muniz and Bosence 2015 Arienti et al 2018 Artag o 2018 Sartorato 2018 Farias et al 2019 Lima and De Ros 2019 suggests that in fact there are other types of basic cycle with di erent facies associations 3 Materials and methods This paper focuses on data from eight wells distributed along the horst structure of the Santos Outer High Fig 1C The cores available mostly come from the upper section of the Barra Velha Formation above the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity with additional material from sidewall 3 Marine and Petroleum Geology 113 2020 104176 J P Gomes et al Fig 2 Lower Cretaceous stratigraphic chart for the Santos Basin adapted from Moreira et al 2007 and ostracod biozones modi ed from Pietzsch et al 2018 The present study focusses on the Barra Velha Formation which is bounded by the Pre-Alagoas and Salt Base unconformities and separated into the Lower and Upper Barra Velha Formation by the Intra-Alagoas Unconformity The Barra Vellha Formation was deposited during the Alagoas local stage which is correlated to ostracod biozone 011 and broadly to the Aptian Moreira et al 2007 Fig 3 Sample distribution within the Barra Velha Formation which is 500 m thick in the studied area Cores are available from the upper Barra Velha Formation of six out

sepiolite illite and mixedlayer minerals kerolite smectite and illite smectite Souza et al 2018 Madrucci et al 2019 Spherulites The spherulites are spherical to sub-spherical calcite aggregates with radial extinction that commonly are dolomitized or recrystallized Spherulites from ten thin sections were measured and range in diameter from 0 1 mm to 4 mm with a mean of 1 mm 0 3 standard deviation n 800 and a mode of 0 6 mm Figs 6c h and 7 The low variance in their size distribution suggests the same process of formation for all spherulites A notable exception is the small number of samples n 3 that show normal or inverse grading at the thin-section scale suggesting a relationship between spherulite size and an ideal combination of water chemistry and hydrodynamic conditions In some cases it is possible to recognize nuclei composed of cryptocrystalline micrite clay minerals and more rarely a fragment of ostracod The calcitic bro-radial texture is preserved in most of the samples but chalcedonic and micro-quartz replacement locally results in the loss of original fabric Some spherulites are asymmetric with preferential growth in one particular direction In most cases spherulites tend to grow upwards whereas in some layers the spherulites grow parallel to the bedding Some grains are a mixture of a fascicular component similar to a shrub and yet show a bro-radial texture characteristic of a spherulite In these situations the volumetrically dominant of the two textures is used to determine the component name Shrubs The term shrub is applied in this study to the ray crystal crust de ned by Folk et al 1985 emphasizing the morphological similarity to fascicular-optic calcite sensu Kendall 1977 with a divergent optic-axis pattern within each crystal away from the substrate Shrubs are composed of brous to extremely coarse bladed calcite crystals with the long axis of their fan-shaped structure ranging from 0 15 to 6 5 mm in length Some shrubs incorporate random ne detrital grains or rarely bioclasts within their structure Within an individual layer shrubs are oriented parallel to one another varying from densely packed 0 2 mm between shrub central axes to widely spaced 4 mm spacing Fig 6 a and b In some samples it is possible to identify more than one growth phase resulting in a composite shrub that extends up to 20 mm The shrubs occur predominantly as horizontal layers and locally form low domal structures Terra et al 2010 Wright and Barnett 2015 Rezende and Pope 2015 the facies from Formation Image Logs FMI Log for the intervals without cores was applied create a qualitative facies log based on the sidewall-core facies and di erences in image texture Wireline logs gamma ray especially and thin-sections from sidewall-core samples were used as additional data in order to determine and interpret the facies Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANning electron microscopy QEMSCAN and X-Ray Di raction XRD data were also obtained for di erent facies Chemical and mineralogical maps of 10 representative thin-sections were produced using a QEMSCAN 650 automated mineralogical mapping instrument with accelerating voltage of 15 kV and 10 m spot size The mineralogical maps show the spatial distribution of mineral phases and the relationship between them their abundance was quanti ed as area percentages or percentage of mass considering the theoretical density of minerals Quantities lower than 0 01 were ignored Chemical analysis was performed on 590 samples from Well 3 core samples using ICP-OES Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry in order to determine the elemental abundance of Al2O3 Fe2O3 CaO Cr2O3 K2O MgO MnO Na2O SiO2 and TiO2 Most analytical chemical data are of a closed form where individual components are summed yielding an identical total As result as some elements increase in relative abundance others must decrease This aspect leads to correlation measures and graphical presentations that do not re ect the true underlying relationships This constraint can be corrected before multivariate statistical analysis by making a centred log-ratio transformation CLR as described by Montero-Serrano et al 2010 The chemical data after CLR and the detrital grain abundance from XRD data were interpreted using Principal Component Analysis PCA to understand the correlation between these variables Finally vertical variations in facies detrital content and elemental composition were used qualitatively to identify the basic cycles 4 Facies classi cation The Barra Velha facies samples from the eight wells are dominated by variable amounts of three components that were formed in situ mud understood as ne-grained components microcrystalline calcite and clay minerals calcite spherulites and fascicular-optic calcite shrubs These have been described in previous studies of Pre-salt carbonates in the Santos and Campos basins as well as from the Namibian and Kwanza basins However there is a lack of consensus as to the processes responsible for formation of some of these components Here we describe the main component grains in our study area and propose a new facies classi cation 4 2 Facies classi cation The triangular diagram Fig 8 shows the proposed classi cation that encapsulates the range of combinations of the three main components where there is no evidence of signi cant reworking The most abundant component gives a rock name and the secondary component provides a qualifying adjective Figs 4 6 show thin-section examples of each facies type de ned In addition an adjective for the main diagenetic event can be added for example dolomitic spherulitestone Fig 6 g and h silici ed spherulitestone or dissolved spherulitestone In order to provide su cient categories to di erentiate rocks of signi cantly di erent composition the classi cation triangle for in situ deposits Fig 8 is subdivided into nine rock types The percentage values selected for the boundaries are those that provide a convenient separation of common combinations described in cores and thin-sections In the classi cation of an essentially continuous series all divisions are arbitrary Folk 1959 The boundaries used in the proposed classi cation unavoidably re ect personal opinion but it is suggested they coincide with a separation of components formed by di erent processes The in situ carbonates comprising more than 90 of shrubs spherulites or mud-rich end-members are designated shrubstone spherulitestone and mudstone respectively Fig 8 The combination of more than 50 shrubs and less than 10 mud separates spherulitic shrubstone from shrubby spherulitestone Rocks with more than 10 4 1 Description of main components Mud The ne-grained material in the Pre-salt carbonates as matrix between grains and as beds is broadly referred to as mud This includes that comprised of clay minerals calcite dolomite and silica Petrographically the clays occur as optically clear grains of clay aggregates usually within beds which are massive or have a ne millimetric-scale lamination examples of these are shown in Fig 4 The clay minerals may show a degree of replacement by microcrystalline dolomite and microcrystalline silica In other cases the ne-grained sediment is micrite which is mostly composed of calcite but may show a degree of replacement by dolomite and silica Some of the dolomite silica could be primary but likely formed via a metastable precursor In general the light cream to dark brown coloured sediments show a plane-parallel to smooth wavy lamination with thicknesses varying from millimetres to centimetres examples of these are shown in Fig 5 Optical microscopy shows that the light laminae are composed of microcrystalline calcite and the dark bands are composed of microcrystalline and rhombohedral dolomite and organic matter Some mud samples contain ne siliciclastic grains ostracods and phosphatic 5 Marine and Petroleum Geology
