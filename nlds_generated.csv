Its distinct physical properties present significant challenges for both drilling operations and seismic imaging.",ROCHA
marls,"Marls are a type of mixed sedimentary rock that consists of a consolidated mixture of carbonate minerals, primarily calcite, and siliciclastic mud in roughly equal proportions, forming an intermediate lithology between a mudstone and a limestone.",ROCHA
Cenomanian,"The Cenomanian is the earliest geologic age of the Late Cretaceous Epoch that is preceded by the Albian Age and followed by the Turonian Age. This time interval spans from approximately 100.5 to 93.9 million years ago. The corresponding chronostratigraphic unit, representing the rock record from this age, is known as the Cenomanian Stage.",UNIDADE_CRONO
FMI Itapema,"The Itapema Formation is a lithostratigraphic unit of the Guaratiba Group that is characterized by lacustrine carbonate deposits of Aptian age in the Santos Basin. Its main lithofacies are composed of coquinas (bioclastic limestones) and spherulitic limestones (microbialites), which were deposited in a saline alkaline lake system. This unit represents the basal section of the Pre-Salt carbonate succession and constitutes one of its most important petroleum reservoirs.",UNIDADE_LITO
deposits,"A deposit is a body of naturally occurring geological material that has accumulated through physical, chemical, or biological sedimentary processes. It is composed of particles derived from pre-existing rocks, minerals precipitated from solution, or organic matter. Through burial and diagenesis, an unconsolidated deposit is transformed into a sedimentary rock.",ROCHA
magnesian clay,"A magnesian clay is an unconsolidated argillaceous material that is chemically precipitated and composed predominantly of magnesium-rich phyllosilicates. These minerals, such as stevensite or sepiolite, typically form in alkaline lacustrine environments characteristic of pre-salt depositional systems.",NAO_CONSOLID
clay minerals,"Clay minerals are a group of hydrous aluminum phyllosilicate minerals that are formed predominantly by the chemical weathering of other silicate minerals. They are characterized by their very fine particle size, typically less than 2 micrometers, and their ability to develop plasticity when mixed with a limited amount of water. Their layered crystal structure allows them to have a high cation exchange capacity, making them geochemically reactive and significant in both reservoir quality and drilling operations.",MINERAIS
sublittoral,A sublittoral paleoenvironment is a marine depositional environment that corresponds to the seafloor extending from the mean low water line to the edge of the continental shelf. This permanently submerged zone is characteristically situated below the fair-weather wave base but remains within the influence of storm processes. The resulting sedimentary record typically consists of fine-grained siliciclastics or neritic carbonates formed within the photic zone.,PALEOAMBIENTE
magnesian,"A magnesian rock is a rock that is characterized by a significant content of magnesium, primarily incorporated into the crystal lattice of its constituent minerals. This element is a key component of carbonate minerals, such as dolomite and high-magnesium calcite, and of ferromagnesian silicates, such as olivine and pyroxene. The term is commonly used to describe carbonate rocks that are intermediate in composition between limestone and dolostone.",ROCHA
carbonate rocks,"Carbonate rocks are sedimentary rocks that are composed of more than 50% carbonate minerals, primarily calcite and dolomite. These rocks typically form through the accumulation and lithification of biogenic skeletal fragments or by direct chemical precipitation from water. Limestone and dolostone are the principal types of carbonate rocks.",ROCHA
Upper Aptian,"The Upper Aptian is a chronostratigraphic substage that comprises the upper part of the Aptian Stage, corresponding to all rocks deposited during the Late Aptian Age. It is positioned stratigraphically below the Albian Stage and above the Lower Aptian substage. In the South Atlantic marginal basins, this unit is particularly significant as it encompasses the main sag-phase carbonate reservoirs of the Pre-Salt succession.",UNIDADE_CRONO
Santos Namibe,"The Santos-Namibe Basin is a composite paleo-basin that represents the large, integrated depositional system spanning the Brazilian and West African margins prior to the complete opening of the South Atlantic Ocean. It encompasses the conjugate margins of the present-day Santos Basin in Brazil and the Namibe Basin in Angola and Namibia, which were contiguous during the Early Cretaceous. This system is defined by the extensive sag-phase lacustrine deposition that formed the prolific source rocks and microbial carbonate reservoirs of the Pre-Salt petroleum province.",BACIA
Cenozoic,"The Cenozoic is a geochronologic era of the Phanerozoic Eon that represents the current and most recent interval of geologic time, extending from the end of the Mesozoic Era approximately 66 million years ago to the present day. It is characterized by the diversification and dominance of mammals following the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. This era is subdivided into the Paleogene, Neogene, and Quaternary periods.",UNIDADE_CRONO
ooliths,"Ooliths are a type of coated sedimentary grain that consists of concentric layers of a chemical precipitate, typically calcium carbonate, formed around a nucleus which is often a fossil fragment or bioclast.",FOSSEIS
oncoid,"An oncoid is an unattached, spheroidal microbialite that consists of irregular, concentric laminae formed by the accretion of microbial mats around a central nucleus.",FOSSEIS
calcirudite,A calcirudite is a clastic carbonate rock that is predominantly composed of carbonate grains larger than two millimeters in diameter. It is the lithified equivalent of a carbonate gravel and is analogous to a conglomerate or breccia in siliciclastic terminology. These rocks are indicative of deposition in high-energy environments.,MINERAIS
TOC,"TOC is an informal lithostratigraphic unit of the Barra Velha Formation that is defined by the association of microbialitic and bioclastic facies. It is primarily composed of tufas, spherulites (oncoids), and coquinas of bivalve and gastropod shells. This unit constitutes a significant reservoir interval within the Aptian lacustrine carbonate succession of the Santos Basin Pre-Salt.",UNIDADE_LITO
carboniferous,"The Carboniferous is a geologic period of the Paleozoic Era that extends from approximately 358.9 to 298.9 million years ago, following the Devonian and preceding the Permian. It is named for the vast coal beds that were formed globally from the remains of extensive swamp forests. The corresponding rocks deposited during this time constitute the Carboniferous System.",UNIDADE_CRONO
